    "abstract": "Abstract Improvement of agricultural water use efficiency is of major concern with drought problems being one of the most important factors limiting grain production worldwide. Effective management of water for crop production in water-scarce areas requires efficient approaches. Increasing crop water use efficiency and drought tolerance by genetic improvement and physiological regulation may be a means to achieve efficient and effective use of water. A limited water supply inhibits the photosynthesis of plants, causes changes of chlorophyll contents and components and damage to photosynthetic apparatus. It also inhibits photochemical activities and decreases the activities of enzymes in plants. Water stress is one of the important factors inhibiting the growth and photosynthetic abilities of plants through disturbing the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species and the antioxidant defence, causing accumulation of reactive oxygen species which induce oxidative stress to proteins, membrane lipids and other cellular components. A number of approaches are being used to enhance water use efficiency and to minimize the detrimental effect of water stress in crop plants. Proper plant nutrition is a good strategy to enhance water use efficiency and productivity in crop plants. Plant nutrients play a very important role in enhancing water use efficiency under limited water supply. In this paper we discuss the possible effective techniques to improve water use efficiency and some macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium), micronutrients (zinc, boron, iron, manganese, molybdenum and chloride), and silicon (a beneficial nutrient) in detail to show how these nutrients play their role in enhancing water use efficiency in crop plant.",

    "abstract": "Here we selected eight types of feedstocks to assess the effects of pyrolysis temperature (300°C, 400°C, 500°C and 600°C) and residence time (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h), respectively, on the physicochemical properties. The fixed-carbon content, pH value and amount of basic functional groups in biochars increased as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300°C to 600°C; the opposite trend was found in the biochar yield, adsorption capacity and amount of acidic functional groups. Increasing the residence time at low pyrolysis temperature (300°C) resulted in a gradual reduction in the biochar yield and progressive increase in the pH and iodine adsorption number of biochars. However, increasing the residence time at high pyrolysis temperature (600°C) had little effect on the biochar yield or pH, while it decreased the iodine adsorption number of biochars. Given the effects of pyrolysis conditions on the pH and iodine adsorption number of biochars, low-ash agricultural wastes (e.g. wheat straw) can be pyrolysed at 300°C, 2 h to produce biochar for improving alkaline soils; high-ash agricultural wastes (e.g. sweet potato vine) and forest litter (e.g. fresh leaves of apricot tree) are preferably pyrolysed at 300°C, 4 h to produce biochar for use in acidic soils.",

    "abstract": "Increasing areas of agricultural land in high rainfall areas of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where crop production used to be reliable, are affected by soil acidity. This review focuses on the extent, causes and effect of soil acidity on soil properties and crop yield and its management from the context of SSA. Studies showed that the detrimental effects of soil acidity can be mitigated through liming, integrated acid soil management and the use of acid-tolerant germplasms. Application of lime resulted in yield increments of 34–252% in wheat, barley and tef, 29–53% in faba bean and soybean, and 42–332% in potato in Ethiopia, 111–182% in maize in Kenya, and 45–103% in Mucuna in Nigeria under moderate to severe acid soil conditions. This was accompanied by a corresponding increase in soil pH up to 1.9 units and a decrease in exchangeable acidity and aluminum up to 2.1 cmol kg−1. Use of acid-tolerant crop varieties such as maize expressing superior tolerance to Al toxicity resulted in a yield increase of 51% under low soil pH in Cameroon and Kenya. Overall, soil acidity covering ∼35% of SSA should be reclaimed with lime and integrated acid soil management interventions, which could significantly increase crop yield and enhance the resilience of the tropical agroecosystems. .",

Starting four weeks after planting, HA was applied via spraying and/or drenching to the plant root area three times during the growth period at 15-day intervals. HA treatments had no significant effect on fruit firmness, fruit length, or diameter. Total and reducing sugar contents significantly increased in response to both foliar and soil HA treatments. Moreover, HA application significantly influenced total chlorophyll content and this effect was mainly on chlorophyll b content. Foliar 20 ml/l and soil 20 ml/l HA application resulted in the highest total chlorophyll content. Foliar and soil HA applications also led to significantly higher mean fruit weight, and early and total yield than for control.

Both foliar and soil HA treatments positively affected fruit characteristics including fruit diameter, fruit height, mean fruit weight and fruit number per plant. Similarly, HA treatments increased the early yield of tomato compared to control. The yield of tomato was significantly influenced by soil and foliar HA applications. The highest yield occurred in foliar 20 ml/l HA treatment. The study shows that 20 ml/l concentration of HA sprays could be successfully used to obtain better growth and yield in tomato.",

It is an important plant with several medicinal, and nutritional values used in Asian and Chinese Tradition medicine. Ginger and its general compounds such as Fe, Mg, Ca, vitamin C, flavonoids, phenolic compounds (gingerdiol, gingerol, gingerdione and shogaols), sesquiterpenes, paradols has long been used as an herbal medicine to treat various symptoms including vomiting, pain, cold symptoms and it has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-tumour activities, anti-pyretic, anti-platelet, anti-tumourigenic, anti-hyperglycaemic, antioxidant anti-diabetic, anti-clotting and analgesic properties, cardiotonic, cytotoxic. It has been widely used for arthritis, cramps, sprains, sore throats, rheumatism, muscular aches, pains, vomiting, constipation, indigestion, hypertension, dementia, fever and infectious diseases. Ginger leaves have also been used for food-flavouring and Asian Traditional Medicine especially in China. Ginger oil also used as food-flavouring agent in soft drink, as spices in bakery products, in confectionary items, pickles, sauces and as preservatives. Ginger is available in three forms, namely fresh root ginger, preserved ginger and dried ginger. The pharmacological activities of ginger were mainly attributed to its active phytocompounds 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol, zingerone beside other phenolics and flavonoids. Gingerol and shogaol in particular, is known to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In both Traditional Chinese Medicine, and modern China, Ginger is used in about half of all herbal prescriptions. Traditional medicinal plants are often cheaper, locally available and easily consumable raw and as simple medicinal preparations. The obtained findings suggest potential of ginger extract as an additive in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",

The utilisation of synthetic pesticides has been the predominant control processor for diseases brought about by phytopathogenic microorganisms. Notwithstanding, their open and improper application in intensive agriculture has realised issues that have prompted ecological contamination, considerable residues in agricultural products and phytopathogen resistance. They are likewise disrupting the quantity of beneficial microorganism which is available in the soil and capable of expanding soil fertility. Along these lines, there is a need to look through the option of synthetic pesticides that are safe, environmental and monetarily feasible to confront this problem. Biocontrol agent's utilisation is the best alternative method to control the different kinds of diseases, such as nematode infestation, fungal pathogen and bacterial pathogen. Nowadays, biocontrol agents assume a significant role in the field of agriculture. It is a financially savvy, environment-friendly and inhibits the advancement of pathogenic microorganism sustainably. This review emphasises the role of biocontrol agents against different pathogenic microorganisms and their significance potentiality to improve plant growth and enhance defence system of plants.",

At Gum Selassa, shrubland decreased by 1.26 ha y−1 while at Maileba it showed a slight positive increment of 0.38 ha y−1. Area under settlement increased by a greater magnitude at Maileba (6.3 ha y−1) and a slight increase at Gum Selassa (1.4 ha y−1) in response to the rapid population increase. These changes in land uses/cover brought significant deleterious impacts on land degradation and surface runoff. The cumulative degradation index (DI) was negative for all land uses, with a higher value under Eucalyptus plantation (DI=−282) followed by cultivated land (DI=−260) at Maileba. Changes in land use/cover also decreased the water-storage capacity of soils by 1.63 and 1.09 mm y−1 at Gum Selassa and Maileba, respectively, with a corresponding increase in surface runoff by 2.7 and 2.3 mm y−1. Generally, the observed changes in land degradation and surface runoff are highly linked to the change in land use/land cover.",

    "abstract": "Genotypes evaluation for stability and high yielding in rice is an important factor for sustainable rice production and food security. These evaluations are essential especially when the objective of the breeding program is to select lines with high adaptability and stability. This study was conducted to investigate G × E interaction over ten environments across the peninsular Malaysia for yield stability in fifteen rice genotypes comprising twelve mutant lines and three established varieties. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications across the environments. Yield component traits were evaluated over multiple harvests and measured as number of tillers per hill, filled grains per panicle, grain weight per hill and yield per hectare. Data analyses were through analyses of variance and stability analyses were conducted for univariate and multivariate stability parameters. The pooled analysis of variance showed highly significant differences among genotypes, locations, seasons, and genotypes by environment (G × E interaction) for all the traits. Based on univariate (bi, , σi2, Wi2, YSi) and multivariate (AMMI and GGE biplot) stability parameters, rice genotypes were classified into three main groups. The first group are genotypes having high stability along with high yield. These genotypes are widely adapted to diverse environmental conditions. The second group is a genotype that exhibited high yield but low stability, this genotype is suitable for specific environments. The last group is genotypes with low yield and high stability. Genotypes in this class are more suitable for breeding specific traits or yield component compensation such as the capacity to recover rapidly from stresses. Significant rank correlations were measured for regression slope (bi), deviation from regression (), Shukla stability variance (), Wricke's ecovalence (), and Kang stability statistic (YSi) for all the traits.",

The TOC content recorded the highest value in undisturbed forest (45.4 g kg−1 soil) and lowest in barren land (18.4 g kg−1 soil). The MBC values varied from 146 mg kg−1 in barren land to 783 mg kg−1 in undisturbed oak forest. Land under organic farming showed higher LC values (4.0 g kg−1) than soya bean–wheat and fodder crops. The average POC values ranged from 0.9 g kg−1 in barren land to 11.0 g kg−1 in undisturbed oak forest. Variation of these parameters with season and depth was also observed. The CMI was highest under the forest ecosystem and lowest in barren land. Our study thus revealed that cultivation of Himalayan soils has significantly reduced the soil organic carbon pools and thus maintenance of natural forest or eco-friendly practices such as inclusion of legumes and application of organics is urgently needed for sustainable use of these ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Excessive use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers in wheat fields has led to elevated NO3-N concentrations in groundwater and reduced N use efficiency. Three-year field and 15N tracing experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of N application rates on N uptake from basal and topdressing 15N, N use efficiency, and grain yield in winter wheat plants; and determine the dynamics of N derived from both basal and topdressing 15N in soil in high-yielding fields. The results showed that 69.5–84.5% of N accumulated in wheat plants derived from soil, while 6.0–12.5%and 9.2–18.1% derived from basal 15N and top 15N fertilizer, respectively. The basal N fertilizer recovery averaged 33.9% in plants, residual averaged 59.2% in 0–200 cm depth soil; the topdressing N fertilizer recovery averaged 50.5% in plants, residual averaged 48.2% in 0–200 cm soil. More top 15N was accumulated in plants and more remained in 0–100 cm soil rather than in 100–200 cm soil at maturity, compared with the basal 15N. However, during the period from pre-sowing to pre-wintering, the soil nitrate moved down to deeper layers, and most accumulated in the layers below 140 cm. With an increase of N fertilizer rate, the proportion of the N derived from soil in plants decreased, but that derived from basal and topdressing fertilizer increased; the proportion of basal and top 15N recovery in plants decreased, and that of residual in soil increased. A moderate application rate of 96–168 kg N ha−1 led to increases in nitrate content in 0–60 cm soil layer, N uptake amount, grain yield and apparent recovery fraction of applied fertilizer N in wheat. Applying above 240 kg N ha−1 promoted the downward movement of basal and top 15N and soil nitrate, but had no significant effect on N uptake amount; the excessive N application also obviously decreased the grain yield, N uptake efficiency, apparent recovery fraction of applied fertilizer N, physiological efficiency and internal N use efficiency. It is suggested that the appropriate application rate of nitrogen on a high-yielding wheat field was 96–168 kg N ha−1.",

    "abstract": "Grain legumes, including cowpea, are the cheapest sources of minerals and protein to enhance human nutrition. Cultivar development and deployment of cowpea with increased grain mineral content and protein composition rely on selection of genetically unique and complementary breeding lines. The objective of this study was to assess the grain minerals and protein composition of diverse cowpea collections of eastern, southern and western Africa to select promising parents to develop a breeding population. Twenty-two genetically diverse cowpea genotypes were field evaluated using a randomised complete block design with three replications in two locations in South Africa. The dried grain mineral contents were determined using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometre, while the protein content was determined by the combustion method. Analyses of variance showed significant (P < 0.05) effects of genotypes, locations and their interactions. The test genotypes showed considerable variation for the following nine mineral contents: calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), phosphorus (P), and zinc (Zn) varying from 0.07 to 0.12 mg kg−1; 4.46 to 7.81 mg kg−1; 0.06 to 0.11 g; 11.82 to 14.45 g; 1.86 to 2.27 g; 9.24 to 13.30 mg kg−1; 0.26 to 0.80 g; 4.63 to 5.92 g and 0.03.00 to 0.05 g, respectively. Further, the total protein content varied from 23.16 to 28.13%. Significant correlations were detected among some mineral elements and total protein content, suggesting the possibility of simultaneous selection for these traits. The principal component analysis (PCA) identified four principal components (PCs) contributing to 70.93% of the total explained variation amongst genotypes. Overall the following genotypes with desirable grain mineral and protein attributes were selected: IT90K-59 (Ca), 98K-5301 (Ca and protein), ITOOK-1060 (Cu), ITOOK-1217 and IT845-2246 (Fe), Bensogla (K, Na, and P), TVU11424 and ITOOK-1217 (Mg), CH14 (Mn and Na), TVU12637 (Mn) and Glenda and Vuli (Zn).

    "abstract": "With increasing demand for sustainable production, the need to effectively utilise site-based resources increases. One such resource is the remaining crop residues, both above and below ground, after harvest. In order to assess the magnitude of this resource, this study determined the plant nutrient contribution of residues from 17 different crops in seven different regions of Slovakia over a nine-year period. The soil profile 0.0–0.3 m was taken into account at belowground residues sampling. The results showed that winter rape, mustard, corn maize, triticale, winter rye with straw and sunflower left the most residues, exceeding 8 tons of dry biomass per hectare. Root crops (sugar beet, potatoes) and peas left less than 3 tons of residual dry biomass per hectare. Using these data, the nutrient potential coefficient, i.e. the amount of nutrients left by production of one ton of the main product was calculated by polynomial regression. With these coefficients and the known yield of a given crop, it was possible to calculate how much nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium each crop leaves in the soil after harvest. It was found that the amount of nitrogen left ranged from 20 to 132 kg, phosphorus from 2 to 24 kg and potassium from 13 to 218 kg per hectare. This has to be taken into account when calculating the fertiliser requirement of the subsequent crop in order to achieve better resource utilisation, thereby reducing the risk of eutrophication and improving farm profits by reducing expenditure on fertiliser.",

In some cases, fruit quality such as in tomato, can be improved by irrigation with saline water. The influence of different salt concentrations on physiological responses and the expression of some selected genes of cherry tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L), cv. West Virginia 106, was examined. Tomato plants were grown in peatmoss substrate and irrigated with 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 or 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) in a glasshouse. The NaCl treatments of 75, 100 and 150 mM salt resulted in shorter plants, decreased stem width, a lower plant dry weight, fewer flowers, and smaller leaf area, while yield was reduced by treatment with concentrations of 50 mM NaCl and above. Average fruit weight and fruit number were also negatively affected by treatment with 50 mM salt and above. Salinity treatment led to increased fruit total soluble solids, titratable acidity and firmness and improved the taste index. Salt-responsive marker genes identified in Moneymaker were also induced in cherry tomato but not at the highest salt concentrations. Our results indicated that cherry tomato treated with 25 mM NaCl produced fruit with improved quality in comparison with non-salinized control plants without compromising yield, while at 50 and 75 mM the improved fruit quality was accompanied by a reduction in yield.",

    "abstract": "Ethiopia is the primary wheat producer in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) owing to the suitable agro-ecological conditions. Despite wheats economic potential for food security, the actual yield under smallholder farmers conditions is low due to various production constraints. Thus, the objectives of this study were to assess the present wheat production opportunities and constraints and identify farmer-preferred traits to guide variety design with stem rust-resistance and economic traits in eastern Ethiopia. Data on production constraints and trait preferences were collected using structured questionnaires involving 144 wheat-producing farmers. Wheat rust (reported by 97.3% of respondents), small land size (90.4%) and a lack of improved varieties (75.6%) were identified as the major constraints. About 41.7% of respondents in the West-Hararghe and 27.8% in the East-Hararghe zones did not use crop protection strategies to control rusts. Substantial respondent farmers used cultural practices (18.8%), rust-resistant cultivars (13.2%) or, a combination of these (10.4%) to control rust diseases. The essential farmer preferred traits in a wheat variety were rust resistance, high yield potential and good quality grain for bread making. Therefore, there is a need to breed new varieties with high grain yield and quality and durable rust resistance for sustainable wheat production in eastern Ethiopia.",

Also, the fraction of exchangeable magnesium is considerable, while the monovalent cations only occupy a few percent of sites. Among the monovalent ions potassium is withheld more strongly than sodium. Therefore, potassium ions only leak out by drainage in small amounts until the soil is overfertilized by potassium. The first year's result of applying potassium chloride may lead to a higher yield even when the soil is not deficient in potassium, because chloride may increase the amount of dissolved cations in the soil solution. If a larger amount of potassium is applied than removed by the crop, potassium is accumulated in the soil and this leads to an antagonistic effect on the uptake of magnesium and calcium. The antagonistic effect of potassium was found to be considerable when the activity ratio between potassium and calcium in a soil extract (1 part soil to 2 parts water) during the period of growth and after harvest was higher than 10 (μmol kg-1 soil)1/2.",

    "abstract": "Twelve long-term soil fertility field experiments in south, central and north Sweden were started in the period 1957-1969. Five of the experiments, two in south and three in central Sweden, were situated at favourable sites, the other seven were placed at sites with less favourable climatic conditions and natural soil properties. Two crop rotations, one with and one without livestock and 16 combinations of inorganic NPK (nitrogen phosphorus potassium) fertilizers were compared in the south and central Swedish experiments. In north Sweden, there was one rotation with livestock and 30 NPK combinations. There was a four-course rotation in the south, a six-course in central Sweden and a seven-course rotation in north Sweden. The ordinary fertilizer treatments in the rotations without livestock almost doubled the yields of cereals compared with the unfertilized plots; with more fertilizer yields were even larger. In the livestock rotations the mineral fertilizer effects were smaller owing to positive effects of the manure. N responses were always considerably greater than PK responses. In north Sweden yield responses were of the same magnitude as in south and central Sweden. With no fertilizers, in the livestock rotations the uptakes of N, P and K were 50-90, 10-15 and 30-100 kg ha -1 , respectively, depending on the crop. In the non-livestock rotations corresponding values were 25-40, 7-10 and 10-25 kg. In north Sweden the N removal was even higher owing to the large proportion of ley in the rotation. In zero N treatments in south Sweden, over a 24 year period, losses of organic matter were nearly 10 t ha -1 in the non-livestock rotation and about half as much in the livestock rotation. With 100 kg N ha -1 losses were negligible. Levels of AL-extractable P were not maintained where P additions equalled offtakes in the crops, but decreased by about 1 unit during the period. P dynamics differed between sites; on some, P fertilizer had no effect on either yields or soil P, whereas in other cases P fertilization increased yields and kept soil P in plant-available forms. The cadmium content in sugar beet roots increased with increased NPK fertilization, but the increases were smaller than differences between sites. The cadmium content varied from 128 to 288 ppb.",

All fields in all rotations are represented in each year. The experimental factors are defined to allow management to be adjusted for optimization of the individual treatment combinations. This makes the systems more realistic and the results more applicable in practical farming. The experiment is being conducted at four locations representing major soil types and climate regions in Denmark. The main design criteria are related to requirements for a long-term experiment and the need for performing studies and experiments within the experiment itself.",

High K applications (125 and 200 kg K/ha) significantly increased rate of growth of the vegetative parts of the crop. With high K application the leaf area increased up to 26% at anthesis, and top dry matter accumulation increased up to 15% between anthesis and milk-ripe stages of growth, resulting in about 10% higher straw yield at final harvest. Also, the number of ears increased with high K application. Final grain yield was unaffected by level of K application in fully irrigated plots. Drought during the grain-filling period decreased grain yield by decreasing grain weight and number of grains per ear. However, with high K application at medium level of drought, reduction in grain yield tended to be less. Water-use efficiency (WUE) for total dry matter production was increased up to 12% by high K application; however, WUE for grain production was unaffected by the level of K application. High K application significantly increased root density in the subsoil in the wet year of 1987, while in the dry year of 1986 no differences could be detected between K levels. Despite the low effect of high K application on final grain yield, the induced increase of the vegetative dry matter accumulation is of economical importance when the total above-ground biomass of the barley crop is used for cattle fodder.",

In order to learn how magnetic fields affect plants, the effects of alternating the magnetic field (MF) on the yield and ion accumulation in the leaves of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) was studied. Short day strawberry cv. Camarosa plants were treated with magnetic field (MF) strengths of 0.096, 0.192 and 0.384 Tesla (T) in heated greenhouse conditions. Fruit yield and fruit number per plant, and average fruit weight were higher at low MF strength than control and high MF strength. Increasing MF strength from control to 0.096 T increased fruit yield per plant (208.50 and 246.07 g, respectively) and fruit number per plant (25.9 and 27.6, respectively), but higher MF strengths than 0.096 T reduced fruit yield and fruit number. All of the MF strengths increased average fruit weight as compared with the control, although the largest fruit weight (8.92 g) was obtained at 0.096 T strength. Increasing MF strength from control to 0.384 T increased contents of N, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, Na and Zn, but reduced P and S content.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate plant available water were developed from a database of arable soils in Sweden. The PTFs were developed to fulfil the minimum requirements of any agro-hydrological application, i.e., soil water content at wilting point (θ wp ) and field capacity (θ fc ), from information that frequently is available from soil surveys such as texture and soil organic carbon content (SOC). From the same variables we also estimated bulk density (ρ) and porosity (ε), which seldom are included in surveys, but are needed for calculating element mass balances. The seven particle-size classes given in the data set were aggregated in different ways to match information commonly gained from surveys. Analysis of covariance and stepwise multiple linear regression were used for quantifying the influence of depth, particle size class, textural class and soil organic carbon on the characteristic variables. PTFs developed from other data sets were also tested and their goodness-of-fit and bias was evaluated. These functions and those developed for the Swedish database were also tested on an independent data set and finally ranked according to their goodness of fit. Among single independent variables, clay was the best predictor for θ wp , sand (or the sum of clay and silt) for θ fc and SOC for ρ and ε. A large fraction of the variation in θ wp and θ fc is explained by soil texture and SOC (up to 90%) and root mean square errors (RMSEs) were as small as 0.03 m3 water m−3 soil in the best models. For the prediction of ρ and ε in the test data set, the best PTF could only explain 40–43% of the total variance with corresponding RMSEs of 0.14 g cm−3 and 5.3% by volume, respectively. Recently presented PTFs derived from a North American database performed very well for estimating θ wp (low error and bias) and could be recommended for Swedish soils if measurements of clay, sand and SOC were available. Although somewhat less accurately, also θ fc could be estimated satisfactorily. This indicates that the determination of plant available water by texture and SOC is rather independent of soil genesis and that certain PTFs are transferable between continents.",

Intercropping garlic may effectively relieve this obstacle due to its allelopathic and antimicrobial effects. A two-growing season investigation was carried out during autumn 2009 to spring 2010 in plastic tunnel to determine the effects of intercropped garlic and green garlic on the overall growth of cucumber and soil biological properties. Results showed that green garlic exhibited the inhibitory effect on the growth of cucumber in spring cultivation 2010. Garlic–cucumber intercropping system increased yield of cucumber differently depending on garlic cultivars, with only cv. G005 showing significant increase (13.4%). Intercropping systems were evaluated as a greater net benefit system as compared to monoculture cultivation. Populations of soil bacteria and actinomyces were stimulated, while fungi were inhibited under intercropping system. Activities of soil invertase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase were encouraged under intercropping system in spring cultivation 2010 compared with monoculture. The promotion effect of intercropped garlic on urease and alkaline phosphatase maintained till garlic harvest. These results suggest that intercropping system can improve soil biology environment and alleviate continuous cropping obstacle of cucumber at different levels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main crops on which plastic mulch is widely used in Mexico include tomato, bell pepper, eggplant, melons, watermelons, and strawberry; however, very little research has been performed on potato. One of the main benefits associated with plastic mulching is the modification of the microclimate around the plant. To obtain a positive microclimate modification studies are required to understand how plastic mulch affects growth and yield of a given species. Previous field research assessing the response to colored plastic mulching in potato shows no consistent results on yield, maybe because it has been performed under different geographical latitudes. Potato in Mexico is conventionally cultivated on bare soil combined with various irrigation systems. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of colored plastic mulches on soil temperature, growth, yield and photosynthetic response of potato plants. The experiment was conducted in Northeast Mexico and the treatments included were: black plastic mulch (BPM); white-on-black plastic mulch (W/B), silver-on-black (SPM), aluminum-on-black plastic mulch (APM) and a control that consisted of bare soil cultivated plants. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Results suggest that average daily mean soil temperature was linearly and negatively correlated with total yield and yield of first-quality tubers. Total yield and yield of first-quality tubers of plants mulched with W/B, SPM and APM was significantly higher (p≤0.05) than those of control plants. Leaf area and shoot dry weight were increased when soil temperatures were higher due to the effect of radiation transmission to the soil, however, this decrease was associated with a decrease in tuber production. The results of our study indicate that plants grown under BPM, which induced the highest soil temperature, showed marginal difference in yield compared with control plants, suggesting that colored plastic mulches have a positive effect on yield through decreased rise in soil temperature.",

In this article, the effect of S fertilization on faba bean's capability of N2 fixation, grain yield and chemical characteristics in terms of protein fractions, fatty acids and minerals composition is reported. A randomized, complete block design with three replicates was used, and three S applications (0, 30 and 60 kg ha−1, respectively) for faba bean were performed. The S fertilization was split into two applications: 50% before sowing and 50% in the beginning of March as K2SO4. At the same time, both the legume and oat crops were fertilized uniformly with 10 kg N ha−1 as 15N NH4 15NO3 (10% 15N atomic excess) in solution form. In a Mediterranean climate under optimal spring rainfall situations, faba bean produced high yield of grain and protein. Sulphur application resulted in an increase in overall plant yield and N2 fixation. In addition, S fertilization enhanced the protein quality, increasing its degradable fraction. Fertilizing faba bean with 30 kg ha−1 of S resulted in a more appropriate dose in order to obtain a quantitative and qualitative crop improvement. From our findings, it can be concluded that S fertilization to faba bean should be recommended to soils with suboptimal S levels to obtain maximum seed and protein yields.",

This study investigated the predictive capability of the K-value estimated by Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) and Dg models for different soil regions using a Chinese soil erodibility database covering 51 natural runoff plots. Model performance was evaluated using R 2 (coefficient of determination), relative error (RE), Nash–Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) and P value (Mann–Whitney U test) statistics. The results showed that the existing four models overestimated almost all the K-values for the Chinese erodibility database, with most observed values concentrated in the range of 0.015–0.035. Without calibration, only the USLE and Dg models could be reliable and directly applied for the black soil region and the loess soil region, respectively. The Dg–OM model (R 2=0.67, n=32) was established by the non-linear best fitting techniques of multiple regression. In the Dg–OM model, K-values accounted for the vibration in a combination of the D g (geometric mean diameter) and OM (soil organic matter). NSE, R 2 and the average RE was 0.94, 0.67 and 9.5% for the Dg–OM model's calibration based on the Chinese erodibility database; similar results were found for the validation process, with NSE of 0.93, R 2 of 0.66 and average RE of 6.5%. The model performances showed that the Dg–OM model reached 'good' satisfactory level. Compared with the four existing erodibility models, the Dg–OM model permitted the best parameterization and accuracy, and was proved to be suitable for estimating soil erodibility values in China.",

As the article concludes, there is a new research agenda emerging around the role of the multi-level state, the planning system and sustainability research in scaling up and out these governance innovations.",

This study investigated the effects of N fertiliser input and harvest date on the yield and chemical composition of five common grass species, and made comparisons with red clover. Perennial ryegrass (PRG), Italian ryegrass (IRG), tall fescue, cocksfoot, timothy and red clover were grown under two inorganic N fertiliser inputs (0 kg N ha−1 and 125 kg N ha−1; except red clover) and harvested at five dates (fortnightly from 12 May to 7 July) in the primary growth. Regression analysis of these data allowed comparison of the yield and chemical composition of each grass species at common growth stages, without the confounding effects of variation in maturity between grass species at common harvest dates. Of the grass species investigated, timothy was most productive in terms of dry matter (DM) yield and thus has the potential to provide a cheaper feed per unit DM. However, the most digestible grass species was PRG, with timothy being the lowest, and this could impact on both animal and bioenergy production potential. The most suitable grass species for ensiling was IRG (particularly when grown without fertiliser N) due to its higher water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentration and lower buffering capacity (BC) compared to all other grass species. In comparison to the grasses receiving inorganic N fertiliser, red clover had a numerically lower DM yield, but a higher mean DM digestibility and crude protein concentration. The lower WSC concentration and higher BC of the red clover may result in a greater preservation challenge during ensiling.",

We showed that treatment with all three bio-inoculants significantly increased the shoot length, root length, shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, and chlorophyll content, via secretion of indole acetic acid and/or organic acids. Inoculation with R. sphaeroides had more favorable effect on plant growth than did inoculation with L. plantarum or S. cerevisiae, by significantly enhancing the gibberellin and reducing the abscisic acid contents. The results of amino acid analysis revealed that inoculation with R. sphaeroides, L. plantarum, and S. cerevisiae generally increased the contents of 17 amino acids, namely, aspartic acid, threonine, serine, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, cysteine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, lysine, histidine, arginine, and proline. With the exception of cysteine, all these amino acids were present in higher concentrations in plants inoculated with R. sphaeroides than in control plants or in plants inoculated with L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, inoculation with R. sphaeroides significantly increased the calcium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphate contents. Our results suggest that the use of R. sphaeroides, L. plantarum, and S. cerevisiae in agricultural fields can improve plant growth. Moreover, inoculation of cucumber plants with R. sphaeroides regulates plant functional metabolites, thereby promoting plant growth.",

In this study, Forty-three vegetable amaranth genotypes were evaluated to determine the status of total antioxidant content, polyphenol, flavonoid, antioxidant vitamins and minerals, dietary fiber, nutritional and agronomic traits and the magnitude of genetic diversity based on the contribution of those traits for meaningful grouping and proper utilization in future breeding program. The experiment was carried out in an open experimental field at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Bangladesh in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Multivariate (Principal component and cluster) analysis was done using numerical taxonomic techniques of Sneath, & Sokal. Four principal components contributed 98.61% of the variation. Biological yield and total antioxidant content was strongly associated with their related all agronomic traits. Total flavonoid content had a higher contribution to total antioxidant capacity compared to vitamin and mineral antioxidants. Contribution of antioxidant profile and agronomic traits was the highest in diversity of vegetable amaranth. Both high and low yielding genotypes had a high antioxidant profile. Therefore, high yielding genotypes (From cluster VI) could be used directly as high antioxidant profile varieties and low yielding genotypes as a source of donor parents in hybridization program. Cluster analysis grouped the genotypes into six clusters. The diverse genotypes in different clusters were identified. Genotypes with desirable genes of one cluster hybridized with promising genotypes of other diverge clusters could facilitate the accumulation of favorable genes in hybrids.Abbreviations: PCA: principal component analysis; PC: principal component; dw: dry weight; TFC: total flavonoid content; TAC: total antioxidant capacity; TPC: total polyphenol content; K: potassium; Ca: calcium; Mg: magnesium; Fe: iron; Mn: manganese; Cu: copper; Zn: zinc",

Therefore, a two-year field experiment was conucted under Pannonian climate conditions in eastern Austria to assess nitrogen (N) yield and N fixation of several winter faba bean varieties from different European countries as compared to a spring faba bean. Winter wheat was used as a reference crop for estimating atmospheric N fixation. Winter faba beans were susceptible to frost damage especially in the harder of the two winters. Winter faba bean varieties could not achieve a higher grain yield and a higher grain N yield than the spring faba bean but had a higher grain N concentration (except for one variety). Grain yield and grain N yield of faba beans were severely impaired by drought in one year (with a mean of varieties of 8.3 g N m−2, winter wheat: 6.4 g N m−2); in the other year, grain N yield of faba beans considerably surpassed that of winter wheat (with a mean of varieties of 21.5 g N m−2, winter wheat: 8.8 g N m−2). After harvest, faba beans left higher nitrate residues in the soil, especially in the subsoil, and higher amounts of N in above-ground residues compared to winter wheat. Faba beans showed high N fixation under optimum conditions (with a mean of varieties of 21.9 g N m−2) whereas drought considerably impaired N fixation (with a mean of varieties of 6.3 g N m−2; with no differences between autumn- and spring-sown faba beans). In conclusion, growing winter faba bean varieties in eastern Austria did not result in higher grain yield, grain N yield, and N fixation compared to growing a spring faba bean.",

Most of the herbicide treatments provided excellent weed control, and produced much higher net benefit than weedy or weed-free check. None of the herbicides caused significant phytotoxicity to rice plants.

Sequential application of Pretilachlor/safener just after seeding followed by Propanil/Thiobencarb at early growth stage also provided satisfactory results in terms of efficacy and economic return. Since manual weeding was not economic, herbicide rotation using the above chemicals may be recommended for effective weed management in aerobic rice.",

The first and foremost objective of the millennium development goals (MDGs) set in 2000 is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by the year 2015. Three years to the target date, plant–parasitic nematodes pose enormous threats to global food security, destroying at least 12.3% of global food production annually. This is estimated to be more than US$157 billion worldwide. Nematode diseases of crops are difficult to control because of the insidious nature of nematodes, and their diagnostic symptoms closely resemble that of other pathogens and abiotic diseases. In order to effectively combat nematodes pests, it is necessary to define the problem in order to correctly search for lasting management strategies. The food insecurity facing millions of people especially in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America is real. Finding lasting solution to this problem presents a daunting challenge for nematologists. The challenges of the future lies in increasing knowledge of nematodes and to use this knowledge in training, research and development (R&D) of new technologies, methods and strategies to be used in effective and sustainable control of the plant parasitic nematodes.",

Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of 54 rice accessions using 14 polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers to select unique parents for breeding. Data analysis was based on marker and population genetic parameters. The mean polymorphic information content (PIC) was 0.61 suggesting high polymorphisms for the selected SSR markers among the rice accessions. The population structure revealed a narrow genetic base with only two major sub-populations. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that only 30% of the variation was attributed to population differences while 47% and 23% were due to variation among individuals within populations and within individual variation, respectively. The genetic distance and identity among genotypes varied from 0.083 to 1.834 and 0.159 to 0.921, respectively. Dendrogram grouped the genotypes into three clusters with wide variation among the accessions. The study established the existence of considerable genetic diversity among the tested 54 accessions. The selected genetic resources will be useful resources for rice breeding in Tanzania or other African countries.",

Tall fescue is considered ‘moderately tolerant’ to salinity stress, but our study revealed a remarkable diversity among the tested varieties. Armani, Essential, Fatcat, and Starlett were found to reach the same final germination (>90%), irrespective of NaCl concentration up to 15 ds m−1 NaCl; Asterix and Meandre expressed lower germination under the highest salinity level (>75%); and final germination decreased in Eyecandy, Rhizing star, and Thomahawk gradually with increasing salinity (>55%). The main effect of increasing salinity was a delay in germination, and our study suggests that the recording of final germination, which is performed on day-14 in a standard germination test, should be postponed in order to understand the full effect of salinity on germination potential. Nonetheless, a delay in germination will affect turf quality negatively and hence there is good reason to test for salinity tolerance when choosing a variety for sowing on saline soil. Further, our findings indicate a future perspective for breeding for improved salinity tolerance in tall fescue by the identification of salinity-tolerant breeding lines or varieties.",

Compared with the monoculture, intercropping with S. nigrum increased the biomass of grape seedlings, but intercropping with the other three hyperaccumulator species decreased the grape seedling biomass. Intercropping with S. nigrum increased chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll contents in leaves of grape seedlings compared with the monoculture, whereas intercropping with the other three hyperaccumulator species showed either a decrease or no effect. Intercropping with hyperaccumulator plants had no significant effects on chlorophyll b and carotenoid contents in leaves of grape seedlings compared with the monoculture.

The neural model is build using various kinds of DCNN architecture, interpretation was made over the models based on the accuracy rate and the performance. The transfer learning approach is applied over the pest data set by fine-tuning the hyperparameters and the layers of the ResNet-50 model. By comparing the resultant value, the fine-tuned ResNet-50 model produced better accuracy of 95.012% among other models.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to present the current opportunities and constraints to sorghum production in Nigeria. A participatory rural appraisal (PRA) study was conducted in three selected sorghum growing zones in northern Nigeria involving 250 farmers. Socio-economic data were collected through surveys and focus group discussions. Sorghum was cultivated mainly by males (80%) who had grade 6-12 level of education (31.3%), with the productive age of 21-45 years (75.7%) and a household family size of below five members (52.3%). Low yielding landrace varieties such as Kaura (37.4%) and Fara-fara (29.3%) were the most widely cultivated types across the study zones due to their good grain quality. The major farmers' preferred traits from a sorghum variety were high yield, drought tolerance and Striga resistance. The study recommends integrated sorghum technology development incorporating the described preferences of the farmers for sustainable production and economic gains of the crop.",

An attempt was made to distinguish the effects of growth and nitrogen uptake by the catch crop from the effect of mineralization of its residues. It was found that growth and nitrogen uptake by catch crops could reduce the nitrogen supply to the succeeding carrot crop through pre-emptive competition, whereas mineralization of nitrogen from the catch crop residues increased the nitrogen supply to the carrot crop. Nitrogen uptake by the carrots was thus highest where catch crop residues were incorporated on plots where no catch crop had been grown. The effect of the mineralization was found mainly to influence topsoil mineral nitrogen contents and the early nitrogen uptake by carrots, whereas the effect of pre-emptive competition was to reduce subsoil mineral nitrogen content and the nitrogen uptake by carrots late in the growing season. The apparent recovery of catch crop nitrogen by carrots was between 8 and 33%.",

Barley was fertilized with 21 and 42 kg ha−1 y−1 P by placement technique. Ley was given P 42 and 84 kg ha−1 y−1, but split into two equal portions, by broadcasting. The mean losses of TP from the barley and ley were 1.2 and 1.6 kg ha−1 y−1, respectively. The PP losses (calculated as the difference between TP and DP) constituted 69% of the TP loss from barley, but only 35% of that from ley. In the case of barley, a considerable amount of PP was carried by drainage water. The mean DP losses were 0.4 kg ha−1 y−1 from barley and 1.0 kg ha−1 y−1 from ley. The higher DP loss from ley was due to both the higher fertilizer rate and the fertilizer broadcasting technique. During the second and third years of the experiment, fertilizer broadcasting on the ley plots was followed by high DP concentrations in surface runoff and drainage water. The peak DP concentrations in drainage water occurred soon after fertilizer broadcasting followed by only 7-15 mm of flow, indicating fast preferential movement of orthophosphate from the surface through the soil.",

The soil was a sandy clay loam Typic Kandiudults (Bungor Series).

All the mixtures of acidic P fertilizer and zeolite with urea significantly increased soil NH4 content but not NO3 content. The mixtures with acidic P fertilizer and zeolite also significantly increased soil-exchangeable Ca, K and Mg, and benefited the formation of NH4 over NH3 compared with urea without additives. The increase in soil-exchangeable cations, and temporary reduction of soil pH, might have impeded urea hydrolysis in the microsite immediately around the fertilizer. It could be possible to improve the efficiency of urea surface-applied to high value crops by addition of TSP and zeolite.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modelling of ecosystem processes often requires soil temperature as a driving variable. Since soil temperature measurements are seldom available for regional applications, they have to be estimated from standard meteorological data. The objective of this paper is to present a general, simple empirical approach for estimating daily depth profiles of soil temperature from air temperature and a surface cover index (LAI; leaf area index) mainly focusing on agricultural soils in cold temperate regions. Air and soil temperature data measured daily or every fifth day at one to six different depths were acquired from all meteorological stations in Sweden where such records are available. The stations cover latitudes from 55.65° to 68.42° N and mean annual air temperatures from +8.6 to −0.6 °C. The time series spanned between two and ten years. The soils at the stations cover a wide range of soil textures, including two organic soils. We calibrated the model first for each station and then for all stations together and the general parameterization only slightly decreased the goodness of fit. This general model then was applied to two treatments in a field experiment: bare soil and a winter rape crop. The parameters governing the influence of LAI on heat fluxes were optimized using this experiment. Finally, the model was validated using soil temperature data from two barley treatments differing in LAI taken from another field experiment. In general, the model predicted daily soil temperature profiles well. For all soils and depths at the meteorological stations, 95% of the simulated daily soil temperatures differed by less than 2.8 °C from measurements. The corresponding differences were somewhat higher for the validation data set (3.9 °C), but bias was still low. The model explained 95% of the variation in the validation data. Since no site-specific adjustments were made in the validation simulations, we conclude that the application of the general model presented here will result in good estimates of soil temperatures under cold temperate conditions. The very limited input requirements (only air temperature and LAI) that are easily obtainable from weather stations and from satellites make this model suitable for spatial applications at catchment or regional scales.",

The temperature of the upper soil profile is determined by the soil properties, climate conditions, and site location, and can be either too high or too low for the crop requirements. A proper selection of plastic mulch can be used to modify the root-zone temperature to improve crop growth and yield. Cucumber plants grown in the field were exposed to different soil temperatures in two growing seasons under colored plastic mulches. Field studies were conducted during two growing seasons. Eight colored plastic mulches were tested at each growing season against bare soil. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of plastic mulch on heat accumulation as soil degree-day (DDsoil), photosynthesis rate, and yield of cucumber crop. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with nine treatments (eight colors of plastic mulch plus bare soil as the control) and four replications. The colors of the plastic mulches were: white-on-black, blue, white, black, black embossed, silver-on-black, red, and brown. DDsoil and plant photosynthesis were positively correlated with total yield, suggesting that increases in cucumber yield are due in part to an increase in soil temperature and plant photosynthesis. In conclusion, plants grown under the different colored plastic mulches had similar yields, and most of those plants had higher yields than plants grown in bare soil. We suggest that plastic mulch is useful for farmers of cucumber crops but the specific color of plastic mulch must be determined in each specific region.",

Effects of irrigation regime and irrigation water salinity on bell pepper including yield, fruit number and quality, vegetative and root growth, evapotranspiration and water use efficiency were investigated in this study by conducting two different experiments. Six different salinity levels of irrigation water and four different irrigation regimes were used as treatments. Considering the results from irrigation water salinity experiment, it can be concluded that as soil salinity increases, water consumption, water use efficiency, yield and other vegetative growth parameters of bell pepper were decreased. A polynomial relationship between soil salinity and water consumption was observed. It was found that bell pepper is moderately sensitive to salinity with a 1.2 dS m−1 threshold and a 10.9% slope value. In the irrigation regime experiment, limited irrigation caused decreases in water consumption, yield and vegetative growth of bell pepper. Yield response factors were close in the cases of irrigation regime (1.50) and irrigation water salinity (1.40). Total soluble solids of bell pepper were increased due to both irrigation water salinity and water application rate but not dry matter ratio. Considerable water consumption decreases because of salinity were determined. Therefore, the effect of irrigation water salinity should be considered in irrigation management to prevent excess saline water application and to protect the environment.",

However, how straw incorporation affects mobility and plant uptake of heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) still remains unclear. The effect of straw incorporation on Cd solubility and uptake by rice was investigated in a pot experiment. A Cd-contaminated paddy soil was incorporated with wheat straw at different rates (0, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% w/w). Cd and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in soil solution sampled during the experiment and Cd content in rice plant at maturity stage were assessed for each treatment. The results showed that the straw incorporation decreased pH and increased DOC and soluble Cd in the soil solutions, while rice growth was significantly inhibited by straw incorporation. Straw incorporation enhanced the Cd uptake by rice from plant tissue Cd concentration of 15.41 mg kg−1 (without straw) to 45.1 mg kg−1 (at 1% incorporation rate). Cd accumulated in the rice plant increased by 120% compared to the control. The Cd uptake by rice showed a plateau response, which cannot be explained by soluble Cd alone. Inhibited rice growth at high straw incorporation might decrease Cd uptake. Thus, we conclude that straw incorporation in heavy metal-contaminated rice paddy soil should not be recommended to avoid heavy metal contamination through food chain.",

    "abstract": "Water scarcity in agriculture is becoming a major problem due to increasing demand from nonagricultural uses and intensive crop management on existing croplands to meet the needs of an expanding global population. Efficient use of the available irrigation water is therefore of important concern. Even though intensive research in the areas of crop physiology, irrigation engineering, agronomy and agricultural economics has developed several ways to improve the efficiency of irrigation water, a multidisciplinary approach is often regarded as the best future path to achieve further enhancements in meeting the forthcoming challenge of producing more and safety foods. Failure of irrigation production has profound effects on the welfare of all those employed in it and also their customers. Indeed, the scale of the industry is such that world food prices will be influenced by the overall performance of the irrigation farmers, but low food prices are essential to the welfare of the poorest people. The contribution of irrigation and water management to increased food production must come through both expansion of irrigation and improved management of existing water supplies. This review presents the past, current and future panorama of irrigation as a viable tool in ensuring food security on the globe. Considering past trends, this review empathizes that future irrigation technologies should be focused on providing the leadership and capacity to capture, develop and promote new irrigation practices and management systems to optimize production.",

    "abstract": "In Tigray, Ethiopia, land degradation is a dominant environmental problem and hence the regional government has undertaken restoration measures on degraded soils since 1991. The present study was aimed to assess the impact of land uses and soil management practices on soil properties, and consequently on soil quality of degraded soils. The catchments selected were Maileba and Gum Selassa, and land uses included cultivated (CL), grazing (GL), plantation (PA) and area exclosure (AE). Replicated soil samples were collected from topsoil and profiles of four land-use types in both catchments. Soils in area exclosure showed higher soil organic carbon (SOC), total N and extractable K than grazing land, cultivated land and plantation area mainly at 0–40 cm soil depth. Estimated soil organic carbon stock at Maileba in 0–40 cm depth varied between 54 to 74 Mg C ha−1, being lowest in cultivated land and highest in area exclosure, and the soil organic carbon stock in area exclosure represents 63% of total carbon stock stored in the profile. Soil organic carbon stock (0–40 cm) at Gum Selassa ranged between 33 to 38 Mg C ha−1, being higher in cultivated land and lower in plantation area. Soil quality index (SQI) of area exclosure (0.794) at Maileba and cultivated land (0.721) at Gum Selassa scored highest among all land uses, and the order was area exclosure>grazing land>plantation area>cultivated land at Maileba and cultivated land>grazing land>plantation area at Gum Selassa, highlighting the effectiveness of area exclosure in restoring soil quality of degraded soils.",

    "abstract": "Two field experiments with drained plots on clay soils (60% and 25% clay) demonstrated a significant reduction in leaching of total phosphorus after application of structure lime. Aggregate stability was significantly improved. Phosphorus leaching in particulate form was significantly reduced following structure liming at the site with a very high clay content. Sites representing low (50 mg kg−1) and high (140 mg kg−1) levels of phosphorus extractable with acid ammonium lactate in topsoil displayed differing effects on leaching of dissolved reactive P (DRP). This form of phosphorus was only significantly reduced compared with the control at one site with high topsoil phosphorus status and relatively high (17–18%) degree of phosphorus saturation in the subsoil. Laboratory experiments with simulated rain events applied to topsoil lysimeters from the same site also demonstrated a significant reduction in leaching of DRP. These findings indicate that structure liming is an appropriate leaching mitigation measure on soils with both a high clay content and high soil phosphorus status.",

    "abstract": "The scarcity of fresh water has forced farmers to use saline water (SW) for irrigation. It is important to understand the response of the soil microbial community and diversity to saline irrigation water. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of irrigation water salinity and nitrogen fertilization rates on soil physicochemical properties, microbial activity, microbial biomass, and microbial functional diversity. The field experiment consisted of a factorial design with three levels of irrigation water salinity (electrical conductivities (ECs) of 0.35, 4.61 or 8.04 dS m−1) and two nitrogen rates (0 and 360 kg N ha−1). The results showed that the 4.61 and 8.04 dS m−1 treatments both reduced soil microbial biomass C (MBC), microbial biomass N (MBN), basal respiration, total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), bacterial PLFA, fungal PLFA, and fungal:bacterial ratios. In contrast, the SW treatments increased the MBC:MBN ratio. Nitrogen fertilization increased soil MBC, MBN, basal respiration, total PLFA, bacterial PLFA, and gram-negative bacterial PLFA. In contrast, N fertilization decreased gram-positive bacterial PLFA, fungal PLFA, and fungal:bacterial ratios. Average well color development, Richness, and Shannon's Index were always lowest in the 8.04 dS m−1 treatment. Carbon utilization patterns in the 8.04 dS m−1 treatment were different from those in the 0.35 dS m−1 treatment. In conclusion, five years of irrigation with brackish or SW reduced the soil microbial biomass, activity, and functional diversity, which may cause the deterioration of soil quality. Thus, the high-salinity water (EC > 4.61 dS m−1) is not appropriate as a single irrigation water resource. Proper N fertilizer input may overcome some of the negative effects of salinity on soil microbial.",

It is confirmed that the combination of red and blue LED lights shows good performance on plant growth and development. Based on the hydroponic culture system in plant production factory, selection of a suitable nutrient solution for specific crop would be very important. In this study, four different widely used nutrient solutions (Hoagland, Garden-style, Yamasaki, and SCAU) were tested in perlite culture cucumber seedlings during 40-day growth under 2:1 ratio of LED lights with 12 h photoperiod at 100 ± 5 μmol m−2s−1 irradiance. The plant growth, morphology, pigments, biomass, photosynthetic characteristics, and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) content were measured. Cucumber seedlings treated with formula SCAU showed weak appearance, less biomass, and reduced photosynthetic activity compared with those supplied with Hoagland. However, the differences between formulae Garden-style and Yamasaki were not obvious, but both of them showed significantly higher plant height, leaf area, total leaf number, and shoot N content compared to SCAU. It is concluded that formula Hoagland shows better performance regarding cucumber seedling growth under LED light.",

    "abstract": "Sensor technology represents a relatively novel opportunity for water quality monitoring, and some of its many potential uses have been explored and assessed in this paper. Four Norwegian case studies with sensor recordings of turbidity, pH, conductivity and water level have been used for this assessment. The cases have included rivers, creeks and storm water overflow systems, with both point- and non-point sources of pollution from different types of land use including agriculture, road construction works, road salt application and acidic bedrocks. The results indicated that: (1) good correlations were found between sensor-based turbidity data and concentrations of both suspended particulate matter and phosphorus in grab samples from a small agricultural stream; (2) sensor recordings of turbidity proved superior to both fortnightly grab sampling and time-integrated composite sampling in terms of detecting high values of suspended sediments from both diffuse and point sources. However, the calculation of average concentrations based on fortnightly grab samples and sensor data gave almost similar results; (3) at a road construction site, the use of equipment with multiple sensors revealed that anticipated cause and effect relationships between fish deaths and high sediment loads could not be detected, but episodes of low pH of 5–5.5 did occur during rainstorms, probably as a result of weathering of acidic bedrock; and (4) in an urban road system subject to salt application in the wintertime, sensor technology revealed short-term peaks of salinity, on occasions as high as for sea water. Overall, these findings have demonstrated the usefulness of sensor data compared to traditional methods, in particular due to the possibility of high-frequency recordings of several parameters in systems with rapid changes in water quality.",

    "abstract": "Responsive fertilisation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is often adopted, with N applied two or three times between the developmental stages of tillering and booting. Satellite-based decision support systems (DSS) providing vegetation index maps calculated from satellite data are available to aid farmers in adjusting the topdressing nitrogen (N) rate site-specifically to the current season and to variations in growth conditions within the field. One example is the freely available CropSAT DSS used in Scandinavia, which provides farmers with raster maps of the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2) calculated mainly from data obtained from satellites Sentinel-2 (ESA, EU) and DMC (DMCii Ltd, Guildford, UK). This study investigated the possibility of calibrating MSAVI2 maps with data from handheld proximal sensor measurements of N uptake covering the main agricultural regions in Sweden during growth stages Z30-45 on the Zadok scale, in order to facilitate farmers' decisions on N rate. More than 200 N-sensor measurements acquired during 2015 and 2016 in seven different winter wheat cultivars were combined with MSAVI2 values from CropSAT. It was found that N uptake could be predicted in a general, national model, i.e. for sites and dates other than those for which the calibration model was parameterised, with a mean absolute error of 11–15 kg N ha−1. A cultivar-specific model performed better than this general model, but a regional model showed no improvement compared with the model parameterised with national data. Vegetation indices calculated from the two narrow bands of Sentinel-2 in the red edge-near infrared region of the crop canopy reflectance spectrum proved to be promising alternatives to the broadband index MSAVI2. Based on the results, we suggest that data from a monitoring programme involving handheld N sensor measurements can be integrated with a satellite-based DSS to upscale N uptake information.",

    "abstract": "Temperature plays a crucial role in plants development whereas a sudden rise may cause severe consequences. Heat stress impairs plant growth, photosynthesis, pollen development and reproduction. The plant photosynthetic efficiency is mainly reduced by the over production of reactive oxygen species, denaturation of heat shock proteins and alteration in many enzymes activities. Unlike drought stress, plants have developed a very few mechanisms to encounter heat stress problem. Recently, the use of nutrients such as sulphur has emerged as one of the efficient methods to enhance plant tolerance against high temperature stress. The mechanistic understanding of sulphur-based strategies could be very helpful to sustain plant development and global food supplies in future hotter climates. The present review mainly focuses on (1) high temperature induced changes in plant functions, (2) possible roles of sulphur metabolites in heat stress tolerance and (3) possibilities of using sulphur as a management strategy. Moreover, the review consolidates the future research needs that must focus on (i) heat tolerant germplasm screening; (ii) sulphur dose optimisation, application method and crop growth stages response; (iii) finding of sulphur induced heat tolerance mechanisms and (iv) the use of omic approaches to discover sulphur metabolites role in heat stress tolerance.",

Both Se foliar- and soil-fertilisation increased the Se concentration in grains from 2.6- to 4.6-fold. The concentration in grain was highest with Se foliar-fertilisation of 10 g ha−1 and it was increased by 29–32 µg Se kg−1 dry weight for each gram of Se applied per ha. The wheat cultivars differed in grain yield and Se uptake (g ha−1 Se). However, on average, there were no differences between wheat cultivars with respect to Se grain concentrations. Agronomic use efficiency (by grain) was significantly higher for Se foliar- (19%) than for soil-fertilisation (13%). It can be concluded that agronomic biofortification of winter wheat can be effective in increasing Se grain concentration, where the efficiency depends on the rate of Se applied, application method and local environmental conditions rather than on cultivar differences.",

Drought in the flowering phase or in the pod-filling phase or throughout the seasons was partly combined with three nitrogen levels of 200, 100 and 0 kg N ha−1. During the dry years 1992 and 1993, at 200 kg N ha−1, seed yield, pod number and seeds per pod were strongly decreased by drought, whereas the seed weight increased after drought during flowering. The straw yield was less affected by drought. Lower nitrogen levels reduced seed yield in the fully irrigated treatments; in the unirrigated treatments, however, the yield was slightly higher at the 0 N and 100 N level than at 200 N in both 1992 and 1993. Nitrogen and drought increased the nitrogen concentration of the seeds and decreased the oil concentration. The interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was estimated from spectral reflectance ratio measurements. The dry-matter: radiation quotient (∊t) for top biomass growth was 2.38 g MJ−1 when growth was not limited by drought. Prolonged drought stress reduced both interception of PAR and ∊1 to the same degree. ∊t was little affected by lower nitrogen levels, which mainly reduced the interception of PAR. Seed yield was linearly related to PAR intercepted during the pod-filling phase with an apparent seed dry matter: radiation quotient of 2.47 g MJ−1. However, in treatments severely drought stressed in the flowering phase, up to 65% of the assimilates produced during pod filling ended up in the straw fraction, because the sink size of the seeds was limited.",

Large declines were found in most cases at the research farm, especially for soils with high initial levels of SOM. The declines between 1952 and 1976 were thought to be partly due to increased depth of ploughing and improved drainage, while those in the latter period may in part be related to climatic change. Declines were also found since 1990 in the majority of the arable fields sampled, and the declines were proportional to the initial SOM level in this case also. No single causative factor was isolated for these declines, but the proportions of autumn tillage and of row crops in the rotation may be involved. A mean relative decline rate of around 1% per year of the initial SOM level was observed both at the research farm and in the arable fields. There was, however, also an indication that the percentage relative decline rate was proportional to one-tenth of the initial SOM. These two alternative scenarios suggest that soils with current SOM levels of 4%, 6% and 10%, will reach a possibly 'critical' level of 3% in 30–80, 70–165 and 120–230 years time, respectively.",

Perennial herbaceous grasses can play an important role in this capacity. They contribute a number of desirable attributes to cropping systems such as limiting soil erosion, improving water quality, having lower agricultural chemical and nutrient requirements, and increasing the organic matter content of the soil. In this review the properties of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), one of the highest-yielding cool-season grasses, are discussed with regard to its potential use as a biofuel. Higher yields of reed canarygrass are attainable since more productive accessions have been identified in breeding programs. Furthermore, biofuel quality may be improved through the selection of genotypes with relatively high cell-wall content. However, the high ash content of reed canarygrass remains a challenge, as does its invasiveness as a weed in certain regions of North America. Strategies that can be employed to lower the ash content of reed canarygrass are considered.",

The objectives of this study were to predict the biomass, grain yield, and grain protein in wheat grown in hilly regions using an artificial neural network model and to identify the most important topographic attributes and soil properties affecting the variability of the wheat-yield components under rainfed conditions in the semiarid and hilly regions of western Iran. Wheat-yield data and surface-soil samples (0–30 cm depth) were collected from 1-m2 plots at 100 selected points. The sampling points were chosen in a stratified random manner on given geomorphic surfaces including summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope, and toeslope at the site. Primary and secondary terrain attributes were calculated using the digital elevation model. Selected soil physical and chemical properties were measured for the collected soil samples. Prediction of the artificial neural network models in the study area resulted in R 2 and root mean square error values of 0.95 and 0.022 for biomass, 0.93 and 0.021 for grain yield, and 0.89 and 0.063 for grain protein, respectively. The sediment-transport index was identified as the most important topographic attribute influencing the wheat biomass, while grain yield and grain protein were affected the most by the total nitrogen. Overall, our results indicated that the artificial neural network models could explain 89–95% of the total variability in wheat biomass, grain yield, and grain protein content. Also, the predictability of wheat yield and quality could be further improved by considering management practices followed during the growing season.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the extractability of cadmium (Cd) and Cd uptake by rice after applying soil amendments of lime (Ca(OH)2) and sepiolite. A rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation experiment was conducted in a Cd-contaminated paddy field. After applying lime, sepiolite, and a mixture of the two as soil amendments, soil pH showed a significant increase (p<0.05), and Cd in soil extracted with NaNO3, CaCl2, and DTPA, was reduced by 61–100%, 52–98%, and 12–15%, respectively (p<0.05). The amount of exchangeable Cd showed a significant decrease in all treatments (p<0.05), and we found increases in the proportion of forms of carbonate-bound, Fe/Mn oxide-bound, and residual Cd in the soils, as measured by a sequential extraction method. The grain or rice straw biomass was neither significantly influenced by any amendment in the experiment, while the uptake of Cd by rice significantly decreased in all treatments (p<0.05). The results reveal no advantage in applying a mixture of sepiolite and lime compared with applying sepiolite alone in immobilizing Cd in the soil. The use of sepiolite or sepiolite mixed with lime was more effective than the use of lime alone in the immobilization of Cd in the soil. We therefore recommend sepiolite as a soil amendment to remediate Cd-contaminated paddy soil.",

An autotetraploid indica/japonica hybrid combines the advantages of polyploidy and heterosis between indica and japonica and seems to have stronger potential vigor in rice breeding than diploid rice does. In the present experiment it was revealed that traits like panicle length, number of grains per panicle, and grain length seemed to be predominantly influenced by an additive type of gene action, while remaining traits were found to be influenced by non-additive genetic effects. Diploid material represented greater negative genetic effects as compared with autotetraploid material except for grain length and seed-setting rate for which both types of plant material preformed equivalently. Genotypic environment interaction effects were also more pronounced in diploid rice hybrids as compared with their autotetraploid counterparts. Autotetraploid hybrids demonstrated highly significant heterosis over a better parent for most traits as compared with diploid hybrids. Autotetraploid plant materials studied here may be adaptable to various locations for yield trait. Also, the autotetraploid cross-combination Guanglu'ai 4×Jackson may be utilized in autotetraploid rice hybrid breeding owing to its better performance over that of others. The idea of better performance of polyploids over diploids might come to be true after consideration of research findings compiled in the present research.",

    "abstract": "Many believe that conservation tillage practices could increase the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide into agricultural soils and this sequestered carbon may partially offset the greenhouse gas effect and thus reduce the impact of global warming. Recent advances in soil carbon (C) and greenhouse gas analysis have made it possible to evaluate the impacts of conservation tillage on C sequestration from various perspectives. Although conservation tillage favors soil and water conservation, there are biased estimates of C sequestration associated with conservation tillage, and it is particularly an issue for a \"pure\" no-tillage (NT) system. Accordingly, this paper presents an overview of the progress achieved in evaluating C sequestration in no-till (the extreme type of conservation tillage) and conventional tillage production systems. In addition to extended discussion of how soil sampling and calculations could influence the estimates of C gains or losses in no-till versus conventional tilled soil, this review will also focus on following aspects, including (1) the impact of NT on crop yields which governs organic C inputs to soil from crop residue, (2) the impact of NT on soil organic C mineralization which is a major pathway of soil C output, and (3) the roles of the initial levels of C stocks and soil erosion rates which are crucial for estimating soil C sequestration under different tillage systems. Many soil C studies have indicated that the impacts of NT on soil C sequestration are compounded by many factors and should not be generalized.",

Four types of commercial SAPs with organic macromolecules, labeled BF, JP, BJ, and WT, were taken with the aim of determining water-absorption capacity under different conditions, such as distilled water, tap water, soil extraction as the mixture of distilled water and soil, soil extraction as the mixture of tap water and soil, different temperatures, and varying soil drying degrees. After five absorption processes, the repeated water absorbencies in tap water, mixture of distilled water and soil, and mixture of tap water and soil were reduced by 73.4–99.3% relative to those in distilled water. Moreover, water quality had a greater effect on original water absorbency than soil extractions. Water absorbency increased with SAP's concentration, and such increases were reduced with repeated utilization. No significant differences in repeated water absorbency were found with varying temperatures (50, 25, and −4°C). SAPs maintained excellent hydrophilic capacity for an extended period when the drying degrees of hydrogels were less than or equal to 80%. JP was initially considered to best sustain water absorption, followed by WT and BF. BJ showed the least absorption. The performances in repeated usage varied according to absorption stability, gel structure, application concentration of the SAPs, water quality, and soil moisture. Farmers can be recommended to use macromolecules JP and WT to improve crop production under altering dry–wet conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Winters are typically harsh in the northernmost agricultural areas of Europe, and winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are the only winter grain crops that can be grown. However, climate change is projected to result in milder winters, which may enable cultivation of winter crops to a greater extent in the future than is possible today. In this study we aimed at identifying main temperature, precipitation events and characteristics that have resulted in past poor overwintering of rye and wheat in their current production areas in Finland. Using long-term (1970–2006), multi-location datasets, we compared our findings with the projected major changes attributable to climate change. Mixed models were used to estimate mutually comparable overwintering damage to all experiments and logistic regression was used to determine whether climatic parameters are related to high levels of overwintering damage. Severity of overwintering damage, and associated yield penalties, fluctuate considerably on a year-to-year basis and no consistent reduction in variability was recorded during the study period. Particularly for wheat, severity of winter damage in any one year was associated negatively with area sown in the following year. There was no evidence of consistent genetic improvements in winter hardiness, but rye was more winter hardy than wheat. Current risks associated with rye production related to low temperatures could be alleviated in the future, although overwintering damage currently enhanced by high autumn precipitation could increase due to climate change. For wheat, fluctuating conditions hampered overwintering, which may be an even harder challenge in future when weather variation is projected to increase and extreme weather events are projected to become more common.",

    "abstract": "Development of organic fertilizers using microbial extracts is an emerging method in organic farming. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the bioactive substances in a plant growth-promoting bacterial culture, intended to enhance the growth of oriental melons (Cucumis melo L.). LKE15 was isolated from oriental melon rhizosphere soil and identified as Bacillus sp. LKE15 through 16S rDNA sequencing of the bacterial genomic DNA and a subsequent phylogenetic analysis. Bacillus sp. LKE15 was found to enhance the shoot length, fresh weight, dry weight, and chlorophyll content of both dwarf rice (gibberellins [GAs]-deficient mutant, waito-C) and normal rice (active GAs biosynthesis, Hwayoungbyeo) cultivars, as compared to their controls. The presence of bioactive metabolites such as GAs (GA4, GA9, and GA34), indole-3-acetic acid, and high concentrations of phosphate in the bacterial culture filtrate (CF) significantly promote host plant growth. The plant growth-stimulating effect of CF was confirmed by the increased shoot length, root length, and plant fresh weight of oriental melon as compared to the controls. Similarly, Bacillus sp. LKE15 inoculation also enhanced plant growth but at a lower rate than CF. The increased synthesis of chlorophyll and individual amino acids and their derivatives, including taurine, aspartic acid, threonine, serine, glycine, alanine, citrulline, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, β-alanine, γ-amino-n-butyric acid, ethanolamine, 1-methylhistidine, and hydroxyproline in CF-treated plants reflected a significant increase in the growth of treated plants, as compared to the control. However, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus contents were significantly enhanced in plants treated with CF. Results of this study suggest that the availability of bioactive metabolites in the CF of Bacillus sp. LKE15 stimulates plant growth, and that treatment with the CF of Bacillus sp. LKE15 would be a useful tool for the organic farming of crop plants.",

    "abstract": "Potato is one of the most important crops in the world because of its high nutritional value; however, traditional cultivation in bare soil may render low yields and poor quality. Crop production efficiency can be increased by using plastic mulching and row covers to modify root zone temperature and plant growth, in addition to reduction in pest damage and enhance production in cultivated plants. However, there is little information demonstrating the effect of row covers in combination with plastic mulch on potato. The aim of this study was to assess the change in root zone temperature and its effect on growth, leaf nutrient, and yield of potato using plastic mulch of different colors, in combination with row covers. Seed of cultivar Mondial was planted in May 2012. The study included four plastic films: black, white/black, silver/black, aluminum/black, and a control with bare soil, which were evaluated alone and in combination with row covers removed at 30 days after sowing in a split-plot design. Higher yields were obtained when no row cover (43.2 t ha−1) and the white/black film (42.2 t ha−1) were used. Leaf nitrogen, sulfur, and manganese concentration were higher in plants when row cover was used; in contrast, no–row cover plants were higher in Fe and Zn. Mulched plants were higher in Mn concentration than control plants. There was a quadratic relationship between mean soil temperature and total yield (R2 = 0.94), and between plant biomass and total yield (R2 = 0.98), between leaf area with total yield (R2 = 0.98).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Locally produced crop protein is urgently needed in Europe. Pea is a good protein source and is well adapted to northern conditions. Pea can fix nitrogen that the following crop in rotation can benefit from. In cereal-dominated cropping systems pea is a break crop disrupting the life cycle of cereal diseases, leading to less fungicide application and thereby minimizing off farm inputs and benefiting the environment. Grain legumes provide animals with protein and energy, and the seeds of pulse crops are complementary to those of cereals. Field peas can be cultivated in most parts of Scandinavia and interest in peas has increased for inclusion in organic farming. Growing pea as a sole crop is a challenge since its stem is prone to lodging thereby resulting in harvesting difficulties, reduced yield and decreased profits. Intercropping of pea with oat could minimize the above listed problems but to our knowledge proportion of seeds mixture of the two crops and selection of pea cultivars without compromising the pea yield, especially protein production, at high latitudes conditions is limited. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate performance of sole cropped pea (Karita, Perttu, Hulda) and oat (seed proportions 7.5% and 15%) and their intercrop combinations and establish an appropriate seed mixture for a pea–oat intercropping systems that prevents lodging without markedly reducing pea yield. Field experiments were conducted at three locations (Jokioinen, Mietoinen, Ylistaro) of the Agrifood Research Finland in 2002–2004. Intercropping peas with oats prevented peas from lodging and made their harvest easier. Optimal numbers of oats in pea intercrops were difficult to determine, varying according to pea cultivar and local growth conditions. Excess oats in the seed mixture or conditions favouring oat growth prevented peas from lodging but pea yield was decreased.",

    "abstract": "In the mountainous rangeland of inland arid regions of Eurasia, seasonal grazing has been important to local communities for production of food, fiber, and for income, for the past thousand years. Recent population increases and other changes have put traditional grazing systems under pressure. However, empirical data describing soil properties or the impact of traditional grazing practice on the thresholds at which increase in animal stocking rate (SR) may result in degradation are lacking. Here, we provide, for alpine \"typical steppe\" at Qilian Mountain on the Tibetan plateau in China, a description of variation in some soil properties with soil depth, and with variation in grazing intensity. The soils studied have a humus-rich epipedon typically exceeding our sampling depth of 40 cm. As commonly reported, increased grazing intensity has correlated with depletion in soil organic carbon (SOC). Regression of our SOC data on SR indicated no \"safe\" threshold for grazing intensity below which SOC depletion would not occur. Other soil changes linked to increased grazing intensity in our study included a lowering of the carbon:nitrogen ratio (indicating possibly increased risk of nitrogen loss from farming systems to the wider environment), an increase in soil bulk density, a decrease in soil moisture content, and transfer of phosphorus from less intensively grazed areas toward animal night pens. Our study site is experiencing a climate warming trend which may be contributing to loss of SOC.",

We chose treatments without nitrogen (N) and high N fertilizer addition in two crop rotations with and without ley and farmyard manure application. The soil properties measured included soil organic matter, microbial composition, aggregate stability, readily dispersible clay and micronutrient content in topsoil (0–30 cm) and upper subsoil (30–40 cm). Studies of two adjacent soil profiles revealed that the upper subsoil of an N-fertilized treatment had more soil organic matter, darker colour, more aggregation, more fine roots and was 10 cm thicker than that of the no-N treatment. This pronounced subsoil development in treatments with higher yields (high N input) was corroborated by carbon mass determinations based on systematic sampling including bulk density. Soil organic matter contents were higher in N-fertilized than unfertilized treatments, either with or without manure. Nitrogen fertilization caused distinct differences in microbial composition at one study site. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis revealed: (1) that mineral N fertilizer promoted nitrifiers; and (2) that bacteria were favoured over fungi in treatments with N supply probably due to nitrogen-rich crop residues. Soil aggregate stability (water dispersion) was correlated to soil organic matter and clay content. We also tested the hypothesis whether trace element contents in the top- and subsoil were affected by N fertilization through removal by large yields. Despite long-term depletion, crop removal of micronutrients was too small to cause significant differences in soil between treatments.",

Therefore, a two-year experiment was conducted under Pannonian growing conditions in Eastern Austria to investigate the effect of autumn- and spring-sowing of facultative wheat. Autumn-sowing of facultative wheat enhanced crop development, soil coverage, crop stand height, crop growth rate, and nitrogen (N) utilization efficiency during the vegetation period compared to spring-sowing; duration of growth stages was prolonged and crops were earlier ripe. In contrast, spring-sowing resulted in higher relative growth rates, higher N concentrations of aboveground dry matter, higher relative N uptake rates, and more mineral N in the soil. At harvest, grain yield and yield components ears m−2 and thousand kernel weight (TKW) were higher in autumn-sown than in spring-sown wheat, resulting thereby in an increased seed yield. Spring-sown wheat had higher N concentrations in grain and in straw. Anyhow, N yield was slightly higher with autumn-sowing due to the higher grain and straw yields. Grain and straw yield, plant stand height, ears m−2, and TKW were impaired in the second experimental year by a severe drought for both sowing dates as well as N concentrations and N yields of grain and straw, partial factor N use efficiency and N utilization efficiency. But the yield components harvest index, grains m−2, and grains ear−1 were strongly impaired with spring-sowing under drought conditions. Thus, autumn-sowing of wheat resulted in higher yield stability across both years, based on these yield components highlighting possible benefits of autumn-sowing with expected summer drought under climate change.",

Soil samples from 0–20, 20–40 and 40–60 cm depth were collected from three land uses: pasture, forest, and adjacently located arable land at different altitude (ranging from 2100–4163 m). The variables investigated were soil bulk density (BD), soil organic carbon concentration (SOC), soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) and pH. A significant variation in all tested variables were found across the land uses and altitudes. Likewise, soil under forest had significantly higher values of SOCS (59.35 Mg ha−1) than pasture (42.48 Mg ha−1) and arable land (23.63 Mg ha−1). Similarly, SOCS increased with increasing altitude and decreased with soil depth in all land uses. In addition, SOCS had a negative relationship with BD and pH. Overall results indicated that the land use intensification and climate change (increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation) were associated with declining SOCS. These results suggest restoration of degraded agricultural land to the forest, especially at higher altitude, and decrease in intensity of land use could increase SOCS in the study area as well as other similar mountainous regions.",

Drought stress was imposed at the four-leaf stage for 10 days (30–35% field capacity). Dehydration of maize leaves was accompanied by the accumulation of both total soluble and cell wall-bound phenolics, reduction in leaf relative water content (LRWC), and shoot and root growth attributes. Foliar spraying of SA further augmented the content of total soluble and cell wall-bound phenolics and total soluble proteins content under drought stress. SA ameliorated the adverse effects of drought stress on LRWC, shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root fresh weight, root dry weight, root length and root area. The accumulation of both soluble and cell wall-bound phenolics by foliar spray of SA may be a mechanism related to SA-induced drought stress tolerance in maize. It was concluded that foliar spraying of SA at 10−5 mol/L can be highly economical and effective for modifying the effects of drought stress on maize at the four-leaf stage.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge on farmers' perspectives is of paramount importance in order to design appropriate agricultural research and development interventions attuned to local farming systems. A participatory rural appraisal was conducted in order to understand perceived causes and indicators of soil acidity under multiple land-uses in three Districts of northwest Ethiopia. Soil samples were also collected from five dominant land-uses. The samples were analysed for soil pH, exchangeable acidity and other physico-chemical properties. The result indicated that the pH(H2O) of most of the soils in the study sites were in a strongly acidic range (4.6–5.5). Gashena Akayita of the Banja District was the most acidic of all. Among the land-uses, eucalyptus fields were the most acidic followed by crop outfields and grazing lands in that order. At all the study sites, exchangeable Al was detected in soils having a pH of less than 5.0. Overall, the nutrient dynamics showed variation across land-uses and study sites. Farmers' perceived causes of soil acidity included: soil erosion; contending use of fertility replenishing local resources; abandoning traditional fertility management practices and minimal use of external inputs. The farmers attributed the exclusive use of acid-forming inorganic fertilizers to exhaustion of the soil. Various land and soil characteristics, plant growth attributes, changes in genetic diversity were mentioned as indicators of soil acidity. Particularly, the farmers used prevalence of acidophilic weed species on crop fields and grazing lands as marker of strongly acidic soil. Farmers' perceived causes and indicators were in agreement with scientific facts and can be utilized as input in designing sustainable acid soil management strategies. Decline in genetic diversity of the once widespread crop species and land races, and expansion of newly introduced soil acidity tolerant species, suggests the need to undertake rescue collections in these areas.",

    "abstract": "Application of sewage sludge on agricultural land becomes more and more common in many parts of the world in order to recycle the nutrients from the sludge. A range of sewage sludge stabilization techniques are available to make the sludge more stable prior to storage, transportation, and application. These stabilization techniques include dewatering, drying, anaerobic digestion, composting, and reed bed sludge treatment. However, very few studies have investigated the effect of these techniques after the sludge has been applied to agricultural land. The objective of the current study was therefore to investigate the effect of sewage sludge stabilization techniques on the C and N mineralization and gaseous emissions from soil. A soil incubation was conducted to determine the rate of C and N mineralization and N2O and CH4 emissions of sewage sludge stabilized using different techniques. Unstabilized sludge released up to 90% of their C content as CO2, part of which could be caused by release of CO2 from carbonates. Compared with this, sludge stabilization including anaerobic digestion and drying resulted in a reduction of the C mineralization rate of about 40%. Liming reduced C mineralization with around 29%, while treatment in a reed bed system reduced it by 74%. The current study thus clearly demonstrated that stabilization techniques resulted in sludge that was more stable once they were applied to agricultural land. Stabilization also reduced the N immobilization phase, potentially improving the value of the sludge as a fertilizer. Emissions of CH4 were also reduced through sludge stabilization and mainly occurred after application of easily degradable sludge types, which is likely to have enhanced the creation of anaerobic microsites. The stabilization processes also decreased emissions of N2O. The results for both CH4 and N2O indicate that the stabilization tends to reduce the chance of developing conditions where these gases could be produced.",

Faba bean exhibited a high ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, as indicated by the percentage of N2 derived from the atmosphere which exceeded 75% in all evaluated varieties, and the total amount of biologically fixed N up to full anthesis, which fluctuated from 118.5 to 193.9 kg ha−1 in the various cropping systems and cultivars. The weed density was appreciably higher in the organic plots, without significant differences among the faba bean cultivars, while wild mustard and corn poppy were the most competitive weeds. The application of inorganic starter fertiliser in the conventionally-treated plots had no negative effect on biologically-fixed nitrogen by faba bean plants, while the herbicide pendimethalin had no negative impact on the nodulation process. Protein concentrations in faba bean cultivars fluctuated from 27.3% to 31.4%. The evaluated landraces could be utilised in breeding programmes due to their earliness, and their high performance in terms of protein content, BNF ability, and productivity.",

In SSA, the potential of sorghum production and productivity has not been realised due to an array of constraints. Colletotrichum sublineolum disease is one of the main biotic constraints causing significant yield losses. The objectives of this study were to assess farmers' perception, preferences and constraints to sorghum production and productivity in western Ethiopia, and to identify key drivers for anthracnose resistance breeding. A participatory rural appraisal study was undertaken in six selected districts in the East Wellega and West Shewa Administrative Zones in Ethiopia. Data were collected through structured questionnaires involving 165 respondent farmers. Further focus group discussions were held with 180 farmers and development agents. Sorghum is the third most preferred cereal crop after Eragrostis tef and Zea mays in western Ethiopia. About 79% of interviewed farmers cultivated sorghum during the study season. Farmers perceived that sorghum production is constrained by anthracnose disease, bird attack, loose smut and covered smut diseases. The most important farmer-preferred traits in sorghum varieties in the study areas were anthracnose resistance and tolerance to bird attack. Breeding sorghum varieties with the farmer-preferred traits is an important consideration to enhance productivity and adoption of improved sorghum cultivars in western Ethiopia.",

Soil strength was assessed by laboratory measurements of the precompression stress in topsoil (20 cm) and subsoil (40 and 60 cm) samples. Stress propagation, as well as elastic and plastic deformation during wheeling were measured in the field with combined stress state (SST) and displacement transducers (DTS). We also present results from soil physical analyses (bulk density, air capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity) and barley yields from the first two years after the compaction. Although the wheel loads used were comparatively small, typical for the machinery used in Norway, the results show that both increased wheel load and wheeling intensity had negative effects on soil physical parameters especially in the topsoil but with similar tendencies also in the subsoil. Stress propagation was detected down to 60 cm depth (SST). The first wheeling was most harmful, but all wheelings led to accumulative plastic soil deformation (DTS). Under the workable conditions in this trial, increased wheeling with a small machine was more harmful to soil structure than a single wheeling with a heavier machine. However, the yields in the first two years after the compaction did not show any negative effect of the compaction.",

Hydrothermal carbonisation is a technology that transforms the sludge into a hydrochar. The objective of this study is examining P availability of two hydrochars produced from Danish and Irish dairy sludge and their influence on greenhouse gas emissions and maize yields. The trial assessed (i) Danish dairy sludge; (ii) hydrochar derived from Danish sludge; (iii) hydrochar made from Irish dairy sludge; (iv) mineral phosphorus fertiliser; and (v) control. Emissions of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, soil pH, mineral nitrogen contents and crop yields were measured. Treatment with Danish dairy sludge had significantly higher cumulative nitrous oxide emissions while the emissions from both hydrochars were not significantly different compared to mineral phosphorous feriliser. Statistical modelling showed that temperature, soil nitrate content, interactions both between temperature and precipitation, and between soil moisture and precipitation were drivers for nitrous oxide emissions. There was no difference in emissions among all treatments when scaled for yield. Hydrochar may alleviate the enhanced nitrous oxide emissions in soil without constraining P availability and maize crop yields.",

In an untreated state the four barley cultivars did not show differences with regard to aphid acceptance. However, after exposure to air from another plant significant changes in aphid acceptance were found in seven of the 16 possible cultivar combinations of inducing and responding plants. Significant changes in leaf temperature were recorded in 11 combinations, indicating that the aphid response is part of a broader effect of plant‐plant communication.

Procedures for routine analysis of crop-available soil P by extraction with acid ammonium lactate (P-AL) have been used for nearly 50 years in Sweden, Norway and several East European countries. Aluminium and iron (Al-AL and Fe-AL) were determined in the same extract for 40 well known clayey, loamy or sandy soils from the Swedish long-term studies. Average outcome was 16.8 and 6.0% for the two elements related to extraction with chelating ammonium oxalate (Al-AO and Fe-AO) and concentrations had a correlation coefficient of 0.947 and 0.891, respectively, when the two extraction agents were compared. On average, P-AL determination using inductive coupled plasma (ICP) resulted in 19% higher soil P concentrations compared to analysis using a colorimetric method based on non-calcareous and calcareous soils from the southern counties in the Swedish soil survey, represented mainly by sandy loam soils. Degree of P saturation on a molar basis in the AL extract (DPS-AL) was determined for 22 Nordic observation fields with drained clayey, loamy and sandy soils. Results were used together with long-term flow-weighed concentration of dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentration in drainage water. These parameters were correlated (r=0.918, p=0.000) and could be fitted to a linear regression model (R2=84.3). In addition, two fields with unusually high DPS-AL values could clearly be identified as those with lowest P sorption index and highest DRP concentrations in drainage water. This demonstrates DPS-AL to have the potential as an environmental risk indicator for Swedish acid soils. A set of 230 non-calcareous soils in the southern counties of Sweden from the Swedish soil survey indicated that 3% of the soils had a high DPS-AL in the topsoil or subsoil, from which high DPS leaching probably occurs.",

The experimental plots (4×3 m) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications for spring and autumn seasons. Four pollination treatments (caged with bumblebee (BP), caged with honeybee (HP), open-pollinated (OP) and pollinator excluded (EP)) were applied. The effects of honeybee and bumblebee on alfalfa seed yield, number of pods per raceme, number of seeds per pod, and podding rate were investigated. The results of seed yield indicate that interaction between treatment groups and seasons was significant (p<0.01). The highest seed yield in alfalfa was found in OP (66.19kg/ha) in the spring followed by BP (56.48kg/ha), HP (49.20kg/ha) and EP (2.44kg/ha). With regarding to the autumn season, the highest seed yield was found in BP (26.17kg/ha) treatment followed by HP (22.89kg/ha), OP (18.12kg/ha) and EP (1.96kg/ha). The results of this research show that B. terrestris can be recommended as an alternative pollinator to honeybee for alfalfa seed production.",

    "abstract": "Summer turnip rape (Brassica rapa L.) is the dominant oilseed crop in Finland. It has lower production risks compared with summer oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). However, climate-change-induced increases in temperature accumulation could favour oilseed rape and, hence, the relative importance of the two crops could be reversed in the future. This study compared production risks associated with turnip rape and oilseed rape in two climate-change scenarios, the high-emission A2 scenario and the low-emission B1 scenario, with or without changes in the length of the growing season. To compute future changes in temperature accumulation, observations were modified by the average of temperature increases simulated by 19 global climate models. Four plant-breeding scenarios were also included: a similar pace of yield improvements as recorded over recent years, halved or doubled rates of improvement, and no improvements (levelling off). The production risks were compared by analysing the yield-value changes under projected conditions (i.e., in different combinations of scenarios) on the basis of temperature- and plant-breeding-dependent changes in seed yield, oil content, and chlorophyll content. Both plant breeding and climate change already have alone the potential to change the balance between oilseed rape and turnip rape. When acting together the change will be more apparent and faster, but plant breeding will, however, play a more significant role in yield-trend changes than will climate change under northern conditions. If the current rate of plant-breeding improvements continues, only a 100°C increase in temperature sum during the growing season would result in domination of oilseed rape over turnip rape in Finland. This comparative analysis also indicated that strategies, including doubling of oilseed crop production area, are realistic if the climate change and plant breeding achievements facilitate cultivation of oilseed crops in more northern areas. If northern areas are taken into oilseed crop production the lifespan of turnip rape in Finnish field crop production could be extended. Nevertheless, a breeding strategy for northern conditions needs increased efforts focussed on oilseed rape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A study was conducted to assess runoff and soil loss from field plots under different land use and management practices at Pokhare Khola watershed in the Dhading district of Nepal, from 2004 to 2006. Random on-farm runoff plots were established on single and double outward sloping agricultural terraces (Bari land) with four replications of three treatments, namely: Farmer practice (Zea mays–Eleusine coracana), reduced tillage (Zea mays–Vigna unguiculata), and commercial vegetable treatment (Zea mays–Capsicum sp.). The objective was to compare efficacy of reduced tillage and cropping pattern for soil restorative management with traditional farmer practice and commercial vegetable. Additionally, two forest treatments in community-managed forest and unmanaged forest with four replicate plots were established to compare the runoff and soil loss from different forest management and land use. Results indicated that 61% of the average annual rainfall (1202 mm) eroded soil; however, annual erosivity was low to medium: 1487, 2050, and 3133 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1 in 2006, 2004, and 2005, respectively. As much as 60% of total annual soil erosion occurred in just one or two major storm events during the pre-monsoon period, when soils are bare and soils freshly tilled. The result from different land use revealed that the soil loss from agricultural land (1.3 Mg ha−1 yr−1) was higher than that in forested areas (0.3 Mg ha−1 yr−1; p<0.05), but erosion rates were lower than previously reported in the Middle Mountain region, indicating a need to re-evaluate the soil-erosion problems in this region. Although reduced tillage reduced runoff by 7 to 11% and soil loss by 18 to 28%, the study suggests that reduced tillage alone will not minimize runoff and soil loss effectively on Bari land. The relationship between soil loss and rainfall characteristics was highly variable. Ground cover and cultivation activities appeared to be the most important factors affecting soil erosion processes.",

In this paper, four kinds of organic nutrient solutions (biogas slurry dilution or biogas slurry dilution with added glycine) were developed to culture lettuce in order to lower the nitrate concentrations in leafy tissue. The results showed that all organic nutrient solutions significantly decreased nitrate concentrations of lettuce shoot, and simultaneously had an increased or unbiased yield compared with inorganic nutrient solution (containing NO3 −-N solely) in sand culture with high-level nitrogen supply (8.69–15 mmol/L). In addition, glycine addition only slightly decreased nitrate concentrations in lettuce shoot both at 1:4 and 1:5 dilution rates of biogas slurry. Leafy SPAD values indicated that there were differences in lettuce N nutrition of new and old leaves responding to various N-form supplies, and no correlations between nitrate concentration and SPAD values were found. It was concluded that application of organic nutrient solutions formulated from biogas slurry dilution and amino acid in soilless cultivation is an effective means for reduction nitrate concentrations in leafy vegetables.",

Two varieties, a traditional variety from Bolivia (Real), which will not mature under Danish conditions, and an early maturing variety (Q52), developed for Danish climatic conditions, were used in this reciprocal transfer experiment. Plants were moved from a short daylength of 10 h (SD) to a long daylength of 18 h (LD) and vice versa at set intervals from sowing to 100 days after sowing (DAS). A reaction of LD in time to flowering was observed only in the Bolivian variety Real. Under SD both varieties flowered after 39 DAS. For Real the LD regime resulted in a moderate increase in time to flowering to 44 DAS. The non-sensitive, juvenile period in Real was estimated to be approximately 16 days. In Q52 a moderate increase in the number of leaves was formed on the main stem after flowering at LD, which indicates that some daylength sensitivity remains. The most striking difference occurred during seed filling, when going from SD to LD. In Q52 the time from the end of flowering to maturity increased from 39 to 52 days. Under SD, Real had a seed-filling period similar to Q52, but at LD Real remained with green leaves during seed filling. Hard seed was observed in the still green perigonium 57 days after end of flowering. At this moment re-shooting occurred from the inflorescence, and seed maturity was not reached at the termination of the experiment at 150 DAS. This study shows that flower induction is not a major problem for adaptation of quinoa to North European conditions but that a very strong, daylength sensitive, stay green reaction is the main cause of the late maturity of South American introductions.",

The primary objective of this study was to characterize the impact of grassland degradation on carbon and nitrogen budgets in Inner Mongolia, China. We investigated the changes of total carbon, organic carbon, inorganic carbon and total nitrogen that occur in a grassland ecosystem (including vegetation and top 30 cm soil layer) in the course of grassland degradation. Total carbon stored in the grassland ecosystem was reduced by up to 14%, depending on the severity of the degradation. Total nitrogen storage was reduced by almost 10% under severe degradation, but was slightly increased at light and intermediate degradation, indicating that grazing exclusion would not lead to an increase in nitrogen storage in the ecosystem. Over 98% of the total carbon and nitrogen stored in the grassland ecosystem was bound in the soil which provides the dominant and most stable carbon and nitrogen pool in the ecosystem. Most of the soil carbon and nitrogen storage was present in soil water-stable aggregates and was released as soil water-stable aggregates break in the course of grassland degradation. In conclusion, the carbon sequestration capacity of the vegetation decreased significantly, and substantial proportions of soil carbon and nitrogen were lost in the course of grassland degradation, resulting in unbalanced carbon and nitrogen budgets. Strategies to restore degraded grassland must be designed to increase the carbon and nitrogen storage potential of grassland ecosystems.",

In 2-year field experiments using urea-N fertilized grain maize (Zea mays L.), hybrid KWS 2376 at 0, 120 and 240 kg N ha−1 crop uptake of Zn, Mn, Cu and Fe was studied at DC 32, DC 61 and in the grain harvested. Micronutrient contents at DC 32 stage – 1st node (aboveground phytomass) and DC 61 – flowering (ear leaf) were all at levels indicative of adequate micronutrient supply to the crop. At both sampling occasions the Fe:Zn and Fe:Mn ratios were adequate implying that Fe did not inhibit the uptake of Zn and Mn. The application of nitrogen increased the Fe content at the 1st sampling in both years; in the second year the same was also the case for the Zn content. Nitrogen nutrition increased the contents of Mn and Fe at the 2nd sampling only in year 2; in the other treatments no changes were observed in the micronutrient contents. Micronutrient correlations in the grain were discovered between Zn and Mn contents and between Fe and Mn contents. In the second year the highest N-rate significantly increased the Fe and Zn content of the grain compared with the lower rates of nitrogen fertilization. Grain yields were not affected by the rate of nitrogen and ranged between 13.65 and 14.34 t ha−1 (1st year) and between 13.68 and 14.18 t ha−1 (2nd year). Nitrogen fertilization did not reduce the content of micronutrients in the plant or grain of maize. It is evident that the continuous single use of N fertilization so far has not resulted in a micronutrient deficiency of the plants limiting the nutrient density of the grain or reducing its quality.",

In Norway and Northern Norway in particular, the future climatic changes are expected to be overall positive. Still, the consequences for agriculture are not straightforward, but dependent on the interaction between different weather and biological elements, as well as political, economic and social conditions. In this interdisciplinary study we have assessed biological and agronomic effects of climate change, and their interaction with political, economic and social factors, to identify farmers' vulnerability and adaptive capacity to climate change. The assessments are based on downscaled climate change scenarios and interviews with local farmers in the three northernmost counties in Northern Norway (latitude 65.5° to 70°). The study shows that the farmers to a degree are vulnerable to a changing climate, not mainly because of the direct effects of changing growing conditions, but because these changes are an added factor to an already tenuous situation created by Norwegian agricultural policy and socio-economic development in general. We have found that farmers are highly adaptive, to both changing growing conditions and changing agricultural policies. However, changes in policy are currently a greater challenge to farmers than climate change, and such changes are therefore a more salient driver of vulnerability.",

On the Loess Plateau of China, vast areas of sloping cropland were converted into forest and grassland to control soil erosion. The northern plateau is a topographically heterogeneous, semi-arid region. A good understanding of the change of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage on the plateau in the process of land-cover change is important for assessing environmental changes and planning future land cover. We selected four land-cover types (cropland, planted grassland, abandoned orchard, and secondary grassland), and two vegetation covers (Stipa bungeana and Caragana korshinskii) on shady and sunny slopes, to analyse the effects of land cover and slope aspect on SOC storage. Soil C in the top 100 cm was significantly (P<0.05) greater in artificial grassland (2.49 kg m−2) and secondary grassland (2.98 kg m−2) than in cropland (1.69 kg m−2). The SOC pool in the surface soil and throughout the 1-m profile followed the order secondary grassland>artificial grassland>abandoned orchards>cropland. Sequestration extended to deep soil (80–100 cm). Slope aspect affected SOC concentration: wind erosion of the shady slope marginally reduced surface SOC relative to the sunny slope. In deep soil, responses of SOC concentration to slope aspect differed between vegetation covers: under C. korshinskii, SOC concentration was significantly greater on the shady slope (P<0.05), but no difference was found under S. bungeana.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent decades European silage maize production has extended northwards, into Scandinavia, and the importance of maize in fodder production has increased substantially. For the northward expansion of maize production it is of interest to evaluate both the role of climate change that has occurred already, and scenarios for possible future climate change. The aim of this study was to assess for Swedish climatic conditions, the annual variation in silage maize yield and quality (dry weight and starch contents) of cultivars currently grown in Germany. The MAISPROQ simulation model currently used in German maize production was applied to evaluate the effects of (i) cultivar differences (four cultivars; four sites; 2003–2009), (ii) intra-regional variation among ten sites representing three regions (two cultivars; 2003–2009), and (iii) climatic variability among two historical periods during 1961–2009 and three future periods during 2011–2100 using A2-emission climate scenarios and the Delta-method (two cultivars; four sites). Forage quality assessments strongly influenced the assessments of harvest time and thereby the yield. Changes in simulated yield of the tested cultivars were high for the past climate, but relatively small under future climatic conditions due to earlier harvest caused by improved forage quality. By the end of the 21st century an appropriate fodder quality would be achieved every year in the south of Sweden, whereas in the middle of Sweden (60°N) about 30% of the years would not be successful, even for the earliest cultivar. In the east, increased water stress counteracted the positive effect of a prolonged growing season. It was concluded that adaptation of field experiments to model calibration requirements remains to be done, in order to enable extrapolation of observations from Swedish field trials to a changing future climate.",

The LARS-WG was used to generate climate scenarios using observed climate data (1961–90) from two sites in Denmark, which differed in climate and soil conditions. Scenarios involved changes to (i) mean temperature alone, (ii) mean and variability of temperature, (iii) winter and summer precipitation amounts and (iv) duration of dry and wet series. The model predicted lower grain yield and N uptake in response to increases in mean temperatures, caused by early maturity, with little change in variability. This, however, increased soil mineral N causing increased N losses. On sandy loam, larger temperature variability lowered grain yields and increased N losses coupled with higher variability at all the mean temperature ranges. On coarse sand, grain yields either remained unaltered or were slightly reduced when larger temperature variability was introduced to increase in mean temperatures of up to +2°C above baseline. However, introducing variability to further increase in mean temperatures lowered yields without any change in variability. Larger temperature variability did not affect soil mineral N and N2O emissions, but increased N leaching on coarse sand. Large response in grain yield, N uptake and soil N cycling, and in their variability was predicted when summer precipitation was varied, whereas only N leaching responded to changes in winter precipitation. Doubling the duration of dry series lowered grain yield and N removed by grain, but increased N leaching, whereas doubling the duration of wet series showed opposite effect. Predicted responses to changes in precipitation patterns were larger on coarse sand than on sandy loam. This study illustrates the importance of considering effects of changes to mean climatic factors, climatic variability and soil types on both crop yield and soil N losses",

In addition, supplementation of P and Fe improved leaf chlorophyll content (determined as SPAD value), nitrate concentration significantly or slightly of the lettuces but not vitamin C content. However, addition of P and Fe or microelements through foliar spray is not effective in enhancement of growth and quality except for improving leaf SPAD.

We isolated phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) from acidic soil (Ultisols) in the field from the layer of 0–150 mm at a tea garden located at 28°38′26″ N and 116°24′27″ E. The capacity of bacterial isolates to solubilize mineral phosphate was tested on aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) in liquid medium. Among these PSB, isolate B1 (identified as Bacillus thuringiensis) exhibited the maximum P-solubilizing ability and was particularly efficient at solubilizing AlPO4 (up to 321 mg L−1) in vitro. The isolate B1 was inoculated to an acidic soil to study its effect on phosphate solubilization and growth of peanuts (Arachis hypogeae). The Olsen-P in the tested soil increased from 14.7 to 23.4 mg kg−1, with solubilization of 16.4 mg kg−1 soil of Occluded-P after 14-day incubation. The inoculation by B1 significantly increased plant height (from 37.7 to 45.7 cm), number of branches (from 34.0 to 52.7 per plant), hundred-seed weight (from 42.1 to 46.9 g) and crude protein content (from 243.5 to 268.2 g kg−1 dry weight). The phosphate-solubilizing B. thuringiensis strain B1 showed potential as a biological phosphorus fertilizer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The dominant factors affecting crop production in Northeast China are the low amount of rainfall in spring and high loss of soil water through evaporation during summer, both of which contribute to the lower soil water use efficiency (WUE). The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of no-till (NT), reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil water storage (SWS), WUE, and soybean and corn yields in Northeast China from 2009 to 2011. The soil water contents under NT were higher than CT, especially in the 0–30 cm soil. SWS was lower in spring and autumn but higher in summer and it was influenced by both rainfall and tillage practices. NT had the greatest SWS and CT the least, with RT having intermediate values in the 30-cm surface. Leaf area index was higher for CT compared with the RT and NT in corn, but it was higher for RT than CT and NT in soybean. The evapotranspiration in the crop growing seasons was higher for NT and RT than for CT in the two corn years (2009, 2011), but no differences were found in the soybean year (2010). The WUE was greatly affected by weather conditions, (i.e., 64% lower in the wet year), and also affected by tillage; that is, CT and RT were 36 and 15% higher than NT in 2009, but no differences in other years. We conclude that RT was a good compromise for both soybean and corn crops, as it was associated with higher economic returns for farmers. Further research is required to compare the effect of the conservation tillage on the WUE and economic returns for other locations in Northeast China.",

    "abstract": "Since the Middle Ages the Dutch have reclaimed many lakes and parts of the sea, creating polders. Drainage is required to use the land: for the inhabitants, for agriculture and for nature. Traditionally drainage was by gravity: through open (and later pipe) drains excess rainfall was transferred into open collector drains, from where the water was pumped out to a river, lake or the sea. Since the 1950s, land use has been changing towards a more diverse and intensive agriculture, more attention for nature, recreation and continuing urbanization. On top of this, the climate is changing: significant increases in precipitation, both average and extreme. Until recently, the solution to more excess water was to increase pump capacity. Yet the combined problems of climate change, sea level rise, subsidence and urbanization require more structural changes in water management. Drainage systems have to be modified to enable the shift from a strategy of rapid removal of all excess water to one that continuously controls water levels individually in each agricultural plot. A new approach of 'retention, storage and controlled removal' is being used to develop climate adaptation scenarios for the three hydro-ecological zones in the Netherlands, i.e.: (1) the man-made polder areas with marine clay soils along the North Sea coast and the former Zuider Sea; (2) the low-lying peat lands in the west and north; and (3) the sandy and loamy soils areas in the centre, south and east. New approaches for tailor-made drainage solutions following this strategy are being tested in various pilot areas in the three zones. Although the research is still ongoing, this paper presents the lessons learned to date related to the challenges, risks and limitations associated with the introduction of these new drainage strategies for coping with climate change in the Netherlands.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Growing rice under aerobic soil conditions is a promising water-wise technology under the context of ever-mounting water scarcity, but it is subject to poor stand establishment and high weed pressure. The present study was, therefore, designed to explore the possibility of adopting seed priming as a sustainable tool for weed management in aerobic rice. The trough experiment was established with aerobic rice line Aeron 1 considering four priming techniques: hydropriming, hardening, Zappa® priming and untreated control; and two weeding regimes: weed-free and weedy. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Seed priming significantly improved germination attributes, weed suppressive ability and yield of rice, whilst unprimed control exhibited inconsistent germination, poor stand establishment and less weed competitiveness resulting in poor yield. Seed priming resulted in reduced mean germination time and increased germination percentage, germination index and seedling vigour index. Weed dry matter reduction by primed stand of rice ranged from 22% to 27% compared with control. A positive influence of seed priming was also evident in rice yield with an average increment of 0.4 t ha−1 over control. Weed-inflicted relative yield loss of rice was minimized by 10% as a consequence of seed priming. Zappa® solution emerged as the best priming agent, which demands its incorporation as a viable component in an integrated weed management strategy for aerobic rice.",

The influence of different doses of compost (50 and 100 Mg ha−1) and N-mineral fertilizer (35-70-140 kg N ha−1) on leaching of Nmin in a lysimetric experiment with winter wheat. The area of our interest represents the main source of drinking water for the city of Brno and its neighborhoods. To demonstrate the effect of compost and mineral nitrogen addition, the lysimetric experiment was established there. Seven variants of the experiment with different fertilization schemes were studied during two vegetation seasons (2013 and 2014), each with three repetitions. The experiment was carried out in plastic experimental containers of 0.3 m diameter and 0.5 m height. Therefore, each lysimeter was the same size and was filled with 25 kg of subsoil and 25 kg of topsoil. The highest leaching of Nmin was detected in the variant C2 where 140 kg N ha−1 was applied, in both vegetation periods (5.97 kg Nmin ha−1 after the first vegetation period and 17.02 kg Nmin ha−1 after the second vegetation period). The positive effect of compost application (individually or in combination with the mineral N) on decrease in mineral N leaching was found during both vegetation period in comparison with variant C2. The highest doses of compost (100 Mg per ha) significantly decreased the concentration of mineral nitrogen in the soil eluate in both periods (3.03 kg Nmin ha−1 and 5.79 kg Nmin ha−1, respectively), by 197% and 293% in comparison with variant C2. There is evidence that the application of compost has a positive effect on the reduction of Nmin leaching.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that liming can improve soil structure and thereby decrease losses of particles and associated nutrients. In this study, two types of structure lime, slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) and a mixed product of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2), were applied at three different rates in field trials on clayey soils (23%–40% clay). A combination of primary tillage and structure liming was also studied, in a split-plot trial on a clayey soil (25% clay). Aggregate (2–5 mm) stability, measured as reduction in turbidity (which is strongly correlated with losses of particulate phosphorus), was significantly increased with the highest application rates of both structure lime products. Aggregate size distribution was also improved with structure lime, creating a finer tilth in the seedbed. Yield response to structure lime was not consistent, with both negative and positive responses over the four-year study period. Positive yield responses can possibly be attributed to the finer tilth preventing evaporation in two dry growing seasons. Negative yield responses were probably an effect of impaired phosphorus availability associated with limited precipitation in May-July in 2011 and 2013. Two years after liming, soil pH levels were significantly elevated in plots with the highest application rate of structure lime, whereas no significant increases were found three years after liming. However, a lingering effect of liming was still detectable, as manganese concentration in barley grain was significantly lower in plots with the highest application rates of both structure lime products in the fourth study year. These results indicate that structure liming can be used as a measure to mitigate phosphorus losses from clayey soils, thereby preventing eutrophication of nearby waters. However, the yield response was varying and unpredictable and thus further investigations are needed to determine the circumstances in which field liming can act efficiently not only to prevent phosphorus losses, but also to ensure consistent yield increases.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] has been cultivated for centuries as a staple food crop for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In Ethiopia a total of 4.34 million tons of sorghum is being produced per annum, predominantly in the arid and semi-arid areas. However, the yield and quality of sorghum is affected by a wide array of production constraints, notably severe and recurrent drought stress. The aim of this study were to determine the impact of drought on sorghum production and productivity over time and space, and to identify farmers' trait preferences, production constraints and coping strategies when dealing with drought in north eastern Ethiopia.Materials and methods: Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) was employed in three administrative zones of north eastern Ethiopia. One Woreda from each Zone and two Kebeles from each Woreda were selected on the basis of sorghum area coverage, production, consumption and prior information on the intensity, duration and spatial coverage of drought. In each kebele, 30 respondents were selected for interview and 12 key informants were selected for group discussions and transect walk personal observations. Data collected from 180 respondents was subjected to statistical analysis and the information gathered from 72 key informants through focus group discussions and transect walk observations were used in discussing the results.Results and discussion: The present study found that productivity of sorghum was challenged by recurrent droughts, Striga infestation, insects, birds, diseases, a lack of varieties with farmers-preferred traits and high yield potential, limited policy support, a lack of improved seed system, poor sorghum production practices and application of crop input and poor soil fertility, in a decreasing order of importance. Among the listed sorghum production constraints, severe drought in the post-flowering stage was identified by most interviewed farmers as the leading constraint across the three study zones. Focus group discussions and transect walk observations held in each Kebele revealed that farmers' had lost numerous valuable local landrace varieties due to extreme drought conditions over the years. A significant number of interviewed farmers preferred to grow high grain and biomass yielder medium-maturing sorghum varieties which can be sown at the normal planting time but which would escape post-flowering drought.Conclusion: Overall, sorghum breeding programme should be directed at developing farmers' ideal sorghum varieties with high grain and biomass yield, adequate level of drought and Striga tolerance. In addition, development of farmer preferred medium-maturing sorghum varieties suitable for April planting should be strengthen to boost its productivity and to increase varietal adoption rate in the area.",

    "abstract": "Row crops such as potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) and carrots (Daucus carota L.) are of high economic value in the Nordic countries. Their production is becoming more and more specialized, including continuous arable cropping and heavier farm machinery, with increased risk of soil compaction. The result may be restricted root development and economic losses. Potatoes have widely branched adventitious roots, whereas carrots have taproots with fibrous roots extending from them. Under optimal soil conditions, total root length per surface area may reach more than 10 km m−2 for both species. Maximal root depth is about 140 cm for potato and more than 200 cm in carrots. Most of the root mass is usually distributed within the upper 100 cm, whereof more than 50% may be deeper than 30 cm. Soil compaction causes a dense soil with few large pores, poor drainage and reduced aeration, especially in wet soils with low organic matter content and high proportions of silt or clay. With compacted subsoil layers, roots will be concentrated more in the upper layers and thus explore a smaller soil volume. This will lead to reduced water and nutrient uptake, reduced yields and low nutrient utilization efficiency. In this review article, we describe the interactions between root development and soil conditions for potatoes and carrots, with special focus on sub-optimal conditions caused by soil compaction. We also discuss the effects of tilling strategies, organic material, irrigation and fertilization strategies and controlled traffic systems on root and yield development. To reduce subsoil compaction there is a need to implement practises such as controlled traffic farming, new techniques for ploughing, better timing of soil operations, crop rotations with more perennial crops and supplements of organic material. Moreover, there is a need for a stronger focus on the impacts of farm machinery dimensions.",

However, still half of the farms exceeded the European nitrate standard for groundwater of 50 mg/l in the 2008–2011 period. To assure that farms will comply with the quality standard, an empirical model is used to derive environmentally sound N use standards for sandy soils for different crops and soil drainage conditions. Key parameters in this model are the nitrate-N leaching fractions (NLFs) for arable land and grassland on deep, well-drained sandy soils. NLFs quantify the fraction of the N surplus on the soil balance that leaches from the root zone to groundwater and this fraction represents N available for leaching and denitrification. The aim of this study was to develop a method for calculating these NLFs by using data from a random sample of commercial arable farms and dairy farms that were monitored in the 1991–2009 period. Only mean data per farm were available, which blocked a direct derivation of NLFs for unique combinations of crop type, soil type and natural soil drainage conditions. Results showed that N surplus leached almost completely from the root zone of arable land on the most vulnerable soils, that is, deep, well-drained sandy soils (95% confidence interval of NLF 0.80–0.99), while for grassland only half of the N surplus leached from the root zone of grassland (0.39–0.49). The NLF for grassland decreased with 0.015 units/year, which is postulated to be due to a decreased grazing and increased year-round housing of dairy cows. NLFs are positively correlated with precipitation surplus (0.05 units/100 mm for dairy farms and 0.10 units/100 mm for arable farms). Therefore, an increase in precipitation due to climate change may lead to an increase in leaching of nitrate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Losses of commonly used chemical pesticides from agricultural land may cause serious problems in recipient waters in a similar way to phosphorus (P). Due to analytical challenges concerning determination of glyphosate (Gly), transport behaviour of this widely used herbicide is still not well known. The objective of the present study was to quantify and evaluate leaching of Gly in parallel with P. Leaching losses of autumn-applied Gly (1.06 kg ha−1) via drainage water were examined by flow-proportional sampling of discharge from 20 drained plots in a field experiment in eastern Sweden. Samples were analysed for Gly in particulate-bound (PGly) and dissolved (DGly) form. The first 10 mm water discharge contained no detectable Gly, but the following 70 mm had total Gly (TotGly) concentrations of up to 6 µg L−1, with 62% occurring as PGly. On average, 0.7 g TotGly ha−1 was leached from conventionally ploughed plots, compared with 1.7 g TotGly ha−1 from shallow-tilled plots (cultivator to 12 cm working depth). Higher Gly losses occurred in snowmelt periods in spring, but then with the majority (60%) as DGly. All autumn concentrations of PGly in drainage water were significantly correlated (p<0.001) to the concentrations of particulate-bound phosphorus (PP) lost from the different plots (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.84), while PP concentrations were in turn significantly correlated to water turbidity (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.81). Leaching losses of TotGly were significantly lower (by 1.3 g ha−1; p<0.01) from plots that had been structure-limed three years previously and ploughed thereafter than from shallow-tilled plots. Turbidity and PP concentration also tended to be lowest in discharge from structure-limed plots and highest from shallow-tilled plots. This difference in TotGly leaching between soil management regimes could not be explained by differences in measured pH in drainage water or amount of discharge. However, previously structure-limed plots had significantly better aggregate stability, measured as readily dispersed clay (RDC), than unlimited plots. The effects of building up good soil structure, with strong soil aggregates and an appropriate pore system in the topsoil, on mitigating Gly and P losses in particulate and dissolved form should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Environmental stress as salinity can negatively affect the physiology of tomato plants. Conditions leading to a reduction of transpiration can contribute to greater tolerance to salinity. Use of kaolin-based particle film technology (PFT) may be an effective tool to control stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, thus mitigating the detrimental effect of salinity. The present three-year study has investigated the effects of kaolin application on leaf gas exchange, leaf water potential, leaf and canopy temperature of field-grown tomato, irrigated with brackish water by drip method, in southern Italy. Treatments were: (1) three salinity levels of irrigation water (electrical conductivity of water = 0.5, 5 and 10 dS m−1); (2) tomato plants treated or not with kaolin; and (3) two cultivars in each year. The increase in salinity caused the reduction of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis and transpiration rate, and the increase of leaf and canopy temperature. Kaolin has resulted in an improvement of leaf water potential, and the reduction in gas exchange variables in low-salinity conditions. Under high salinity, kaolin was effective in limiting the reductions in net photosynthesis and reducing leaf and canopy temperature. These latter variables were slightly affected by kaolin, in different ways in respect to the saline treatments; while in non-saline conditions were 0.2–0.5°C higher in the kaolin-treated plants, the situation was reversed in more saline treatment. The variation of leaf and canopy temperature shows that kaolin influences the thermal balance mainly for the dual effect of reflection of the incident radiation and partial occlusion of the stomata. Kaolin mitigated detrimental effects of salinity also on yield, contributing to the improvement of income for the farmers. The use of kaolin-based PFT may be an effective tool to alleviate salinity stress in tomato production under arid and semi-arid conditions.",

However, a potential source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) carried by PGPRs and derived biocontrol agents and/or bio-fertilizers is widely forgotten and ignored. It is very urgent to raise the question if large-scale introduction of beneficial bacteria into soils can aggravate the situation in the spread of ARGs in environment. In this article, we conclude and analyze the possibility of a potential ARGs reservoir associated with introduction of PGPR strains into soils, and offer some advice on PGPR isolation, development and application.",

Shoot and root biomass production was measured 30 days after emergence. Plant responses, including roots and shoots dry weight per pot, were described by a three parameter log-logistic regression model as a function of sulfosulfuron or tribenuron methyl doses and the relative sensitivities were calculated at the various ED-levels with their associated 95% confidence intervals. The most precise ED-levels were that at ED50 and sensitivity rank was oilseed rape, sugar beet, corn and barley, whatever the chosen response level and herbicide. We calculated relative sensitivities at ED10, ED50 and ED90 for the species of barley, the most tolerant crop, as reference. Comparison of relative sensitivity of crops to both herbicides showed that the sensitivity of these crops was much larger for tribenuron methyl than for sulfosulfuron. Oilseed rape was the most sensitive species (ED50 = 0.202 and 0.179 µg kg−1 soil for root dry weight (RDW) response to sulfosulfuron and tribenuron methyl, respectively) while barley was the most tolerant one (ED50 = 1.008 and 3.68 µg kg−1soil for RDW response to sulfosulfuron and tribenuron methyl, respectively). Sugar beet and corn had intermediate sensitivity. Also, we demonstrated how important it is to show the confidence intervals of relative sensitivities. In several instances the relative sensitivities, even numerically large, were not significantly different from 1.00. We demonstrate that classifying biotypes as resistant to a herbicide requires the threshold of resistance/susceptible (R/S) of 4.00 only be accepted if confidence intervals do not cover 1.00.",

Soil organic matter has equal value as mineral part if we want to improve soil quality or increase the yield. Because of intensive farming, irresponsible use of mineral fertilizers and natural factors, soil organic matter is decreasing. To counteract this process, different soil-friendly management practices and techniques, such as shallow tillage, no-tillage or direct drilling and application of additional organic matter are used. The objective of the present study was to assess the changes in the intensity of soil organic matter mineralization as influenced by primary soil tillage of different intensity in combination with organic matter incorporation. Long-term studies showed that land management practices differentiated the soil into two layers: upper (0–10 cm) layer containing more moisture and nutrients and lower (10–20 cm) layer comprising less moisture and nutrients. The conditions of aeration in the arable soil layer did not change under the effect of ploughing. In this soil, the rate of mineralization was lower than that in the ploughless tillage treatment. The most active mineralization of soil organic matter in the ploughless tillage treatment occurred in the autumn period, when high level of rainfall promoted the loss of nutrients from the topsoil layer.",

To evaluate factors influencing soil erodibility at a proposed dam site, 21 soil samples collected were characterized. The soils were analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC), exchangeable bases, exchangeable acidity, pH, electrical conductivities, mean weight diameter and soil particles' size distribution. Cation exchange capacity, exchangeable sodium percentage, sodium adsorption ratio, dispersion ratio (DR), clay flocculation index (CFI), clay dispersion ratio (CDR) and Ca:Mg ratio were then calculated. Soil erodibility (K-factor) estimates were determined using SOC content and surface soil properties. Soil loss rates by splashing were determined under rainfall simulations at 360 mmh−1 rainfall intensity. Soil loss was correlated to the measured chemical and physical soil properties. There were variations in soil form properties and erodibility indices showing influence on soil loss. The average soil erodibility and SOC values were 0.0734 t MJ−1 mm−1 and 0.81%, respectively. SOC decreased with depth and soil loss increased with a decrease in SOC content. SOC significantly influenced soil loss, CDR, CFI and DR (P < .05). The soil loss rate was 5.60 t/ha per 8 minute rainstorm of 360 mmh−1. Addition of organic matter stabilize the soils against erosion.",

Rates of CO2 emission were measured by the closed chamber method using an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) at intervals of 2-3 weeks from May to October. The seasonal changes in SR were different among the soil types: peat soil, maximum rate (650 mg CO2 m-2 h-1) in summer, positive significant relation between SR and ST and negative relation between SR and SWC; sandy soil, stable SR (300 mg CO2 m-2 h-1) without seasonal changes, positive relation between SR and SWC and no significant relation between SR and ST; clay soil, maximum rate (500 mg CO2 m-2 h-1) in summer, highly positive significant relation between SR and ST and negative relation between SR and SWC. A statistical model was developed to predict the amount of CO2 evolved from the cultivated soils based on the relationships between SR and certain abiotic environmental factors. The model calculation indicated that the amount of CO2 evolved from Finnish agricultural soils during the cultivation period was comparable to the values obtained from different locations around the world. These suggest that soils in northern crop fields release a relatively large amount of CO2, equivalent to that in regions with warm-temperate and temperate climates.",

Fertilisation practices are focused on high yield and forage quality but effects of nutrients on nodulation and N2 fixation are poorly understood. The aim of this work was to study how nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) separately as well as in combination affected nodulation. Red clover plants were grown in pots with gravel in a greenhouse for 11 weeks. To resemble field conditions the root temperature was kept lower than the shoot temperature. Plants were given five different combinations of N and P concentrations during growth. The result showed that at high N concentrations P had a counteracting effect on the N inhibition. The N2-fixation parameters, nodule number, nodule dry matter and specific nitrogenase activity, were six times higher in plants grown with high N and high P than in plants with high N and low P. When the N2-fixation parameters and the dry matter of roots and shoots were related to total plant dry matter, there was a stronger effect of P on nodulation parameters than on roots and shoots. This indicates that P has a direct effect on the N2-fixation parameters, rather than an indirect effect via increased plant growth. These results demonstrate the importance to studying the effects of more than one nutrient at a time. Keywords: N2-FIXATIONNitrogenPhosphorusRed Clover",

In 34 plots soil N uptake by crops, net nitrogen mineralization (Nm) during the growing season and soil mineral N in spring and shortly after harvest were determined. Beside these parameters, topography, soil organic matter content (SOM), clay content, pH(H 2 O) and grain yield were recorded. The variations in Nm were considerably large both within the field and between years. The within-field variation in Nm could partly be explained by the variation in SOM and clay content (adjusted coefficient of determination = 0.23, P <0.001). The pattern in Nm differed between years, partly because of seasonal variations in soil moisture. For these reasons, the pattern of Nm is difficult to predict without seasonal adjustments.

Phosphorus application rate was modified by crop P removal. Additional factors for: 1) P release by freezing of plant residues, 2) flooding frequency, 3) risk of leaching, and 4) annual precipitation were included. Management practices in the Index were adjusted to reflect the effect of time and method of P application on P loss, as well as erosion control measures relevant to agricultural management in Norway rather than Pennsylvania. Testing of the suggested P Index showed that it ranks the potential for P loss from several agricultural catchments in the south-eastern part of Norway relatively well (R 2=0.79).

Plant samples were also collected and analyzed for Cd. Significant differences in extractable Cd by all the extractants except NH4NO3 were observed between the newly and long-term cultivated soils. The Cd concentrations in plants were not increased by the elevated extractable Cd. Although significant relationships were observed between plant Cd and extractable soil Cd, none of the extractants used alone gave a good assessment of plant-available Cd for all the samples used in this study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the present study was to estimate the influence of different rates of soil-applied nitrogen on leaf N and chlorophyll content and photosynthesis in 'Golden Delicious' apple trees. Three different treatments were included: the trees were either fertilized with 80 kg N ha−1 (N-80), 250 kg N ha−1 (N-250) or left unfertilized (CON). Fertilization increased leaf nitrogen content, with a more prominent effect in high N application level treatment. In all treatments, a slight seasonal decrease in leaf nitrogen content was observed. N-250 treatment resulted in higher chlorophyll content; a similar effect was found late in the season for N-80 treatment. Measurements of A-C i curves, performed on spur leaves, revealed a higher CO2 saturated photosynthetic rate in N-250 trees compared with low application level fertilized or unfertilized trees. No effect of N fertilization on carboxylation efficiency was found, as revealed by comparisons of the initial slopes of A-C i curves. The lack of positive effect is rather surprising, since the leaf N content was efficiently increased with application of fertilizer. Obviously, the existing pool of leaf nitrogen in non-fertilized trees does not limit Rubisco activity and efficiency.",

Seeds were osmoprimed in four water potentials (−0.5, −1.0, −1.5 and −2.0 MPa) of polyethylene glycol (PEG) or in 4% mannitol in addition to hydropriming for 12 or 24 h at 25±1°C in darkness. Following priming, the seeds were subjected to germination tests at ten different constant temperatures ranging from 5 to 32±0.5°C. In general, there was no significant effect of priming treatments on germination percentage. However, compared to unprimed seeds, hydropriming and osmopriming treatments induced faster and more synchronous germination at all of the temperatures tested and also significantly decreased thermal time requirements. These reductions in thermal time requirements ranged between 18.1°C d and 30.3°C d for 50% germination. Seeds treated with water for 12 h generally produced the highest germination speed and the lowest thermal time requirement values. Among the osmopriming treatments, seeds treated with −0.5 MPa solution of PEG for 24 h gave the best results. Consequently, hydropriming for 12 h or osmopriming (PEG −0.5 MPa) for 24 h may be recommended for a better germination of chickpeas under cold soil conditions.",

The inclusion of pea in cereal seeds and the increasing of its seed density led to substantial decreases in the grain yields of the cereal component. The reason for these decreases was the formation of smaller grains in cereals when intercropped with pea. The inclusion of pea in a cereal crop and the increasing of its seed density led to substantial increases in the protein content of the cereal grains. In barley and oats the increases in grain protein content were the lowest of the three cereals. At the same time, the maximum protein yield per area unit in cereals was obtained from plots of pure crops. In a mix with pea, the amounts of nitrogen consumed by cereals decreased and the protein yield of cereals per area unit were reduced in intercrops. Pea-cereal mixes had an advantage over cereal sole crops with regard to protein yield, due to the pea component. Pea-cereal mixes are particularly suitable for the conditions of organic farming, and should be recommended to farmers, as they ensure a relatively good harvest and high protein yield on soil without nitrogen fertilizers. In conclusion, the study showed that, of the three combinations, pea-oat mixed intercrops gave the highest yield of grain and protein yields.",

The experiment included four treatments: bare soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (CK), and maize-cropped soils amended with 0 (N0), 150 (N150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha−1 yr−1. The cumulative soil CO2 emission in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments was estimated to be 698, 863, 962, and 854 g CO 2 C m−2, respectively. The seasonal soil CO2 fluxes were significantly affected by soil temperature, with a Q 10 value between 1.99 and 2.47. Analysis of the stepwise regression indicated that the CO2 flux can be quantitatively described by a linear combination of soil moisture content and soil temperature 5 cm below ground. Approximately 70, 58, 60, and 44% of the variability in CO2 flux can be explained by these two parameters, in CK, N0, N150, and N250, respectively. Nitrogen fertilization with 150 kg N ha−1 yr−1 increased CO2 fluxes by 14.5% compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha−1 yr−1. However, in the soil fertilized with 250 kg N ha−1 yr−1, high N fertilization suppressed soil respiration. There was an exponential relationship between soil temperature 5 cm below ground and N2O flux, with a Q 10 value of 1.30–2.91. Mean cumulative soil N2O emissions during the maize-growing season in the CK, N0, N150, and N250 treatments were estimated to be 86, 44, 200, and 484 mg N2O-N m−2, respectively. In contrast to the maize planting, soil fertilized with 150 kg N ha−1 yr−1 and with 250 kg N ha−1 yr−1 increased N2O fluxes by 354 and 1000%, compared with soils fertilized with 0 kg N ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Soil respiration and N2O fluxes measurement using the root-exclusion technique indicated that the rhizosphere of the maize could be the dominant habitat of soil respiration and N2O formation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effects of pretreatment with salicylic acid on wheat seed germination (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Roshan), lipid peroxidation, and superoxide dismutase, catalase, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase activity were studied under conditions of salt stress. Seeds treated with different concentrations of salicylic acid were used for measuring germination traits. Salt stress was induced by sodium chloride solution. Seeds were soaked in salicylic acid solution for 24 h, dried with sterile paper, transferred to sterile Petri dishes, and treated with 10 ml NaCl solution at different concentrations. After 1 week, the number of germinated seeds, root length, seedling length, and dry weight were recorded. Antioxidant enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation were also assayed. Salinity decreased seed germination. Thus, a high concentration of NaCl (200 mM) decreased germination by 17.6% compared with control treatment. Salicylic acid significantly increased germination in stressed and control seeds. Salicylic acid increased the level of cell division of seedlings and roots, which increased plant growth. Salt stress significantly increased the activity of the antioxidative enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase in wheat seedlings, and salicylic acid reduced the activity of antioxidant enzymes as stress signal molecules. Our results indicated that scavenging of reactive oxygen species was effective, especially by salicylic acid, and that membrane damage was limited. The aim of the present work was to study the character of changes in enzymatic systems induced by NaCl and salicylic acid in wheat seedlings under conditions of salt stress. In brief, salicylic acid treatment reduced the damaging action of salinity on embryo growth and accelerated a restoration of growth processes; thereupon it may be effective for the improvement of seed germination in arid and semi-arid regions.",

The NT and DT plots produced the lowest soil CO2 effluxes of 0.3 and 0.7 g m−2 h−1, respectively, relative to the other plots (P < 0.001). Following the highest rainfall amount of 87 mm on the tenth day after the tillage, soil CO2 efflux rates of all the plots peaked on the 12th day, with less influence on soil CO2 efflux in the NT plot than in the conventional tillage plots. Soil evaporation in NT (64 mmol m−2 s−1) was significantly lower than in the PT (85 mmol m−2 s−1) and RT (89 mmol m−2 s−1) tillage treatments (P < 0.01). The best multiple-regression model selected explained 46% of variation in soil respiration rates as a function of the tillage treatments, soil temperature, and soil evaporation (P < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Abstract The nitrogen and phosphorus contents of meat and bone meal (MBM) make it a potentially valuable nutrient source in agriculture. Its narrow N:P ratio, however, makes it a potential environmental risk if it is not utilized with caution. A column-leaching experiment was conducted to assess potential nitrogen and phosphorus leaching from bare soils fertilized with MBM. This should give an idea of the efficacy of autumn or early spring MBM application on land devoid of vegetation cover. Earlier greenhouse and field experiments have indicated that nitrogen mineralization after MBM application takes place relatively rapidly. The column experiment conducted here has indicated that spring application of MBM prior to planting can result in the loss of mineral nitrogen, reducing the total amount of N available to the crop. A higher initial loss (up to 47 mg l−1) of ammonium was found for the MBM treated soils, but this declined to less than 0.1 mg l−1 by the end of the experiment, 11 weeks later. Nitrate loss was highest at the onset of the experiment for the soils that received mineral N fertilizer. With time, however, the largest nitrate losses were associated with the MBM-treated soils. Nitrate leaching continued to well beyond the end of the experiment. The effect will most certainly be exacerbated when the crop N (rather than crop P) requirement forms the basis for MBM application. The amount of P leached as ortho-P is probably small but may also represent an environmental risk if N remains to be the basis of MBM application. Based on the results presented here and considering the dangers of elevated nutrient losses, autumn and early spring MBM application may not be recommended.",

The species were blueberry, apple, aronia, sour cherry, sweet cherry, red raspberry, strawberry, blackcurrant, gooseberry, red currant and elderberry, harvested along with wild bilberry, cloudberry and lingonberry. Significant differences between species were identified for all quality parameters. The coefficient of variation between species was lowest for pH (12.5%), dry matter (18.9%) and soluble solids (25.3%), followed by titratable acids (59.3%), total phenolics (83.8%), antioxidant capacity FRAP (85.7%) and antiradical power by the DPPH-assay (97.8%), total monomeric anthocyanins (132%) and ascorbic acid (137%). Average coefficient of variation within species were lower and ranged from 4 (pH) to 62% (ascorbic acid). Only the FRAP values were significantly affected by harvesting year with lower levels in 2004 than in 2005 and 2006. There were significant interactions between species and harvesting year for dry matter, soluble solids, pH, ascorbic acid and FRAP. The results indicate generic ranges in composition within species independent upon growing location and climate, and the composition of the tree fruits and berries is not likely to deviate from these ranges. It is concluded that desirable composition of tree fruits and berries and their products should primarily be achieved by selection among species rather than searching fors broadened variation within individual species.",

This study reports the positive effect of pulsed electromagnetic field on the main root characteristics (fresh weight, dry weight, root surface and length) of unrooted oregano stem cuttings. For oregano, vegetative propagation is commonly used, with rooted or unrooted stem cuttings, because seed propagation is not suggested for commercial cultivation. Oregano seeds are very small and, thus, difficult to handle. Vegetative reproduction in organic cultivation faces the ethical problem of the use of hormones to induce the rooting process in propagation beds. The purpose of this study was to determine if magnetic field can replace hormones in plant propagation and what the results of the combination of both magnetic field and hormones would be. Two types of stem cuttings were used (apical and middle) and the experiment was established in two different seasons (spring and autumn). The findings showed that magnetic field alone stimulates the rooting process in plant material, with results similar to or even statistically significantly better than those obtained using hormones. However, the combination of magnetic field and hormones resulted in measurements statistically significantly lower than with magnetic field alone. Such methods can potentially be useful for plant materials growers, providing better oregano seedlings, especially in organic farming, where chemical compounds are forbidden.",

In Ghana, there is an undersupply caused by production ceasing entirely from October to May due to high temperatures. Heat stress has been reported to cause excessive flower drop leading to drastic reduction in yield; however, genotypic differences in heat tolerance exist in tomato. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to screen 19 different tomato genotypes for their tolerance to heat stress. The genotypes were selected because they were the commercial varieties widely available to farmers. The average day and night temperatures recorded were 33.8°C and 25.9°C, respectively. Cultivars were evaluated for heat adaptation traits such as flower drop and number of fruits. There were highly significant differences between the genotypes for numbers of fruits per plant, ranging from 1 to 27. Fruit yield per plant ranged from 26.7 to 571.8 g. The locally developed open pollinated cultivar ‘Nkansah’ had the highest fruit number and fruit yield per plant, but produced the smallest sized fruits of only 25.2 g. Cultivars with large size fruits were ‘Queen’, ‘DV 2962’ and ‘Wosowoso’ with a combined average of 85.7 g. The first two principal components (PCs) accounted for 79.7% of total variation. The first PC had positive weights for number of flowers per truss, number of fruits per plant, total number of flowers, yield per plant and number of trusses. PC2 explained 11% of the total variability among genotypes and had positive weights for all traits except number of days to flowering and weight per fruit. The highly contrasting material on traits such as flower and fruit production under high temperatures can be used for further research to elucidate the physiological responses conferring adaptation to heat stress.",

No tillage led to a significantly greater aggregation for >1 mm aggregate and significant SOC changes in this fraction at 0–5 cm depth. There were significant positive relationships between SOC and >1 mm aggregate, SOC in each aggregate fraction, but there was no relationship between soil aggregate parameters (the proportion of soil aggregates, aggregate-associated SOC and soil stability) and soil bulk density. After 5 years, there was no difference in Dm of soil aggregate size distribution among tillage treatments, which suggested that Dm could not be used as an indicator to assess short-term effects of tillage practices on soil aggregation. In the short term, > 1 mm soil aggregate was a better indicator to characterize the impacts of tillage practices on quality of a Chinese Mollisol, particularly in the near-surface layer of the soil.",

    "abstract": "Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crtz., false flax) is described as a species requiring fewer inputs than other oilseed crops thus making it an interesting alternative in sustainable cropping systems. As information on the combined effects of nitrogen and sulphur on camelina yield and quality parameters is meagre, a pot fertilization experiment was carried out with nitrogen applied as NH4NO3 at three increasing rates equivalent to a range from 63 up to 127 kg ha−1. These treatments were combined with sulphur additions applied as (NH4)2SO4 to achieve a soil sulphate content of 25 or 45 mg kg−1, respectively (equivalent to 75 and 135 kg S ha−1). The medium and high nitrogen rates combined with the low sulphur fertilization level increased the number of branches per plant compared with the lowest nitrogen fertilization at the same sulphur rate. Camelina seed yield increased with increasing nitrogen doses at the same low sulphur level, whereas straw yield increased only at the highest rate of nitrogen. Thousand-seed mass increased at the highest nitrogen dose and with the low sulphur application rate. In addition, the increase in nitrogen fertilization reduced seed oil content from 39.8% to 37.1%. A highly negative correlation was observed between oil and protein content of seeds. Nitrogen fertilization increased total oil yield and total protein yield. Differences in crop parameters between the sulphur treatments were not significant statistically, although the higher sulphur treatment tended to increase seed yield as well as oil and protein content compared with the low sulphur treatment. Thus, the combined application of N and S as mineral fertilizers is only recommended when growing camelina on sulphur-deficient soils if the aim is to achieve both high oil and protein production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present review summarizes the available data on the concentration of trace elements (TEs) in soils and their availability to plants with a view to reflect the quality and safety of food and fodder crops. Most soils in western Balkan countries are not contaminated. However, soils around industrial centers and historical mining sites do create concern for food and feed safety. Also high concentrations of TEs are related to their geochemical original. For example, ultrabasic rocks and serpentinites in western Serbia and western Bosnia are very rich in chromium, nickel, magnesium, iron (Fe), and cobalt, and cover an area of 5200 km2. High TE concentrations caused by anthropogenic activities are also reported. In vineyard soils in Croatia, concentrations of cadmium, copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) were much higher than their background concentrations. On the other hand, TE deficiency in plants is also prevalent in the regions. For example, Zn and Fe deficiencies in eastern parts of Croatia and northern parts of Serbia, Cu deficiency in pasture and sheep's blood at Nisici Plateau of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and selenium (Se) deficiency almost in the whole region have been observed. Therefore, information on TEs' behavior and soil factors affecting their mobility and availability is highly needed in order to separate the areas of contamination and then propose agrotechnical measures to protect the entry of TEs into the food chain. Research is also required to assess the influence of agronomic management on TE supply to plants and for achieving a better utilization of essential TEs. Concentrations of Se in wheat in Serbia are so low that if people were fed exclusively with wheat, their daily requirements for Se would not be met. There is also a need for full implementation of new food safety regulations in the Balkan countries in accordance with the legislations of the European Union.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The choice of prospective type of farming requires knowledge about the specific relationships that exist between farm management practices and base environmental conditions. Nowadays the protection of soil organic carbon is one of the main tasks, because organic carbon in addition to soil fertility can act in elimination of soil contamination and carbon sequestration. Field experiments were focused on the effect of intensive farming without organic inputs versus grassland on organic carbon content. Organic carbon content (Cox) and humic substance fractions (C-humic acids and fulvic acid fractions), hot water extractable carbon and selected microbial characteristics in Eutric Cambisol were monitored during the period 1999–2010. A priming effect of soil cultivation was detected immediately after tillage. Arable soil with 'intensive' crop sequences (exclusively cash crops, cereals, oil plants) and with an optimal level of chemical inputs (mineral fertilizers, pesticides), but without organic farmyard manure had lower content of all carbon forms compared with grassland. 13C NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis (TGA) were applied to characterize humic acid (HA) structure and stability. More carbon, less oxygen and more aromatic compounds were detected in grassland HA. Slight differences were found in HA thermo-oxidative stability and degradability, which was probably caused by changes in elemental composition and structure. Even the land use had no significant effect on basic microbiological characteristics (basal respiration, microbial biomass and qCO2); the physiology of the microbial community of grassland was altered by a higher ability to utilize L- and D-glutamic acid. The L/D ratio of glutamic acid mineralization indicated no occurrence of stress in soil for both types of farming. It has been demonstrated that although losses of carbon as a result of land-use conversions are generally more rapid, gains of carbon in grassland followed by changes in management practices can also occur.",

Plant development was observed as leaf:stem ratio (LSR) and standardised development stage, and dry matter yield (DMY) and digestibility were studied throughout two consecutive harvest seasons (2007 and 2008) as an effect of taking the first cut at four maturity stages (MSs), namely: (1) vegetative growth, (2) early heading, (3) heading and (4) anthesis, and then consecutive cuts throughout the season. Observations were made at two locations in Norway (61°N, 67°N). LSR and standardised development stage were affected by MSs and the loloid types of ×Festulolium (Felopa and the candivars) grouped between the parental species as to developmental pattern. The most extreme changes across MSs 1–4 in first cut were seen in the festucoid type Hykor (smallest) and in timothy (largest). Across MSs 2 and 3, for two years Hykor obtained higher DMY than the other entries, but overall digestible DMY was equal in Hykor and LpFp-T due to the better digestibility in LpFp-T. The lower DMY obtained in×Festulolium Felopa, the diploid candivars and LmFp-T was mainly due to winter damages. Consistency was found between the locations for the entries investigated. For Nordic growing conditions, in which winter hardiness is required for commercial cultivars, the amphitetraploid breeding approach of perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue should be pursued. It is the parental origin of the candivar LpFp-T, which was comparable to Hykor, the best of the commercial×Festulolium cultivars, and performed better than the cultivars of the parental species.",

However, the transferability of this technique from laboratory study to field application is complicated by soil moisture effects. This study aims to compare the performance of four spectral transformation strategies, namely, Savitzky–Golay (SG) smoothing, SG smoothing followed by first derivative (FD), orthogonal signal correction (OSC), and generalized least squares weighting (GLSW), in the removal of soil moisture effects on TN estimation. The spectral transformations were applied on 8 sets of spectral reflectance measured from 62 soil samples at 8 moisture levels. The air-dried set was used for partial least squares regression (PLSR) calibration, whereas the other seven sets with moisture gradients were used for external validations. Results show that the SG-PLSR model cannot be transferred from the air-dried samples to the samples with moisture gradients. The FD-PLSR model showed fair TN prediction performance, with five out of seven residual prediction deviations (RPD) that are greater than 1.4. Both OSC-PLSR and GLSW-PLSR had good transferability to the moist samples. More specifically, the GLSW-PLSR model (mean of , root mean square error for prediction [RMSEP] = 0.262, and RPD = 1.885) outperformed the OSC-PLSR model (mean of , RMSEP = 0.277, and RPD = 1.780). The results demonstrate the value of OSC and GLSW in eliminating the effects of moisture on TN estimation, and the GLSW-PLSR is recommended for a better Vis/NIR estimation of TN content under different soil moisture conditions.",

The influence of biochar on the microbial community has been reported, but its mechanism modifying soil microbial distribution is less understood. In this paper, biochar was physically separated from soil, and the abiotic characteristics generally recognised influencing soil microbial communities were examined. The microbial community structure was assessed via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The influence of abiotic components including available N, Olsen P and extractable K, pH and C/N induced by biochar on soil microbial communities was compared by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Results indicated that biochar fostered more fungi and stimulated bacteria growth in the adjacent soil. Biochar particles at three sampling times exhibited the similar microbial community composition, although it was also impacted by temporal factors. Phylogenetic distributions of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) could be divided into the following eight groups: Bacillaceae, Gemmatinomadetes, Sphingomanas, Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexaceae, Actibacteria (similarity > 95%) and unknown (similarity < 85%). CCA revealed the great contribution of C/N, Olsen P and extractable K to fungi growth, and C/N and Olsen P to actinomycete abundance. The presence of biochar not only induced increase of available nutrients but also increased microbial biomass and diversity, which indicated beneficial effects on soil microorganisms and soil fertility.",

    "abstract": "Sulfide-bearing anoxic sediments are found in coastal regions around the world including Australia and the Baltic. Upon lowering of the groundwater by drainage, they are oxidized and form acid sulfate soils (pH < 4) that mobilize plenty of potentially toxic metals into watercourses with serious environmental consequences. Being highly valued for their excellent crop yields, there is an urgent need to find management solutions that minimize the oxidation. In this study, possibilities to manage the groundwater with controlled subsurface drainage (CD) and subsurface irrigation (CDI), which included a vertical plastic sheet to prevent by-pass flow into the main drain, was examined on a Boreal farmland in Western Finland. During a 3-year study, the groundwater in the reference field (Ref) with conventional subsurface drainage pipes at 1.1–1.4 m depth typically dropped down to almost 2 m in the end of summers (September) due to evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation. CD delayed the groundwater drop, shortening the time of oxidation. In CDI system, the groundwater could be kept at c. 1 m or shallower throughout the summers, thereby preventing oxidation of critical sulfide horizons in the lower subsoil. Differences in total discharge and soil geochemistry features were small during the course of the study period. Salt accumulation seemed to be a small risk for crop growth but the capillary rise of acidity to the surface horizon may be increased in CDI, possibly increasing the need for surface liming. A \"floating groundwater antenna,\" indicating groundwater fluctuations, proved to be an easy and reliable tool to farmers for proper management of controlled drainage.",

    "abstract": "Predicting carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization of plant residues returned to soils is vital for foreseeing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere and soil nitrogen availability. Similarly, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important factor in forecasting microbial degradation of organic inputs as it represents the most active organic fraction, both biologically and chemically. In this study, an incubation experiment was conducted to investigate C and N mineralization and DOM potentials of residues of peanut (green manure, GM) and rice (rice straw, RS) at moisture regimes 50% (W1) and 100% (W2) of water holding capacity and temperature T1 (25°C) and T2 (35°C). The incorporation of plant residues significantly (P < 0.05) increased the mineralization and DOM, compared to controls. We observed that though GM residue had high carbon and nitrogen and DOM potential, but because of low C:N ratio and lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses compounds were vulnerable to easy decomposition with the increase in temperature, which led to more CO2 emission, fast mineralization, and less net OM in the soil. Conversely, RS residue, due to high C:N ratio, lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses compounds was resistant to decompose with the increase in temperature and possessed slow mineralization and eventually low CO2 emission. The moisture regimes (W1 and W2) and temperature (T1 and T2) had significant (P < 0.05) effect on mineralization and DOM potentials of both plant residues. The significant decrease and increase in the mineralization and DOM potential of both plant residues was observed with the increase in moisture and temperature. Our results suggest that plant residues with high C:N ratio, lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses compounds like RS are resistant to decompose with the increase in temperature, as a result possessed slow decomposition and mineralization, and can be used as an eco-friendly organic amendment, to get enduring benefits, and to mitigate the problem of carbon losses and CO2 emission from soil to atmosphere.",

The X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that nTiO2 powder corresponds to anatase phase. On agar medium only high concentrations of nTiO2 (10% and 20% w/w) induced significant inhibition of shoot growth. However, hydroponics treatment with nTiO2 up to 1000 mg L−1 did not show any adverse effect on the shoot growth. In both experiments, (i) root growth inhibition effects became visible with increasing concentration of nTiO2, (ii) plants treated with nTiO2 showed no change in chlorophyll a and b content, even though the plants absorbed nTiO2, (iii) weight of biomass treated with nTiO2 was not significantly different compared to control. Therefore, we assume that transport of nTiO2 into the aerial parts is limited due to the presence of effective mechanical or physiological barriers in roots. Overall, it appears that early root growth is a relevant indicator of potential effects of nTiO2 exposure. Our results also indicate that synthesized nTiO2 are not significantly toxic to the barley when applied at the concentrations used in this work, even though plants absorb titanium.",

These areas are of great interest when river catchment managers seek to both reduce nutrient loads to lakes and marine areas and to allow intensive agriculture. If HRAs were farmed with decreased inputs of fertilizers the environmental benefit would be larger here than from any other areas, and if LRAs were farmed with increased fertilizer use it could be done here causing less environmental damage than at any other areas. If both these changes were applied within the same catchment they might counter balance each other and give the possibility of intensified farming without causing environmental deterioration. We used the semi-distributed SWAT model to identify both HRAs and LRAs in an intensely farmed lowland catchment in Denmark. These areas are classified as the 10% of the agricultural area leaching, respectively, the most and the least nitrogen. Two scenarios were run for HRAs (reduced fertilizer input by 20%) and LRAs (increased fertilizer input by 20%) separately and two were run where both HRAs and LRAs were included. The scenario results showed that the HRA scenario yielded a decrease (3.3%) in nitrate river load at the catchment scale and that the LRA scenario yielded only a small increase (0.9%). The combined scenarios showed an overall decrease in river nitrate load (2.2%).",

In this study, we investigated the 16-year effects of this mulch on soil physicochemical properties (total organic C, N and P; bulk density; Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and Zn; soil texture; pH), microbial biomass C, N and P and enzymatic activities (peroxidase, dehydrogenase, invertase, β-glucosidase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase and urease) in a field trial in China's Gaolan County. We examined how these parameters changed after 7, 11 and 16 years of mulching. After 16 years, soil bulk density and sand content increased significantly. Soil Ca and Cu contents did not change significantly during the study period, but Fe, Mg, Mn and Zn contents all decreased significantly after 16 years. The total N increased significantly after 11 years, but total C and N both decreased dramatically and significantly after 16 years (by 22% and 13%, respectively, compared to the control). The mulch significantly increased microbial biomass C (by 29% after 11 years), with similar results for N and P, but these positive effects were lost after 16 years. Enzyme activities revealed changes in the soil microbial community over time; the mulch increased enzyme activities until 11 years, followed by a significant decrease that suggested degradation of soil quality after long-term mulching. The positive effects of the mulch (increasing soil temperature) could explain the high microbial biomass and enzyme activities after 11 years. However, long-term increases in soil bulk density and sand content (caused by mixing of the mulch layer with the surface soil) and a lack of inputs of organic matter (caused by the barrier created by the mulch layer) led to degradation of the soil after 16 years.",

Despite regulatory efforts to ensure safe use, reports have indicated that residual amounts of pesticides and their metabolites occur in surface and ground water and may have non-target effects on aquatic organisms. The objective of the present study was to identify environmental challenges of pesticide use in the northern climate by evaluating long-term pesticide monitoring data compiled by the Norwegian Agricultural Environmental Monitoring Programme. Pesticide use data and pesticide concentrations measured in stream water from six small agricultural catchments in Norway were analysed. Observed trends in pesticide detection frequencies, measured concentrations and cumulative risk from the six monitoring sites were compared. The results demonstrated the need for continued focus on the herbicides metribuzin and aclonifen, and potential concerns regarding use of the fungicide prothioconazole and the insecticide imidacloprid. The six monitoring sites represented the diversity of intensively cropped areas in Norway and differed with respect to estimated cumulative risk. Vegetable and potato cropping areas showed not only the highest level of total environmental risk, but also a statistically significant decreasing trend over the monitoring period. Cereal cropping areas exhibited no statistically significant time-dependent trends in the studied parameters but did show an increase in fungicide use that requires continued attention. The need for risk assessment of mixture toxicity effects and improved monitoring strategy is also discussed. In conclusion, the present results imply that the current global focus on multiple stressors and mixture toxicity of pesticides in stream water is equally relevant in cold climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, potato early blight [Alternaria solani (Ellis & G. Martin) L.R. Jones, A lternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl.] has occurred with increasing frequency in European potato fields, including those in northern regions. In our study, early blight was evaluated during the two years 2010–2011 on potato plants in a conventional farming experiment. Both growing seasons were very favourable for early blight development and evaluation. Our study indicates that, despite chemical treatments, potato early blight is a great problem for potato growers in conventional farming systems in the North-East region in years when temperatures are higher than average. In 2011, early blight damage was particularly high on the untreated (N0P0K0) treatment plots where severity increased abruptly from an initial 2% to 91%, and killed the potato haulms within five weeks. In 2010, the most severely infected plants were also recorded on the untreated (N0P0K0) plots, where 70% of foliage was destroyed by the end of the growing season. Results showed that a more efficient chemical strategy is needed against this disease on susceptible cultivars. Breeding and growing more resistant cultivars of potato is considered the most efficient, cost effective and environmentally friendly control method for sustainable cultivation in conventional growing systems. As an increase in the frequency of warmer summers is predicted, greater problems from this pathogen are to be expected in Northern Europe.",

Plant growth (plant height and stem), water relations (relative water content), gas exchange (net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate) and nutrient levels were measured after 5, 10, 15 and 20 days of drought with different soil water availability. We found that all these physiological traits were inhibited by drought stress, but they showed differing levels of sensitivity with different soil water availability. Our results show that stomatal conductance was the most sensitive in mild drought conditions, that carbon accumulation was more sensitive than the other parameters in moderate drought, and that height and stem showed the largest response ratio in severe drought conditions. Different traits performed differently under drought conditions; thus, choosing an adequate index for evaluating soil water availability is necessary for maize cultivation.",

In this study, the mineral composition of 120 soil samples included in the national monitoring of agricultural soils of Finland was determined using state-of-the-art quantitative x-ray diffraction analysis by a prior measured full pattern fitting methodology. Quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspar were found to be the dominant soil mineral components. Amphiboles and micas were also common, and several other mineral phases were detected in small quantities. The relative proportions of quartz and plagioclases increased and those of mica, goethite, disordered clay minerals, kaolin and amorphous inorganic components decreased as the soil particle size increased. Compositional statistical analysis discerned a positive association between the prevalence of 12 elements and organic matter and surface-active minerals (goethite, chlorite, disordered clays, kaolin and inorganic amorphous materials), whereas micas contributed to the prevalence of K. The present data agreed with general conceptions of Finnish soil mineralogy but revealed novel details in the mineral composition. The relationship observed between soil textural and mineral compositions supports the current texture-based soil classification system and recommendations.",

Large variations were also found in the flour, dough and bread parameters measured, especially for parameters which could be related to the arabinoxylan content and arabinoxylan degrading enzymes. Correlations were found between the falling number of the flours, viscosity decrease during the swelling curve test, softening factor of the doughs and percentage decrease of the dough storage modulus, all related to the activity of endogenous hydrolytic enzymes. Notable differences in crumb properties (firmness, elasticity and stickiness) were found in the breads baked from five different whole‐meal flours.

With N-min values ranging from 22 to 162 kg N ha -1 at carrot emergence, the N uptake of the carrot crop increased linearly from 70 to 200 kg N ha -1 . The yield increased with N-min at lower levels of N, but levelled off above 90-100 kg N ha -1 . In fresh carrot roots the concentrations of total N, ten individual amino acids, total sum of amino acids, two amides, asparagine and glutamine, and g -carotene increased linearly with the soil concentration of N-min at carrot emergence. Nitrate N increased exponentially with N-min, reaching levels of 340 mg NO 3 kg -1 fresh weight under some conditions. The concentrations of potassium, calcium, glucose, fructose, sucrose and six individual free amino acids were unaffected by the N-min level. Magnesium was decreased at the lowest deliberately depleted N-min levels, whereas the concentration of dry matter and vitamin C decreased linearly with increasing N-min levels. Significantly lower concentrations of dry matter, total N, nitrate N, vitamin C and total sum of free amino acids were found in the warm and sunny year 1995 with the highest yield of carrot roots, whereas the contrary was found for g -carotene.

The Vreta Kloster soil, classified as a very fine, mixed, semiactive Oxyaquic Haplocryoll, according to the Soil Taxonomy and as a Haplic Phaeozem according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), consisted of very dark greyish brown silty clay overlying a subsoil of heavy clay (70–80%). Porosity increased with depth due to a greater micro- but not macro-pore volume. Stocks of C and N amounted to 76.4 t C ha−1 and 8.7 t N ha−1 in the Ap-horizon and 24.8 t C ha−1 and 3.25 t N ha−1 in the subsoil to 1 m depth. Soil pH increased with depth, 6.6 to 7.4, and CEC values ranged 25 to 31 cmolc kg−1 soil. The main clay minerals were illite/mica (45%) followed by vermiculite (9–20%). Chlorite and kaolinite amounted to 2% throughout the profile. In dry years, crop production at the Vreta Kloster site was greatly reduced, which can be attributed to the absence of macro-pores and high portion of micro-pores and in the subsoil reducing the amount of water available to crops. The Högåsa profile, classified as a sandy mixed Humic Dystrocryept according to the Soil Taxonomy and as Arenic Umbrisol according WRB, consisted of loamy very fine and fine sand. Soil pH and bulk density increased with depth from 5.7 to 6.5 and 1.3 to 1.6 kg dm−3, respectively. Carbon and N stocks amounted to 72.3 t C ha−1 and 5.9 t N ha−1 in the Ap-horizon and were low in the subsoil, 13.5 t C ha−1 and 1.1 t N ha−1. Clay mineralogy was dominated by illite/mica (26–50%) with vermiculite being formed in the Ap-horizon. Chlorite amounted to 3–6% and kaolinite to 2–3% in the profile. Crop yields were less affected by rainfall conditions and leys were more productive at Högåsa than Vreta Kloster. A high mechanical resistance reducing root penetration of the subsoil and a low nutrient content limited crop production at Högåsa.",

As far as is known, some plants are strongly mycorrhizal dependent for P nutrition, but less is known about the mycorrhizal dependence with Zn nutrition. Hypotheses were tested under P and Zn deficient soils to find out whether kidney bean plants are mycorrhizal dependent or not. Kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) plants were grown for 8 weeks in two widely distributed calcareous clay soils with low nutrient content from Central Anatolian Sultanönü and Konya soils (sterilized by autoclaving). The experiment was conducted with three levels of phosphorus (0, 25, 125 mg P kg−1 soil), and two rates of Zn (0 and 5 mg Zn kg−1soil) Two selected arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) species (Glomus mosseae and G. etunicatum) were inoculated. In the Sultanönü soil, mycorrhizal inoculation increased plant growth and P and Zn uptake. The positive effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant P content and uptake was found to be higher when higher levels of phosphorus were applied. The soil from Konya with a high concentration of boron inhibited normal growth of kidney bean plants. Mycorrhizal root colonization was different with mycorrhizal inoculation. Root colonization was not affected by P and Zn application, but it has been shown that the plant is strongly dependent on P nutrition, especially at low P application levels. However, although mycorrhizal inoculation increased plant concentration of Zn, plants were less dependent on Zn nutrition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is cultivated mainly on saline soils. Low levels of salinity stimulate growth of this crop plant possibly due to production of broader leaves as sources of assimilates. In this work, six cultivars were studied under mild salinity (EC = 5.5 dS m−1) in a field experiment to analyse its effect on growth parameters and yield of storage root and sugar accumulation. An attempt was also made to determine the contributing role of photosynthetic gas exchange in response of sugar beet plants to salinity. Production of greater leaf area in salinized plants occurred only transitionally in the early growth period; in progression of the growing season it was decreased, and at 3rd harvest (100 days after treatment) it was significantly lower compared with control plants without cultivar differences. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, net photosynthesis rate, and stomatal conductance did not change by salinity significantly. Although, at the end of growth season, leaf area and potential photosynthesizing component of salinized plants on the basis of leaf area (LAR) or weight (LWR) were significantly lower than for control plants, weight of storage root and sugar content were up to 90 and 37% higher than in control plants, respectively. Consequently, a considerable higher yield under mild salinity conditions in sugar beet is not attributable to higher leaf area or, therefore, higher photosynthetic capacity of whole plants. Indeed, the storage roots benefit from lower dry matter and surface production of shoot during the late growing season (because of lower nitrogen assimilation and a slight drought stress of salinized plants) and a change in dry-matter partitioning in favor of roots takes place. However, a possible special effect of Na on carbon allocation for storage and structure and involvement of growth regulators in the change of root-shoot allometry could not be excluded.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the variability of soil properties and their effects on crop yield is a critical component of site-specific management systems. The objective of this study was to employ factor and multiple regression analyses to determine major soil physical and chemical properties that influence barely biomass and grain yield within a field in the arid region of northern Iran. For this purpose, soil samples and crop-yield data were collected from 108 sites, at regular intervals (20×30 m) in a 5.6 ha field. Soil samples were analysed for total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (Pava), available potassium (Kava), cation-exchange capacity(CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, mean weight diameter of aggregates (MWD), water-stable aggregates (WSA), field capacity volumetric (FC), available water-holding capacity (AWHC), bulk density (BD), and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE). Results of the factor analysis, followed by regression of biomass and grain yield of barley with soil properties, showed that the regression equations developed accounted for 78 and 73% of the total variance in biomass and grain yield, respectively. Study of covariance analysis among soil variables using factor analysis indicated that some of the variation measured could be grouped to indicate a number of underlying common factors influencing barley biomass and grain yields. These common factors were salinity and sodicity, soil fertility, and water availability. The most effective soil variables to barley production in the study area identified as EC, SAR, pH, TN, Pava, AWHC, and FC. In this study, factor analysis was effective to identify the groups of correlated soil variables that were significantly correlated with the within field variability in the yield of the barley crop. Our results also suggest that the approach can be applied to other crops under similar soil and agroclimatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The weight of the tractor is not the only factor affecting soil compaction. Soil-management practices, such as the use of fertilizers and pesticides, also affect soil properties through an increased number of overriding. The aim of the current study was to investigate compaction effects on soil physical properties, such as dry bulk density and penetration resistance, and the growth of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) as a monoculture. The five-year experiment was conducted on the Estonian University of Life Sciences' research field at Eerika, near Tartu in 2001–2005. The soil of the experimental site is sandy loam Stagnic Luvisol. The treatments included were no compaction, one pass, three passes, and six passes. All passes were track-by-track. Measurements of soil and plant were made in the earing phase of barley and measurements of yield in the maturity phase of barley. The compaction treatment was conducted using an MTZ-82 tractor (total weight 4.84 Mg). Neither fertilizers nor herbicides were used. 5 years after compaction distinguishable subsoil and topsoil compaction was detected. Soil deformation increases with the number of passes; in the case of six passes soil bulk density increased by 0.15 Mg m−3 and penetration resistance by 3 MPa. However, there were no significant differences in the soil bulk density and penetration resistance between treatments compacted with one and three passes. The effect of compaction on soil bulk density was higher when the soil was compacted under wet conditions. Compaction decreased the quantity of barley shoots, their phytomass, and grain yield by more than 80%. In the second year of the experiment the dry weight of above ground biomass decreased by almost three times and shoots' density by 1.5 times, compared with the first year results. In the third year of the experiment the biomass, plant density, and grain yield of barley were stabilized and no further decreases were detected in the following two experimental years. The results from the experiment revealed that even a low weight tractor can induce subsoil compaction and a high decrease of plant productivity by repeated passes over time.",

Across all treatments, carbon accumulation in belowground organs in the top 20 cm was on average 3 and 3.4 Mg C by the end of the second and third year, respectively, with roots and rhizomes accounting for up to 80%. Roots contributed most to belowground C mass during the second growing season but during the preceding winter, root biomass C decreased by 44–67%, and, thereafter, during the third growing season, the proportion of rhizome C increased. The dynamics of root biomass was considerably high, suggesting high root turnover rates. Rhizomes support re-growth during spring and rhizome biomass seems to increase with crop age. Thus, early harvesting before October may impact on the productivity during the following season. Among the factors studied, harvest date was the most influential and affected C allocation in all crop components considerably. Fertilization stimulated growth of shoots, rhizomes, and BSBs (belowground shoot bases) but not that of roots. However, root biomass was higher in the organic than in the mineral soil. In this study, we considered only plant components above 20 cm depth. More detailed studies are needed to calculate more complete soil C balances. However, high belowground biomass production and root turnover indicate a high C input to the soil, which may result in positive soil C balances. Therefore, RCG cropping could have considerable carbon-sequestration potential.",

In greenhouse experiments, we used two different composts mixed with peat (20% + 80%) and pure peat as growth substrates in growing pots. In each substrate, treatments were: (A) with R. solani and nematodes, (B) with R. solani, (C) with nematodes, (D) control without R. solani or nematodes. Treatment effects were measured as percentage of healthy seedlings 7, 10 and 14 days after start of the experiment. We conducted two different experiments with the treatments A–D; one with Aphelenchoides spp. and one with Aphelenchus avenae. Aphelenchoides spp.+R. solani (treatment A) had 85% healthy plants (= control without addition of fungi (D)) compared with 45% in R. solani without nematodes (B). Aphelenchus avenae suppressed damping-off significantly in all substrates, from almost 100% dead plants in peat with R. solani to 65% healthy plants in R. solani+A. avenae. One compost mixture had an intrinsic suppressive effect on damping-off, while plant health in the other compost mixture was not better than in 100% peat as growing substrate. There were no additive suppressive effects (enhancement) between nematode effects and the suppressive compost. The results demonstrate the ability of fungivorous nematodes to suppress plant diseases. The effects of fungivorous nematodes in combination with compost and other control measures on disease suppression need further attention. The usefulness of fungivorous nematodes in agriculture and horticulture is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Yams (Dioscorea spp.) are known to be very demanding in terms of soil fertility. The influence of deleterious soil fertility on the growth of yams, however, has not yet been studied. A field study was carried out in Côte d'Ivoire, in a fertile forest site and in a low fertility savanna site, submitted to identical climatic conditions, to determine how soil fertility affects Leaf Area Index, Leaf Area Ratio, Crop Growth Rate, Tuber Bulking Rate, Radiation Interception, Radiation Use Efficiency and final tuber yields in D. alata and D. rotundata, grown in the presence of adequate fertilizers. While germination and establishment of both species were not affected by the site, growth parameters of D. alata were superior to those of D. rotundata. This resulted in higher yields of D. alata, when compared to D. rotundata. Only the radiation use efficiency was higher in D. rotundata than in D. alata. Both species reached higher Crop growth rate and Tuber bulking rate and produced higher fresh tuber yields at the forest site than at the savanna site, reflecting the known demand of yams for high fertility soil. Correlation analyses showed significant relationships between the mean Leaf Area Index measured over the entire growth period, Tuber Growth Rate calculated between tuber initiation and harvest, and fresh tuber yields, suggesting that the development of leaf area is determining the growth rate of the tuber which itself determines the fresh tuber yield. The decrease in D. alata tuber yields at the savanna site was explained by a decrease in Leaf Area Index, while the decrease in D. rotundata tuber yields at this site was explained by a decrease in Radiation Use Efficiency. Both effects might have been the consequence of a suboptimal nitrogen and potassium nutrition at the savanna site.",

The effects on weed seed bank, weed growth and grain yield of 4 years of annual undersown clover and ryegrass alone and in combination, and one of the 4 years with clover or clover + grass as green manure, were studied in oat and spring wheat at two experimental sites in south-eastern Norway. These treatments were compared with no undersown crop (control) and with weed harrowing. In contrast to many results in the literature, the undersown clover in this study did not suppress annual weeds, but fertilized the weeds as well as the cereals. Undersown clover resulted in a statistically significant increase of grain yield at the two sites to 116% and 121% of control. During the 4-year period relative seed bank and density of emerged weed (dominated by Spergula arvensis) increased significantly about 4.5 and 10 times respectively in the undersown clover plots at Apelsvoll. At Kise both ryegrass alone and ryegrass mixed with clover significantly suppressed the weed biomass to 70% and 74% of control respectively. It is concluded that fertilization effects of undersown clover may have dominated and overriden the competitive effects. One whole-season clover green manure did not increase the mean yield, but resulted in a significant drop in seed bank size the following year, because of limited weed establishment in an established ley. Only a slight increase in average weed biomass was observed at one of the two experimental sites. The weed seed bank and the weed biomass were essentially kept at steady state during the experimental period in harrowed plots, but harrowing decreased grain yield significantly at both sites.",

The aim of this study was to quantify the role of increasing drought on weed-induced crop losses and crop–weed interactions for processing tomato grown in southern Italy. Field experiments were carried out during 2008 and 2009. Two levels of water availability were imposed to compare weed competitive effects under irrigated and rainfed conditions on tomato as a means to quantify weed–crop interactions and associated crop losses when water is limited. In this study, the absolute decline in tomato yields by weed interference was a direct function of water applied (rain + irrigation); however, the relative effect of weed biomass on crop loss appeared to increase under drought when compared to irrigated conditions. Overall, these data indicate that the relative decline in tomato fresh weight from weeds was actually greater under drought, and that the relative crop losses (per unit of weed biomass) actually declined as water availability increased. From a management standpoint, these data suggest that if drought occurrences do increase in the Mediterranean region with climate change, there may be a greater need for complete and thorough weed control for this production system.",

    "abstract": "Growing concern about issues surrounding climate change and the environment has led to a recent focus on local food strategies and a change in consumer buying behaviour towards food in the European Union (EU). Accordingly, there has been an increasing demand for foods from local and regional sources as well as from sustainable production regimes. Although this trend seems to be driven primarily by household consumption, public food procurement has also begun to adopt this idea and has taken on a new and more critical view on its sourcing strategies. Such food strategies seem to offer benefits for local farmers and food processors. At the same time, they may also offer opportunities to develop new educational and health-promoting links between the actors of public food systems, such as young people in schools, and farmers. This contribution to “quality of life” is often referred to as social innovation. This is primarily because it improves social capital by bringing together new actors to address important societal challenges. Achieving sustainable school food systems is considered a challenge, and research-based knowledge is in demand in relation to multi-component interventions. This perspective article reports on early insights from a pilot case within the local food project LOMA-Nymarkskolen in Svendborg (DK). The findings of this project are used to evaluate whether local food strategies are an effective method of social innovation. The pilot case is a whole school, workshop and curriculum-based intervention in which 6th-grade students participate in cooking their own school food for one week using products from local farms. Data from the pilot case indicate that local food strategies help establish new educational links between schools and local producers and thereby contribute to students' food literacy, health and quality of life in a way that qualifies to the notion of social innovation.",

    "abstract": "Soil loss by erosion is a major threat to European soil resources. It is linked to most other threats to soils and is estimated to incur substantial costs to society. To monitor and evaluate soil erosion comprehensively, measurements and modelled estimates of soil loss by erosion need to integrate water, wind and tillage erosion, as these are common throughout Europe. Tolerable rates of soil erosion (thresholds) in Europe can be set equal to estimated soil formation rates, that is, ~1 t ha−1 yr−1, but defining this threshold will require further research in the context of soil functions. There is a strong need for improving the knowledge base of current erosion rates, especially to develop and validate reliable erosion prediction models. This should include depositional environments (e.g. flood plains) where greater erosion rates than those on hill slopes may be tolerable, depending on the consequent effects on all relevant ecosystem goods and services provided by soil. Moreover, in considering erosion at catchment (watershed) level, the distance between erosion sites and areas of deposition should be taken into account.",

Field experiments were conducted in 2008 and 2009 at three experimental sites, Kristianstad, Skara and Västerås, at increasing latitudes from 55°–60° N. Experimental design used two replicated randomized complete blocks at each site with three maize hybrids, Avenir (FAO 180), Isberi (FAO 190) and Burli (FAO 210), which were continuously assessed for plant development and harvested at various levels of maturity. The chemical composition and nutritional characteristics of harvested plant materials were analysed and hybrid responses to advancing maturity in terms of yield and nutritional qualities were evaluated. Results showed that maize hybrids required different numbers of accumulated thermal units at sites on varying latitudes to achieve developmental stages. Lowest thermal unit requirements among hybrids were observed for hybrid Avenir, and for sites it was highest for plants grown in the most northern site, Västerås. The most southern site, Kristianstad, was the only site at which all hybrids reached the dent stage (c. 450 g kg−1 kernel DM), a recommended maturity for ensiling. The DM yields of early maturing hybrid Avenir were consistently lower than those for Isberi and Burli at all the sites. Results also revealed nutritional differences among maize hybrids at a given maturity (DM, g kg−1), indicating that the effects of maturation should be factored into design of hybrid performance trials. This study highlights the effects of marginal site conditions and hybrids on plant development, agronomic performance and nutritional characteristics of maize hybrids at high latitudes. Further studies on marginal sites are recommended to enlighten the understanding of interaction between environmental and genetic factors on the performance of forage maize.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) is adapted to tolerate severe drought and high irradiance levels. Relative electron transport rate (J), photosynthetic efficiency (in terms of F v /F m and ΦPSII), photochemical (qP) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were determined in 2-year old olive plants (cultivars 'Coratina' and 'Biancolilla') grown under two different light levels (exposed plants, EP, and shaded plants, SP) during a 21-day controlled water deficit. After reaching pre-dawn leaf water potentials of about -6.5 MPa, plants were rewatered for 23 days. During the experimental period, measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were carried out to study the photosynthetic performance of olive plants. The effect of drought stress and high irradiance levels caused a reduction of gas exchange, J, ΦPSII and F v/F m and this decrease was more marked in EP. Under drought stress, EP showed a higher degree of photoinhibition, a higher NPQ and a lower qP if compared to SP. Coratina was more sensitive to high light and drought stress and had a slower recovery during rewatering. The results confirm that photoprotection is an important factor that affects photosynthetic productivity in olive, and that the degree of this process varies between the cultivars. This information could give a more complete picture of the response of olive trees grown under stressful conditions of semi-arid environments, and could be important for the selection of drought-tolerant cultivars with a high productivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Loess Plateau of China suffers serious soil erosion primarily resulting from irrational land uses. Soil water plays a critical role influencing vegetation-restoration processes, but varies with temporal and spatial characteristics, of concern to many researchers. However, few studies consider the influence of deep soil water and varied weather patterns in a semi-arid region. Four vegetation types chosen for this study include artificial caragana shrubland, artificial alfalfa grassland, naturally restored vegetation land (Artemisia capillaries, Agropyron chistatum, Heteropapus altaicus Novop, Stipa bungeana, Stipa breviflora griseb and Lespedeza davurica), and bare land. Soil-water content at the top 400 cm depth was monitored continuously from 2004 to 2007 using a neutron probe. Water and wind soil erosion were investigated gravimetrically. Results showed that soil water varied greatly during May through October with different land-use types and annual precipitations. Soil water reached a lower level in both artificial vegetation lands in dry years but recharged with great variation in normal years. Soil water in two other lands tended to have similar changes with less variation as compared with the artificial vegetation lands. Soil water was intensively consumed with depth and continuously decreased in the deeper layers under the two artificial vegetations. The consumption in the artificial caragana shrubland was more intensive, while that in the artificial alfalfa grassland took place at greater depths. The naturally restored vegetation land had less soil-water consumption (close to the level in the bare land) as compared with the artificial vegetation lands. Soil-water content and its variability were increased along the slope with less variation over time. In general, both artificial vegetations effectively reduced the runoff and water-wind soil erosion in the third year after planting, while the naturally restored vegetation consistently showed weak conservation effects in the initial stage.",

The parameters analysed were root and shoot biomass, nitrate concentration, and organic and total nitrogen as well as those defining nitrogen-use efficiency in plants: total nitrogen content, total nitrogen accumulation, nitrogen-uptake efficiency and nitrogen-utilization efficiency. In addition to decreasing shoot biomass, iodide treatments reduced leaf levels of nitrates, organic nitrogen, and total nitrogen content. Iodate treatments did not affect the concentration of nitrogen in its different forms. The application of iodide caused total nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen-uptake efficiency to decrease, iodate application improved the latter. Both iodide and iodate applications significantly improved nitrogen-utilization efficiency in comparison to the control. The results obtained show that iodate application rates of 40 µM or lower significantly improved all nitrogen parameters analysed, making it possible to increase lettuce productivity and quality.",

In covered whole-grain flours the summarized amount of phenolics (Σ-P) ranged from 481–676 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g dry matter (DM) and the corresponding total antioxidant activities (Σ-FRAP) between 6.1–8.7 mmol Fe3 +/100 g DM. About 50% of the phenolics in these samples were easily extractable (free). Upon pearling a general decrease in both Σ-P and Σ-FRAP was seen in the pearled samples, while the ratio between free and bound phenolics was similar or increased to those in the covered whole-grain samples. The hulls had the highest Σ-P and Σ-FRAP and were dominated by bound phenolics. Despite accounting for only 10–20% of the total grain weight, the hulls typically contributed to 45% of the total antioxidant capacity measured in the covered whole-grain flours. Pearling makes it possible to obtain barley fractions with different amounts of phenolics, different ratios of free and bound phenolics, and thus different antioxidant activities.",

The objective of this laboratory study was to assess the effects of soil crusts and tillage treatments on soil infiltration in the Loess Plateau of China. A simulated rainfall storm at 80 mm h−1 rate was applied to soil boxes set to slopes of 5°, 10°, 15° and 20° with two soil surface conditions (crusted and uncrusted) and three tillage treatments (contour tillage [CT], artificial digging [AD] and straight slope [SS]) to investigate the infiltration rates. The results show that the infiltration rate was always lower under the SS treatment than under the CT and AD treatments. The time interval to the steady state was shorter under the SS (10 min) than under the CT and AD treatments (15–20 min). The final infiltration rate was nearly the same under the CT treatment and AD treatment; whereas, the SS treatment resulted in the lowest final infiltration rate. The infiltration rates were always greater in soils without crusts than in soils with crusts. The slopes, soil crusts and tillage treatments had significant (p < 0.001) effects on the cumulative infiltration rates. The combined effects of the slopes and tillage treatments on the cumulative infiltration rates were much more significant (p < 0.01) than the other combined effects (p < 0.05).",

    "abstract": "Aloe vera L., commonly known as aloe, secures its position as one of the primary medicinal plants with multipurpose applications starting from pharmaceutical to cosmetic aspects with promising economic return. The plant was under threatened category due to its imprudent harvesting from wild as it is extensively used by medicinal industries for its clinical properties. It also faces problem with its conventional propagation system. The rapidity and success of propagation of aloe have constantly been a key concern for breeders and cultivators. In vitro culture is one of the few efficient techniques to triumph over these inherent intricacies. Over 200 multidisciplinary publications, mostly in the English language, were surveyed for the uses, useful properties, propagation, and biotechnological advancement of aloe. Starting from 1989 up till now, extensive research works have been performed on aloe tissue culture. Nevertheless, there is no review report available on in vitro culture of this plant. The present paper intends to present a comprehensive overview of the in vitro culture of such an important plant of diversified utilities. This article reviews advances made on various aspects of aloe tissue culture and micropropagation, including sterilization of explants, variety of explants sources, direct and indirect organogenesis, acclimatization, and fidelity assessment of in vitro regenerated clones. Since this is the first review on in vitro culture of aloe, it provides an exclusive and noteworthy resource and spring-board from which to commence or further studies associated to in vitro culture of aloe.",

    "abstract": "Given the numerous environmental problems caused by chemical fertilizer overuse, agricultural practices are shifting toward the development of environmentally friendly nitrogen (N) fertilizers. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of poly(γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA), an effective fertilizer synergist, on rapeseed (Brassica napus cv. Qinyou No. 9) productivity, soil N pools, and soil enzymes. Seven treatments were implemented: T1, a check without urea; T2, a check with urea only; T3, urea mixed with glutamic acid; T4, urea mixed with 3 mg of γ-PGA per kilogram of soil; T5, urea mixed with 10 mg of γ-PGA per kilogram of soil; T6, urea coated with γ-PGA (0.9%, m/m); and T7, urea coated with γ-PGA (3.1%, m/m). The results demonstrated that the application of γ-PGA increased the above-ground fresh weight of rapeseed by 7.57–9.26% and the grain yield per pot by 6.46–10.98% compared with T2. The rapeseed grain yield significantly increased from 15.94 ± 0.55 g pot−1 in T2 to 17.69 ± 0.78 g pot−1 in T7. With the increase in pod numbers and seed numbers per pod, the seed yield was significantly improved after γ-PGA application. Culturable soil microbial count and microbial diversity were increased by γ-PGA application. In addition, the effects of application method of γ-PGA have a more important role on the soil microflora than its amount. The reduced loss of N can be attributed to the capacity of γ-PGA to increase the \" turnover pool.\" More mineral N in the soil was immobilized by clays, soil microbes, and γ-PGA at the early growth stage, and the immobilized N was then released at the later growth stage for plant growth. Moreover, urease activity also increased with γ-PGA application. These findings indicated that the urea coated with γ-PGA could be a better choice for agricultural applications.",

The aim of this study was to characterise sorghum landraces and to select farmer-preferred medium-maturing genotypes under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Hundred and ninety-six sorghum accessions were evaluated at Kobo site of the Sirinka Agricultural Research Center in 2014/2015 in Ethiopia. Data collected from 14 traits were subjected to analysis of variance, cluster analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis, path coefficient analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Significant genotypic differences (p < 0.05) were observed. Medium-maturing and drought tolerant sorghum genotypes including E-72457, E-72438, E-72435, E-206214, E-72449, E-75460 and E-75458 with superior agronomic performance were recommend for large-scale production or for further breeding. The genotypes evaluated under rain-fed and irrigated conditions were grouped into five and six clusters, respectively, representing varied different heterotic groups. Grain yield had significant and positive correlation with yield-related traits assessed under the two test conditions. Further, path coefficient analysis revealed that days to maturity under rainfed condition and harvest index under irrigated condition had the highest positive direct effects on grain yield, therefore can be targets for direct selection. Overall, there was marked genetic diversity among the tested genotypes. Suitable medium-maturing farmers-preferred accessions selected from the study will be useful for effective breeding for drought tolerance and medium-maturity.",

The data showed that all the enzymes activities increased in plants treated with plant growth-promoting fungi (PGPF) compared with nontreated plants of both cultivars. The activities of endochitinase and β-1,3-endoglucanase were highly increased in PGPF-induced plants than in nontreated plants of both cultivars at different time points. Activities of PO, polyphenol oxidase, and PAL also increased between 3 and 6 days due to inoculation with PGPF and decreased thereafter. The activity of PAL at 9 days in PGPF-induced plants was at the same level as that of nontreated plants of both cultivars. Results of this investigation suggest that PGPF-induced systemic resistance is associated with not only high increases in the activities of chitinase and β-1,3-gluconases but also other plant defense-related enzymes such as PO, PPO, and PAL. Roles of other mechanisms rather than accumulation of defense-related enzymes in PGPF-mediated induced resistance in susceptible cultivars were demonstrated.",

(isolates GS8-1, GS8-2 and GS8-3) and non-sporulating fungus (isolate GU21-2) were tested for their ability to induce systemic resistance against Colletotrichum orbiculare in cucumber. These isolates, used as colonized barley kernels to natural soils, induced systemic resistance in the greenhouse as well as in the field. Different elicitors from PGPF such as cell walls retaining or lacking protein and lipids, cell walls lipid fraction, and three fractions of culture filtrate (CF) with different molecular weight ranges were tested for their ability to elicit the defense response of cucumber plants under controlled conditions. Cell wall fraction lacking protein and lipids and the cell wall lipid fraction from root colonizing isolates GS8-1, GS8-2, and GS8-3 protected plants against C. orbiculare. While, only cell wall lipid fraction and CF fractions of different molecular weight ranges of the isolate GU21-2 protected plants against C. orbiculare infection. Methanol-soluble substances from CF fractions with molecular weight greater than 12,000 and less than 8000 consistently protected plants against the pathogen. Germination of C. orbiculare spores decreased significantly at 72 h of incubation on leaves of PGPF-protected plants. Isolate GU21-2 was the most effective in inhibiting spore germination. On the other hand, isolates GS8-1 and GU21-2 induced lignifications in the hypocotyls of seven-day-old cucumber seedlings after challenge inoculation with C. orbiculare. Three-week-old cucumber plants treated with isolate GU21-2 and challenged with C. orbiculare showed increased activities of exo- and endo-forms of glucanase and chitinase, as well as peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in the second true leaves. Induction treatment with isolate GS8-1 also increased the activities of these enzymes with the exception of exo-glucanase.

Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) also showed that parasitic fungi of SCN were also increased in SSSS field, compared with the other two fields. Principal component analysis based on PCR-DGGE data revealed that fungal communities on cysts could be divided into three groups: one group occurred in SSSS, and the other two groups were in WCS and SSC fields, respectively. Long-term cropping with soybean monoculture in the black soil field might increase parasitic fungi of SCN. These fungal communities may play an important role in the ecological suppression of SCN in disease-suppressive soil.",

The plants were grown in a greenhouse on a Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system. Nitrogen concentrations in the nutrient solution were either 3 mM or 12 mM, and the form of N was varied as follows: 100% NO3, 50% NO3 + 50% NH4, and 100% NH4. In both seasons, the biomass (fresh weight) of lettuce heads increased with increasing NO3 concentrations and in autumn, NO3 even at 1.5 mM was sufficient for high yield. However, head dry weight was affected neither by the season nor by changes in the composition of the nutrient solution. The concentration of NO3 had no effect on root dry weight, but it decreased at higher concentrations of NH4. The number of leaves increased as the ratio of NO3 to NH4 in the nutrient solution increased and was higher in autumn because of the longer growth period. Increasing the concentration of NO3 in nutrient solution increased both total N and nitrate concentration in lettuce heads (dry weight) but decreased the concentration of total C. Also, leaf nitrate concentration was lower in spring than in autumn and decreased with increasing NH4 concentration. Nitrogen utilization efficiency was maximum when NH4 levels in the nutrient solution were either 0% or 50% irrespective of the season. Our results thus show that suboptimal N supply in autumn will not affect lettuce yield, and that nitrate concentration in leaves is lower when NH4 concentrations in nutrient solution are higher and also much lower in red lettuce than in green lettuce.",

The genotypes tested at two locations showed considerable genetic variation for the following agronomic traits that varied for number of leaves (NL) (20.08–179.78), leaf length (LL) (12.36–67.72 cm), leaf width (LW) (4.78–22.02 cm), number of branches (NB) (6.81–13.85), number of pods per plant (NPPP) (14.33–54.04), number of seeds per pod (NSPP) (11.7286.28), pod diameter (PD) (5.75–22.73 mm), plant height (PH) (6.57–233.71 cm), pod length (PL) (3.94–100.92 mm), hundred seed weight (HSWt) (8.11–49.52 g) and grain yield (GY) (0.10-1.48 t ha−1). Grain yield was significant and positively correlated with all of the traits except leaf length. The principal component analysis (PCA) identified four principal components (PCs) contributing to 73.62% of the total explained variation amongst the tested genotypes. The selected cowpea genotypes for most of agronomic characteristics are useful and candidate genetic resources for the development of breeding population in cowpea breeding and enhanced production and productivity for food and nutrition in the country.",

The total drained land area occupies 47% of the country's land area and 86% of the agricultural land area, of which 87% is tile-drained. Although the introduction of drainage has improved the quality of agricultural land, the benefits of drainage are associated with many changes in the local environment. Therefore, a review is presented of the results from various investigations and research studies conducted in Lithuania which have reported the historical and economic aspects of the development of agricultural drainage as well as its environmental effects on landscape structure, local hydrology and nutrient losses in the soil. Temporal changes in drainage run-off since the 1970s are also discussed. Furthermore, positive bidirectional effects of natural processes in and around open drain ditches on both environment and practice are highlighted which show the possibility of fostering them intentionally.",

    "abstract": "Four tillage trials have been performed on moderately well-drained loam soil in southeast Norway for 30–37 years (mean 34), comparing reduced tillage (8–10 cm in spring) with autumn ploughing (25 cm). In some years, additional stubble harrowing in autumn (10–12 cm) was compared with harrowing only in spring. Weeds were controlled with herbicides. Straw residues were retained after around 1990 and no fungicides were used. Grain yields are reported for the last nine years, and compared with earlier years. Results are presented for a number of soil properties measured in recent years. Autumn harrowing gave no consistent yield benefit over harrowing only in spring. There was little difference between ploughed and unploughed treatments in mean grain yields over the whole trial period, and the variability between years was similar in both tillage systems. Relative grain yields, calculated as yields obtained without ploughing in percentage of those obtained with ploughing, appeared to be normally distributed around 100%. Responses were often positive in dry years, and negative in wet years. Reduced tillage gave higher P and K concentrations near the soil surface and slightly lower concentrations in deeper layers. There was little change in their levels, relative to earlier findings. Changes in bulk density and total porosity were mostly attributable to changes in the stratification of organic matter. Reduced tillage increased porosity at 4–8 cm depth and decreased it slightly at 24–28 cm, but there was no change in the intermediate layer. The moisture-holding capacity of the soil was altered little by reduced tillage, and soil aeration properties were satisfactory at all three depths measured. There was no change in the total amount of organic matter stored within the topsoil, despite marked changes in its distribution. Reduced tillage gave significant increases in aggregate stability and an indication of greater earthworm activity.",

    "abstract": "This paper in a uniform manner examines temporal trends in phosphorus (P) concentrations and losses from small and well-monitored agricultural catchments in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Thirty-four catchments (range 0.1-33 km(2)) in Norway (8), Denmark (5), Sweden (8), Finland (4), Estonia (3), Latvia (3) and Lithuania (3) were selected for the study. The time series ranged from 10 (2002-2011) to 21 years (1989-2009). The monthly P concentration and loss time series were tested for significant monotone trends (p <0.05; two-sided test) using the partial Mann-Kendall test with stream discharge as an explanatory variable. The results show a large variation in concentrations and losses of total phosphorus (TP) among the 34 studied catchments, where the long-term mean annual losses varied from 0.09 to 7.5 kg TP ha(-1). In addition, a large interannual variability in losses within catchments was found with up to a factor of 23 between years within the same catchment. Six catchments showed downward temporal trends in the TP loss time series. One upward trend in TP losses was detected in a catchment in south-west Sweden. Eight downward trends were detected in the TP concentration time series. Overall, our results show (1) a huge variability in mean P losses and concentrations among catchments, (2) a huge temporal variability in losses within catchments and (3) few detectable changes in P losses and concentrations over the study period. The results showcase the need for implementation of mitigation strategies towards reduced P losses from agricultural landscapes in the Nordic/Baltic Sea region in order to improve P water quality and ecology in surface waters.",

The efficacy of Beauveria brongniartii, Beauveria bassiana, Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki, B. thuringiensis var. tenebrionis and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was tested against the white grubs in comparison with untreated control (only water suspension was used). The application of biological control agents was conducted twice (April and August). Our observations show that several biological control agents are capable of controlling the populations of the first and second instar larvae of different scarab grub species. The efficacy of most biological control agents, however, declines when larvae reach the third instar stage. The most promising combination tested in our study is that of entomopathogenic fungi and H. bacteriophora for controlling the first- and second-stage instar larvae. In addition, the summer application proved to be more suitable for control of the first-stage instar larvae than the spring application.",

    "abstract": "It is important to understand the dynamics of crop residue decomposition in soils to predict the release of nutrients from remaining residues. The aim of this study is to investigate and monitor the nutrient release processes of crop residue decomposition in soils. For this, a nylon mesh bag method was used. Four maize straw treatments were investigated over a period of 150 days: (1) maize straw above ground placement (AG), (2) maize straw above ground with decomposer accelerator (AGDA), (3) below ground placement (BG), and (4) maize straw below ground/buried placement (BGDA). The decomposition of maize straw and nutrient release between the different treatments showed statistically significant differences. The effect of BG on maize straw decomposition was higher than AG due to better moisture, soil, and microbial contact conditions underground (incorporation) than above ground. However, the effect of the decomposer accelerator (DA) was not significantly different from the other treatments in this study. This may be due to DA being unsuitable for the local area and climate. The rate of maize straw mass decomposition in all four treatments varied from 38.9% (AGDA) to 66.3% (BG) in 150 days. Below ground placement was better for maize straw decomposition than above ground placement, hence it is advisable to incorporate the maize straw residues into the soil rather than leaving it on the soil surface. The organic C mineralization rate varied between 43.2% and 65.9%. The N release rates ranged between 51.1% and 67.7%, for P 76.0–89.8%, and for K release 76.9–91.7%. The release of potassium was higher than 80%, indicating the necessity of less potassium applied in fertilizer. To sum up, incorporating maize straw residues in the soil increases the C pool and nutrient release compared to surface placement.",

    "abstract": "Ammonium toxicity in hydroponically grown crops can affect tomato development. However, it has been shown that the silicon (Si) attenuates ammonium toxicity in plants depending on the plant species, the stage of development and the ammonium concentration in the nutrient solution. Thus, in order to investigate how Si attenuates stress caused by ammonium in tomato, a study was carried out involving plants cultivated up to 40 days after seed germination using nutrient solutions containing ammonium concentrations (1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mmol L−1), in the absence or presence of Si (1 mmol L−1). The accumulation and efficiency of nitrogen and Si use, as well as the concentrations of chlorophyll, carotenoids, malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide and growth parameters was assessed. At a concentration of 1 mmol L−1 ammonium, Si increases the accumulation of nitrogen and Si, the nitrogen use efficiency, the root area and dry biomass of the shoot. At concentrations of 1 and 2 mmol L−1 ammonium, Si increases the leaf area and root dry biomass, and in higher concentrations, there was no effect of Si after the supply of ammonium. It was observed that the addition of Si mitigates ammonium toxicity by 1 mmol L−1 ammonium, and we can recommend its use in the nutrient solution (Si = 1 mmol L−1) to grow tomato cropsthat employs ammonium concentration of 1 mmol L−1.",

The study includes 132 samples of dried milled whole-plant homogenates of forage maize with variation in maturity, representing two growing seasons, three locations in Sweden and three commercial maize hybrids. The samples were measured by a classical sample cup NIR spectrometer and by a pushbroom hyperspectral-imaging instrument. The spectra and a number of variables (crude protein, CP, neutral detergent fibre, starch, water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and organic matter digestibility), morphological variables (leaves, stems & ears) and crop yield were used to make PLS calibration models. Using PLS modelling allowed the determination of how well maize variables can be predicted from NIR spectra and a comparison of the two types of instruments. Most examined variables could be determined equally well, by both instruments, but the pushbroom technique gave slightly better predictions and had higher analytical capacity. Predictions of CP, starch, WSC and the proportions of ears in the maize gave robust. The findings open new possibilities to further utilise the technology in plant breeding, crop management, modelling and forage evaluation.",

This study investigated the effects of plastic mulching on potato yield and water use efficiency (WUE) on the Loess Plateau of China based on a synthesis of 44 publications (1987–2016) from 17 sites. Our results indicated that relative to no mulching, plastic mulching significantly increased the yield and WUE by 29.2% and 31.7%, respectively. The effects on yield under different mulching methods were ranked as follows: ridge-furrow mulching (RFM) > flat mulching (FM), and the effects on yield with different mulching extents were ranked full-area mulching (FAM) > partial-area mulching (PAM). The effects of plastic mulching on the yield using different colors of film were ranked as white plastic mulching (WPM) > black plastic mulching (BPM) and under different rainfall levels as (precipitation < 400 mm) > (precipitation > 400 mm). The rankings of the effects of plastic mulching on WUE were the same as for potato yield. The yield-evapotranspiration (ET) relationship could be described using a quadratic polynomial, and the yield response curve to ET under plastic mulching fell above the no-mulching curve, indicating that plastic mulching can result in higher yields than no mulching when ET is equal. The yield-ET relationship indicated that potatoes required an ET of 334 and 360 mm to achieve the highest yield under plastic mulching and no mulching, respectively, and potato WUE increased linearly with yield under both plastic mulching and no mulching. This study indicated that RFM, FAM and WPM are better potato management measures and that there is potential to improve the yield and WUE on the Loess Plateau.",

In this work, we propose a review in processing information tools-based embedded systems in PA algorithms with different applications: weed detection, numerical counting, monitoring of plant indexes, and disease detection. This review has been based on more than 100 papers to extract useful information on the different techniques used and the information processing systems. The elaborated study presents the various tools, databases, and systems in order to extract the advantages and disadvantages of system and application.",

    "abstract": "Drought is a major abiotic factor causing rice yield loss in rainfed and drought-prone areas, so screening of the cultivars for drought tolerance is crucial. Our study screens 10 commercial rice cultivars grown in the mid-hills of Nepal and four pipeline genotypes. Our objective is to identify the superior drought-tolerant cultivar and suitable indices for screening. The 14 rice genotypes were evaluated under both drought stress and non-stress conditions in randomized complete block design with three replications. The yield reduction for the cultivars ranged from 12-54% during water-stressed conditions. The drought indices mean productivity, geometric mean productivity and stress tolerance index showed a positive and high correlation with grain yield. Based on drought indices, genotype NR 119 showed the highest mean productivity, geometric mean productivity, stress tolerance index and lowest yield loss. Further, principal component analysis bolsters our results by clustering similar drought indices and drought-tolerant cultivars. The NR 119 is followed by Chaite 5 and Chaite 4 as a drought-tolerant genotype, therefore, we recommend it for drought-prone areas of the mid-hill region of Nepal. We identified mean productivity, stress tolerance index and geometric mean productivity as important drought indices, so we recommend using this for drought screening.",

The content of topsoil (0-20 cm) mineral nitrogen was determined during the growth of the grain crop, after grain harvest and after ploughing. In addition, mineralization of nitrogen and carbon was measured in green-manured soil incubated at 15°C and controlled moisture conditions. During grain crop growth, ryegrass tended to reduce soil mineral N compared with the other treatments. After grain harvest, in a small-plot experiment where extra nitrate was added, ryegrass reduced soil nitrate N (0-18 cm) from 4.2 to 0.4 g m−2 within 13 days, while the clovers had negligible effect compared with bare soil. Up to 9.4 g N m−2 was present in above-plus below-ground ryegrass biomass at ploughing. In incubated ryegrass soil, there was a temporary net N immobilization of up to 0.9 g N m−2 as compared with unamended soil. In clover-amended soil, mineral N exceeded that in unamended soil by up to 5 g N m−2.",

The experiments were carried out in 1993, 1994 and 1995, on two soil types, with three levels of fertilizing and without use of pesticides. Fertilizer placement reduced weed biomass by 55% and weed density by 10% and increased grain yield by 28%, on average. The strong effects on weeds were presumably due to a positive interaction between crop competition and weed control by weed harrowing. The biomass of almost all frequent weed species was reduced by fertilizer placement. The effect of fertilizer placement on weed density was weaker than on biomass. Fertilizer placement increased grain yield more on coarse sand than on sandy loam. All the effects were more pronounced in 1993 than in 1994 and 1995, most likely owing to dry weather in the spring of 1993.",

We have determined the ergosterol levels in Swedish grain of different origins: cleaned food-grade wheat from a commercial mill, feed-grade cereals (oats and barley) with different odours and cereals (winter wheat, \"American wheat\", triticale and rye) from various field trials conducted in south-central Sweden in 1990. Specific objectives were to elucidate the relationships between ergosterol levels and numbers of mould colony forming units (CFU) and between ergosterol and grain odour. Ergosterol levels in the food-grade wheat ranged between 2.4 and 2.8 μg/g DW, and between 3.0 and 5.6 μg/g DW in the field trial cereals, while values in most of the feed grain samples ranged from 8–15 μg/g DW. The levels agree with other published data for European grains. A positive correlation was found between numbers of colony-forming units and ergosterol concentration. The degree of correlation was higher when numbers of CFU were determined on dichloran-glycerol 18% agar with a low water activity (aw = 0.95) than on malt extract agar (aw = 0.99). There was no agreement between ergosterol levels and grain odour, since even samples described as having a fresh smell had high ergosterol levels. However, the highest level (33 μg/g DW) was found in a sample with a pronounced musty odour, and the lowest (1.1 μg/g DW) in a sample that smelled as if it had been heat damaged.",

Slurry manure exhibited a lower effect per kg applied N than urea and meat bone meal. The results indicate that no consistent differences in endogenic mould infection were present between treatments. Meat bone meal can be used as a supplement at growth stage 30–31 to increase the protein content.

The soil profile consisted of a dark-grayish brown coloured Ap-horizon and a slightly stony subsoil containing flint and limestones (ca. 2 vol%). The textural composition of the Örja profile was 37% clay, 35% silt (2–60 μ m) and 28% sand, on average. The bulk density was somewhat higher in the Ap-horizon (1.75 + 0.03 kg dm−3) than in the subsoil (1.62 + 0.02 kg dm−3). Assuming a groundwater table of 1 m, the amount of plant-available water was 210 mm. Amounts of carbon and nitrogen in the Örja soil were 73.8 t ha−1 and 7.4 t N ha−1 in the Ap-horizon, respectively; the subsoil contained 40.4 t C ha−1 and 7.0 t N ha−1. The Örja soils did not fix ammonium nitrogen in the plough layer. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) amounted to 18.6 meq 100 g−1 in the Ap-horizon and increased with depth to around 30 meq 100 g−1 soil. The main clay mineral found was illite, amounting to 51%, followed by smectite minerals (19–23%). Kaolinite amounted to 10% of the clay fraction, but no vermiculite was present. Assuming that Orup soil has a mollic epipedon, it was classified as a coarse-loamy, mixed frigid Aquic Haploboroll according to the Soil Taxonomy and as a Haplic Phaeozem according to the revised FAO legend. The soil profile consisted of a dark-brown coloured Ap-horizon and a massive, structureless subsoil. The profile was slightly stony, containing flint, granite and gneiss stones (about 4 vol%). The soil texture was sandy loam with 10-12% clay throughout the profile. Bulk density increased with depth from 1.61 to 1.83 kg dm−3. The compacted and structureless subsoil can limit root growth, and water uptake through roots may be restricted to the Ap-horizon holding 50 mm of plant-available water, assuming a groundwater table of 1 m. Almost all carbon and nitrogen was present in the Ap-horizon, amounting to 107.5 and 10.1 t ha−1, respectively, whereas only 2.5 t C ha−1 and 0.8 t N ha−1 were found in the subsoil. The Orup soils did not fix ammonium nitrogen in the plough layer. The CEC amounted to 15 meq 100 g−1 in the Ap-horizon and ca. 6 meq 100 g−1 in the subsoil. The clay mineralogy was as follows: The content of illite increased from 17 to 37% within the profile. Smectite minerals varied between 15 and 31%. Kaolinite increased from 5 to 15% with depth, and vermiculite (5%) was only found in the Ap-horizon.",

Progress in selection will depend on the genetic variation and the heritability of the traits. This investigation shows that artificial screening for winter survival traits reveals significant genetic variation in Dactylis glomerata in all three characters tested: resistance to Fusarium nivale, resistance to Typhula ishikariensis and resistance to freezing. The broad sense heritability of resistance to snow mould fungi between 0.4 and 0.5, and for freezing resistance between 0.5 and 0.7, indicates good possibilities for improving the traits by selection for resistance. The genotypic correlation calculated from the analysis of covariance of two half-sib families was found to be approximately 1. Although associated with contradictory data, this finding supports the theory that resistance to different winter stress factors is based on the same genetic trait(s).",

The objective of this study was to evaluate possible effects of three mineral fertilizers and four plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains as biofertilizer on soil properties and seedling growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare) at three different soil bulk densities, and in three harvest periods. The application treatments included the control (without bacteria inoculation and mineral fertilizers), mineral fertilizers (N, NP and P) and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria species (Bacillus licheniformis RC04, Paenibacillus polymyxa RC05, Pseudomonas putida RC06, and Bacillus OSU-142) in sterilized soil. The PGPR, fungi, seedling growth, soil pH, organic matter content, available P and mineral nitrogen were determined in soil compacted artificially to three bulk density levels (1.1, 1.25 and 1.40 Mg m−3) at 15, 30, and 45 days of plant harvest. The results showed that all the inoculated bacteria contributed to the amount of mineral nitrogen. Seed inoculation significantly increased the count of bacteria and fungi. Data suggest that seed inoculation of barley with PGPR strains tested increased root weight by 9–12.2%, and shoot weight by 29.7–43.3% compared with control. The N, NP and P application, however, increased root weight up to 18.2, 25.0 and 7.4% and shoot weight by 31.6, 43.4 and 26.4%, respectively. Our data show that PGPR stimulate barley growth and could be used as an alternative to chemical fertilizer. Soil compaction hampers the beneficial plant growth promoting properties of PGPR and should be avoided.",

The rate of decline of in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) and in vitro cell wall digestibility (IVCWD) increased with increasing temperature for all species. Each degree of increase in temperature decreased the IVTD by an average of 0.22 g kg−1 dry matter (DM) day−1 between 9 and 13°C, and by 0.35 g kg−1 DM day−1 between 13 and 17°C. On average, the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) increased at a rate of 0.78 g kg−1 DM day−1 for each degree increase in temperature between 9 and 17°C. The effects of temperature were less for perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue than for the other species. Perennial ryegrass was consistently ranked as highest in digestibility, followed by meadow fescue; tufted hair-grass had the lowest digestibility. The rate of decline in digestibility was slower for perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue than for the other species.",

The study focuses on the impact of land-use types on soil quality by measuring the differences in chemical and physical properties at three sites in adjacently located natural forest land (forest), fallow grassland (grass) and arable land (arable). Soil samples from 0-15 and 15-30 cm depth were collected and examined for particle distribution, dry bulk density, organic matter (OM), pH, macro- and micro-nutrients. Land-use types had a significant effect on primary soil particle distribution. Highest clay content was found in forest and highest sand content in arable. Forest had relatively the highest levels of OM, macro- and micro-nutrients and arable the lowest. Most of the properties of the 0-15 cm surface level of grass were similar to those observed in the 15-30 cm level in forest. Arable exhibited lowest nutrient status and poorest physical conditions, indicating a degrading effect of arable cultivation practices on soil. Grass and arable showed, compared to forest, a 30–60% average increase in bulk density and 26–66% average decrease in OM. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation of OM with available phosphorus and potassium while it had negative correlation with dry bulk density and pH. Natural vegetation appeared to be a main contributor of soil quality as it maintained the organic carbon stock, and increased the nutrient status of soil and is therefore important for sustainable development of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and other similar areas. Furthermore, OM was shown to be an important indicator of soil quality.",

Soil properties at 0–15 cm depth were also measured in undisturbed forest, forest with free grazed system, managed forest, and grassland to compare the soil quality index (SQI) of topsoils. The SOC and nutrient concentration decreased with increasing profile depth. The SOC and N contents in the 0–15 cm depth of forest soils were significantly greater than the corresponding depth in upland maize and millet, irrigated rice, and grazed systems. On the other hand, available P and K concentrations at the same depth were significantly greater in upland maize and millet compared to irrigated rice, grazed system, and forest land uses. The SOC and N stocks (0–15 cm) increased from agricultural land at the valley bottom at about 1000 m above mean sea level (a.s.l.) (24 and 3 Mg ha−1) compared to undisturbed forest (74 and 5.9 Mg ha−1) at 2600 m a.s.l, demonstrating the effects of cover and elevation. Both SOC and N stocks decreased sharply in grassland (54 and 4.5 Mg ha−1) at elevations of 2600 to 2800 m a.s.l. compared with undisturbed forest. Above 2800 m a.s.l. the cover type changed from grass to coniferous forest, and the SOC and N stocks steadily increased at the summit level (3200 m a.s.l.) to 65 and 6.9 Mg ha−1, respectively. Slope and aspect significantly affected SOC with the northwest aspect having significantly higher concentrations (46 g kg−1) than other aspects. Similarly, SOC concentration at the lowest slope position (39 g kg−1) was significantly higher than the middle or upper positions (25 and 13 g kg−1). Integrated soil quality index (SQI) values varied from 0.17 to 0.69 for different land uses, being highest for undisturbed forest and lowest for irrigated rice. The SQI demonstrated the degradation status of land uses in the following ascending order: irrigated rice > grazed system > forest with free grazing > upland maize and millet > managed forest > grass land > undisturbed forest. The irrigated rice, grazed system, upland maize and millet, and freely grazed forestlands need immediate attention to minimize further deterioration of soil quality in these land uses.",

The nematode preparations were tested at doses of 200, 1000, and 2000 IJs per adult and at temperatures 15°C, 20°C, and 25°C. The numbers of beetles killed were recorded two, four, six, and eight days after treatment. The nematodes were more effective at 20°C and 25°C than at 15°C. At 20°C, the nematodes had killed between 44% (H. megidis at the lowest dose tested) and 77% (S. feltiae at the lowest dose tested) of the beetles eight days after treatment. At the two highest doses tested, the S. feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and H. bacteriophora preparations each killed at least 74% of the beetles at 25°C. Steinernema feltiae was the most effective nematode (LC50=483–1467 IJs/adult) and, as an alternative to chemical insecticides, appears to have the highest potential for controlling overwintered flea beetles (May) under field conditions. The nematodes S. feltiae, S. carpocapsae and H. bacteriophora would all be suitable for controlling adult flea beetles during warm summer months, when flea beetles occur in high numbers in Slovenia.",

The superiority of HOA for AY genotypes was due to efficient translocation of photosynthates to the roots, as indicated by the significant relationship of all root traits with OA and better mobilization of reserves to the developing head by the OA as suggested by a very strong relationship of OA with HI. Among different yield components, OA showed the highest relationship with the number of achenes per head, suggesting that reserves mobilized by OA were utilized to produce a large number of achenes per head. Genotype AMES-10103 belonging to the HOA group showed its superiority over other genotypes under drought stress.

In order to estimate when previously unmineralised N is plant-available in relation to fertilisation time-point, net N mineralisation was studied in incubations under natural temperature conditions. The fertilisers studied were meat and bone meal (Biofer), dairy slurry, dairy manure, chicken manure, and a by-product from yeast production (Vinasse). The fertilisers were mixed with soil and incubated in plastic bottles placed in topsoil in south-west Sweden on different dates throughout the year, simulating fertiliser application in autumn, early spring, spring, and early summer. Bottles were sampled for analysis of NH4-N and NO3-N on three to seven occasions until late autumn and the experiment was repeated in two consecutive years. Dairy slurry and dairy manure had a very slow, almost negligible, net N mineralisation after application. Slurry with rather high ammonium content should therefore be applied as close to crop demand as other circumstances allow, whereas dairy farmyard manure with very low mineral N content can be applied off-season. Chicken manure had a considerable proportion of mineral N initially, but released further mineral N after application. Vinasse and Biofer had almost no mineral N initially, but much of the N present mineralised rapidly. About 65% of total N in Biofer, Vinasse, and chicken manure was in mineral form within 30–50 days or 450 growing degree-days (GDD), after which net mineralisation ceased. This indicates that these three types of fertiliser should be applied at least one month before the end of crop N uptake and that autumn application is associated with a risk of N leaching unless a crop with high N uptake is present during winter.",

A field study was conducted (i) to examine the diurnal and seasonal soil CO2 flux pattern in spring maize fields on the Loess Plateau, and (ii) to determine the effects of soil characteristics affected by various cultivation practices on CO2 flux from the soil surface to the atmosphere. Soil surface CO2 flux was determined with an LI-8100 Automated Soil Flux System, and related environmental factors were also measured, including near-ground air temperature and relative humidity, soil moisture (0–15 cm), soil temperature (at depths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm), and leaf area index. Diurnal soil CO2 flux showed a single peak between 12-00 h and 16-00 h, and reached a minimum in the early morning, at about 4-00 h. During the crop's growing season, soil CO2 flux increased during the rapid vegetative growth stages, reached its maximum during the peak reproductive stages, and then declined as the plants senesced. Time series analysis showed that the temporal dynamics of the CO2 flux were more closely related to air temperature than to soil temperature; this may be because a substantial portion of the CO2 originated from surface residues. The time-averaged mean soil CO2 flux for different cultivation practices over the growing season was ranked as follows: plastic film mulching (3.980 µmol m−2s−1) > corn straw mulching (3.464 µmol m−2s−1) > supplementary irrigating (3.157 µmol m−2s−1) > rain-fed (2.371 µmol m−2s−1) > bare ground (1.934 µmol m−2s−1). Different cultivation practices affected plant and microbial activities, and soil hydrothermal conditions, and caused different patterns of soil surface CO2 flux in spring maize fields on the Loess Plateau.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The natural harvesting and cultivation of Tuber melanosporum (black truffle of Périgord) has spread throughout many countries in recent decades. Other black truffles such as T. aestivum, T. brumale, and T. mesentericum cause damage to T. melanosporum exploitation. These truffle species have been found to be very much present in the mycorrhizal contamination of natural T. melanosporum burns. Nevertheless, different studies have been unable to determine whether the aggressiveness of T. melanosporum and its resistance to this contamination pressure are qualities of the environment or of the soil. Moreover, the biological and physical-chemical conditions causing T. melanosporum burns have yet to be clarified. The aim of this study is therefore to establish the relationship between the carpophore presence of Tuber species (T. melanosporum as compared with T. aestivum and T. mesentericum) and the concentration of soil variables. Principal component analysis (PCA) and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) show that active carbonate content is the variable that accounts for the greatest percentage of occupancy in the T. melanosporum habitat. A high concentration of active carbonate accounts for up 43% of T. melanosporum carpophore production and 51% of the variance in the size of T. melanosporum burns. We propose that active carbonate is a major factor in the fruiting and aggressiveness of T. melanosporum versus T. aestivum and T. mesentericum. Moreover, the development of the T. melanosporum burn increases the formation of active carbonate, suggesting a feedback process. The results obtained could have applications in natural harvesting and truffle culture.",

Trees were planted in spring 1999; the plant material was one-year-old whips, spaced 2.0×4.5 m and formed with a central leader as free spindles. Tree vigour, yield, fruit size, fruit quality, and yield efficiency were evaluated for the seven subsequent years. Tree size was significantly affected by the rootstocks after seven years' growth. Wangenheim produced the smallest and St. Julien A and Pixy the largest trees as measured by trunk cross-sectional area, on average for the different cultivars. However, Pixy produced significant larger yields per tree for the cultivar 'Reeves' than did St. Julien A. 'Edda' gave the smallest yield and 'Avalon the largest. Trees on Pixy were the most yield efficient for all cultivars with the exception of 'Victoria'. The fruit sizes became little affected by the different rootstocks. 'Edda' and 'Victoria' produced the smallest fruits and 'Excalibur' and 'Reeves' the largest. Fruit quality characterized by the content of soluble solids was on average 16.1% and did not differ between trees on the various rootstocks. The cultivar 'Avalon' had the highest contents of soluble solids and 'Reeves' the lowest. The nutrient levels in the leaves were within the optimum range by the end of the seventh season. Trees on Marianna GF 8-1 had the highest nitrogen and magnesium leaf uptake. In conclusion, St. Julien A and Pixy were the most reliable semi-vigorous rootstocks which induced high yield efficiency and with favourable influences on fruit quality to the six European plum cultivars. Pixy is a good alternative to St. Julien A, with a lower vigour in trees, more precocity, and higher yield efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant-available P was first extracted in soils 114 years ago and a number of different analytical methods have since been developed, but for good reasons none of these methods has been adopted as a standard for all soils. With increasing cooperation within research, there is a need to harmonise the interpretation of analytical data for fertiliser recommendations, research, and environmental control. This paper evaluates the compatibility of the Swedish standard ammonium lactate (PAL) method and the widely used Olson's sodium bicarbonate (POls) method in 82 topsoil samples taken from Swedish long-term soil fertility field trials. The PAL-values were usually larger than POls, with a mean PAL/POls quotient of 2.30±1.04 (0.67–6.58). The PAL and POls means and ranges were 126±89 (5–360) and 55.1±33 (3.1–122.8) mg P kg−1 dry soil, respectively. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between PAL and POls and how this relationship was affected by clay content, pH, and soil organic carbon content (SOC). After statistical transformation, it emerged that the square root of clay content (17.4%±13.82, range 1–54.4) and pH (6.45±0.54, range 5.5–7.7) significantly affected the relationship at partial R 2-values of 2 and 12%, respectively, while ln(SOC) (2.54%±1.21, range 1–6.03) did not, apparently due the narrow range. The regressions of predicted vs. measured values explained 95 and 94% of the variation in PAL and POls, respectively. The mean deviation of predicted compared with measured values was 21.3 and 8.3 mg P kg−1 dry soil for PAL and POls, respectively, corresponding to 20 or 19% of the measured values. We conclude that a data set consisting of PAL-values can be converted into POls-values and vice versa with reasonably high accuracy when accounting for clay content and pH.",

Soils of abandoned areas are generally of low quality and thereby limited suitability for crop production; as a result soil–crop suitability analyses could form the basis of knowledge-based bio-energy planning. The study estimated suitable areas for bio-energy production using willow (Salix sp), grey alder [Alnus incana (L.) Moench], hybrid aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.×Populus tremula L.), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), and Caucasian goat's rue (Galega orientalis Lam.) in separate plantations. A combined land-use strategy is also presented as these crops are partially suitable to the same areas. Reed canary grass and grey alder have the highest energy potentials and each would re-use more than 80% of the available abandoned agricultural land. Energy grasses and short-rotation forestry in combined land-use strategy represents the opportunity of covering approximately a quarter of county's annual energy demand. The study estimates only agronomic potential, so further bio-energy analysis should take into account technical and economic limitations. Developed framework supports knowledge-based decision-making processes from field to regional scale to achieve sustainable bio-energy production.",

Litter production and the decomposition rate were studied on commonly planted broad-leaved Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus saligna) and coniferous (Juniperus procera, Cupressus lusitanica, Pinus patula) plantation species and compared with the adjacent broad-leaved natural forest. The production of litter was recorded by litter traps and the decomposition rate was studied by nylon net bag technique. Litter production under broad-leaved plantation species and natural forest (that varied from 9.7 to 12.6 Mg ha−1 y−1) was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that under coniferous species (that varied from 4.9 to 6.6 Mg ha−1 y−1). The average concentration of C and N in fresh mature leaves was higher than in leaf-litter fall, implying that both C and N were either sorbed in the plant system or lost through decomposition, leaching or erosion during the leaf-litter fall period. The amount of N, which potentially returned to the soil through the leaf-litter fall, tended to be higher in natural forest than in Eucalyptus plantations. The residual litter mass in the litter bag declined with time for all species. The annual dry matter decay constant (k) varied from 0.07 m−1 in Pinus patula to 0.12 m−1 in Eucalyptus saligna. The half-time (t0.5) decay varied from 6.0 for Eucalyptus saligna to 9.7 months for Pinus patula. The results suggest that the decomposition rate in Pinus patula was relatively lower than the other species and the litter production under broad-leaved Eucalyptus was comparatively higher than that in coniferous species. Overall the litter decomposition was fast for all species. The higher litter production and its relative faster rate of decomposition is a positive aspect to be considered during species selection for the restoration of degraded habitats given other judicious management practices such as prolonging the rotation period are adhered to.",

Four recombinant inbred lines (L34, L83, L115 and L147) and one variety cultivated in Morocco (Concesa) were inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 in hydroaeroponic culture. Two P levels i.e. 75 (deficient level) and 250 µmol plant−1 week−1 P (sufficient level) were applied and the trial was assessed 42 days after transplanting that coincide with plant flowering stage. Under P-deficiency, decrease of plant growth (18%) and nodule biomass (19%) was detected and significantly pronounced in the sensitive line L147 compared with the remaining genotypes. Additionally, under P-deficiency, the efficiency in use of rhizobial symbiosis, estimated by the slope of the regression model of shoot biomass as a function of nodule biomass, was significantly increased in the four lines. This constraint did not significantly influence nodule P content in Concesa, but it was 24 and 41% lower in the tolerant and in the sensitive lines, respectively. Nodule P content was positively correlated to nodule biomass, r=0.75, and shoot N, r=0.92. These genotypic variations were associated with variability in nodule O2 permeability that was significantly affected by the P level-bean genotype interaction. Under P-deficiency, nodule O2 permeability was significantly reduced in the tested genotypes and accompanied with a decrease in shoot N content, especially in the sensitive lines (35%). Moreover, the ratios plant N fixed: nodule P content and plant N fixed:nodule dry weight were affected under P-deficiency in four lines with an exception observed in Concesa. Depending on the observed data we concluded that N2 fixation efficiency could be influenced by nodulation and level of nodule P requirement which depend on both bean genotypes and P level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soils contaminated with heavy metals constitute a serious and widespread ecological problem but to clean such soils requires strong chemicals such as polycarboxylates; frequently ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid are used. However, these compounds are synthetic and toxic and their replacement by natural products such as soluble humic substances as washing agents for cleaning heavy metal polluted soils would be environmentally very attractive. In fact, such a replacement seems possible at least on cadmium and copper contaminated soil inasmuch as humic substances, depending on the concentration, were found to extract up to 45% and 54% of total cadmium and copper from a highly contaminated calcareous soil. Even though higher amounts of the two metals were extracted by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, the humic substances undoubtedly extracted the most reactive fractions. However, the humic substances extracted only 4% of total lead and 17% of total nickel, whereas the percentages for the synthetic polycarboxylates were about 30% for nickel and lead. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid may therefore be replaced by humic substances as washing agents for cadmium, copper and maybe nickel contaminated soils, whereas they seem unsuited for cleaning lead contaminated soils, at least if the soils are as calcareous as the soil tested.",

    "abstract": "Erosion and loss of soil is a large problem for water quality all over the world. Mitigation measures need to target the main sources of erosion at the right scale. For many areas there is still great uncertainty at the catchment level as to what are the main sources of erosion and how they can be managed. The objective of this article was to investigate the effect of tillage on soil losses at the field and catchment scale. Long-term monitoring data (20 years) from a catchment and a nested field site in the south eastern Norway were used. Results from the Vandsemb field showed that soil losses were on average 940 kg ha−1 yr−1 for years (n=5) when the field was autumn ploughed and 174 kg ha−1 yr−1 for years (n=8) when the field was not tilled in autumn. For the total monitoring period, surface soil losses were 330 kg ha−1 yr−1, whereas sub-surface soil losses were 130 kg ha−1 yr−1. Total phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) losses in surface runoff were 460 g ha−1 yr−1 and 150 g ha−1 yr−1, respectively and in sub-surface runoff they were 530 g ha−1 yr−1 and 270 g ha−1 yr−1, respectively. At the catchment scale, no relationship was found between the soil tillage on agricultural fields and the variation in losses of suspended sediments (SS) at the catchment scale. The average losses at Mørdre were for suspended sediments 2140 kg ha−1yr−1, for total phosphorus 2320 g ha−1 yr−1, and for DRP 240 g ha−1 yr−1. Weather conditions, especially during winter, were important for the temporal variation in losses of SS at both sites. Soil losses from the Mørdre catchment were approximately five times higher than from the Vandsemb field. The study findings suggest that changes in soil tillage were not the dominating cause of variations in loss of SS from the catchment, although these changes were important at the field scale.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intercropping of legumes with non-legumes is an ancient crop production method used to improve quality and dry matter (DM) yields of forage and grain, and to control weeds. However, there is little information regarding intercropping at high latitudes. The objectives of this field study were to evaluate performance of (1) sole cropped oat (Avena sativa L.) (cultivars Toral and Calibre) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) (cultivars Carneval and Orb) and their intercrop combinations, and (2) inter- and sole-crop responses to weeds. The different cropping systems were studied with different weed treatments (weed-free all season long, weed-free until flowering, and left weedy all season long). In general intercrops of oat and pea produced DM (forage) and grain yields similar to sole oat crops and higher than sole pea crops although the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, forage quality [crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF)] was improved by intercropping. Most of the variables measured were unaffected by weed treatments, however weed DM was generally lower in sole oat and oat-pea intercropping than sole pea cropping systems. More than 80% of the weed DM was from common lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album L.). The CP of this weed was higher than oat and pea, and ADF and NDF were equivalent to the sole cropped oat. Thus, including weeds as part of the forage is possible. However, if crops are grown for grain, weeds are likely to produce large numbers of seeds that would enter the seed bank. Thus, pea–oat intercrops show potential as an alternative and sustainable approach for optimum yield and high quality forage and weed control under Alaskan subarctic conditions.",

Compared with soil samples from areas exposed to low intensity combat activity soil samples from areas exposed to heavy fighting had higher concentrations of As, Hg and Pb than allowed by national legislation for ecologic farming as well as even higher concentrations of Hg than the maximum allowed values for agriculture in general. Descriptive statistics shows that mean values of Cu, Zn, Ni, Pb, P and Ba are all higher in samples collected at the areas of high combat activity compared with the ones collected from the low combat activity areas. Sb concentration was elevated in one location, which can also be correlated with population exposure. The results of the principal component analysis suggest possible correlation between the war activity and the degree of contamination by the metals found in ammunition.",

The experiment was carried out in temperature-controlled and non-temperature-controlled (NTC) tunnels. Fertigation was applied at three levels (100%, 75%, and 50%) of the recommended nutrient concentration. Mycoroot™, containing four arbuscular mycorrhizal species (Glomus etunicatum, Paraglomus occultum, Glomus clarum, and Glomus mosseae), was applied at seeding, as well as transplanting. Growing tomatoes under reduced nutrient supply reduced the total soluble solids in the juice of the fruits, but improved total and marketable yield, as well as the number of marketable fruits. This effect was more substantial in the temperature-controlled tunnel than in the NTC tunnel. Fruit firmness and leaf chlorophyll concentrations were significantly higher in plants grown in the temperature-controlled tunnel. Growing tomatoes in sawdust improved the leaf Mn and Ca concentration over that of tomato plants grown in coir. Mycorrhiza colonization did not have a beneficial effect on tomato yield and quality. Further studies, including different media, nutrient composition, and concentration need to be carried out to investigate the possible effect of AMF failing to improve yield, despite AMF root colonization, and to reveal the cause of the poor beneficial effect of AMF on tomato plants grown under soilless culture.",

However, the observed pattern of changes is variable, not only between grass species but also between different experiments. This study examined the effect of developmental stage on carbohydrate reserves during winter in two grass species differing in winter hardiness. Timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), sown early or late in the growing season, were sampled for total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) in late October (end of main growing season), and then in late January, early March and late April. Quantitative and qualitative patterns of carbohydrate accumulation in crown segments were influenced both by plant genotype and developmental stage of the plants prior to winter. TNC increased from October to March, demonstrating considerable cell activity during winter, and declined to their lowest level in April. Sucrose proved to be the major reserve carbohydrate, followed by fructans. The highest content of TNC was found in the most winter-hardy cultivars, particularly in January and March. Early-sown plants accumulated higher levels of fructans than of sucrose, whereas late-sown plants mainly accumulated sucrose. These differences persisted during the winter. It can be concluded that the pattern of carbohydrate accumulation during winter differed between the two species studied and it was strongly affected by both cultivar and plant-developmental stage.",

Since less flower trusses could lead to reduced yield, this study was conducted to investigate whether increased plant density could contribute to increase yield per unit area. The response of nine tomato cultivars with early decapitation of growing points at different plant densities (10, 16, 20 and 25 plants/m2) was investigated in a closed hydroponic system under a 40% white shadenet structure. The growing points of all plants were removed between the second and third inflorescence, with two leaves remaining above the second inflorescence. Fruit physiological disorders, number of fruits, as well as total and marketable yield were recorded. Cultivar 'Miramar', gave the highest marketable and total yield, followed by cultivars 'Rodade' and 'Alfar'. Cultivars 'Alexis', 'Star9006' and 'Zeal' produced highest average fruit mass compared to other cultivars. There was no significant interaction effect between cultivars and plant densities on tomato yield. Fruit cracking was significantly higher for 'Linares' and 'Star9006', while raincheck was higher for cultivars 'Alexis' and 'FA593'. 'Rodade' showed high incidence of zippering. Plant densities of 20 or 25 plants/m2 produced significantly higher marketable and total yield, while plant densities of 10 or 16 plants/m2 resulted in higher average fruit mass and highest incidence of fruit cracking. Nutrient uptake, as revealed in the mineral content of fruit, was not affected by plant density. Cultivar 'Rodade', an open-pollinated determinate cultivar, especially shows potential to compete with more expensive hybrid cultivars in such a production system in terms of yield.

Soils under three biofuel crops, corn (Zea mays), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and willow (Salix spp.), were analyzed seven years after establishment to assess the effects on soil bulk density (ρb), penetration resistance (PR), water-holding capacity, and infiltration characteristics. The PR was the highest under corn, along with the lowest associated water content, while PR was 50–60% lower under switchgrass. In accordance with PR data, surface (0–10 cm) bulk density also tended to be lower under switchgrass. Both water infiltration rates and cumulative infiltration amounts varied widely among and within the three crops. Because the Philip model did not fit the data, results were analyzed using the Kostiakov model instead. Switchgrass plots had an average cumulative infiltration of 69 cm over 3 hours with a constant infiltration rate of 0.28 cm min−1, compared with 37 cm and 0.11 cm min−1 for corn, and 26 cm and 0.06 cm min−1 for willow, respectively. Results suggest that significant changes in soil physical and hydrologic properties may require more time to develop. Soils under switchgrass may have lower surface bulk density, higher field water capacity, and a more rapid water infiltration rate than those under corn or willow.",

Furthermore, application of composted organic waste could be a way to sustain both soil fertility and production, especially in organic farming. Therefore, the aim of this research was to evaluate the phytotoxicity and the effects of application of olive pomace composts on emmer performance and soil properties. Two types of olive pomace composts, with a different initial C/N ratio, were stopped at the active phase and processed until maturation. The obtained four olive pomace composts were compared with a commercial fertilizer in a two-year field experiment. Before the field trial, a bioassay was performed to assess phytotoxicity both for the raw pomace and the not-stabilized composts. Growing and yielding data for emmer were determined during the two-year period and soil characteristics were measured at the start and at the end of the experiment. The composts were not phytotoxic (germination index was higher than 90%) and their total organic carbon content was always higher than the minimum values established by the Italian fertilizers legislation. The emmer protein content was significantly higher in the matured compost treatment with low C/N, than in the other compost treatments. Its value was comparable with that of the commercial fertilizer, suggesting a good performance on crop yield quality. Although not significant, this compost showed an increase of 9.8% in grain yield compared with commercial fertilizer treatment. On the whole, it can be suggested that repeated compost application might preserve the soil organic carbon content and supply macronutrients to a crop.",

A significant influence of the Brassica species on the feeding by the flea beetles was confirmed at both locations.

The initial damage by the cabbage flea beetles occurred in the first half of May, whereas the greatest damage occurred at the beginning of July. The research shows that the onset of cabbage flea beetle feeding can be controlled in a medium-late cabbage cultivar using trap cropping.

Five amendment materials (sphagnum peat, compost, zeolite, TerraCottem and Stockosorb) were mixed with a medium-coarse sand at various rates. The upper rootzone layer (0–150 mm) included 50%, 100% and 150% of published or manufacturersã recommended rates of each amendment material. Three amendment rates were included in the lower rootzone layer (150–300 mm): pure sand, half the amendment rate of the top layer, and the same amendment rate as the top layer. The following measurements were made: water retention in individual layers, volumetric water content in the top layer (0–60 mm), shear strength, surface hardness, permanent wilting point. Water retention was significantly influenced by the different amendment materials. The most water retentive mixes were those containing peat and Stockosorb, whilst the least retentive contained the TerraCottem and the pure sand. The influence of amendment rate in the lower layer was less in comparison with the top layer. The incorporation of amendment materials in the lower rootzone had no significant effect on water retention in the upper rootzone but did increase the total water storage in the profile and this would have some implications for plant growth during drier periods. Rootzone mixes containing peat and compost had the highest shear strength whilst the Stockosorb gave the lowest strength because the expansion of the polymer reduced rootzone density and therefore the degree of contact between the sand particles. The hardest surface was measured when zeolite was used and the softest surfaces resulted from the use of Stockosorb.",

In an attempt to uniform the duration of phasic development across sowing dates, the length of phases and sub-phases was calculated in days and in thermal time using nine combinations of cardinal temperatures. A sequence of stages and various patterns of coordinated development were maintained throughout all sowings and years. Specifically, (1) the first inflorescence became visible after three true leaves had fully expanded on the main stem; (2) flowering reached the terminal inflorescence cluster before full-sized green fruits became visible in the first inflorescence, and (3) fruit ripening in the whole plant ended within two weeks of the end of ripening in the oldest inflorescence. Plant size was increased with the delay of sowing, and the length of the growth cycle was by approximately 400°Cd longer when plants experienced a day length longer than 15 h. This changed the correspondence between flowering and ripening stages, so that full flowering was associated with the development of green fruits in the first inflorescence when the cycle was short, but with their development in the terminal cluster when it was long. Trends in grain yield did not correspond to those in plant size and phase length. We are confident that this growth scale will be a valuable tool for following the progress of buckwheat development and to predict growth patterns and harvest time in response to temperature and photoperiod.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Roadside vegetation is subject to significant salt stress as a result of runoff water and road de-icing practices in cold weather climates. Salt-tolerant turfgrass can play a role in maintaining roadsides that are both functional and sustainable. As such, the objective of this research was to evaluate the differential salt tolerance of turfgrass cultivars that may be suitable for roadside establishment. Three replications of 75 cool-season turfgrass cultivars were established in a randomized complete block design at two locations: Roselawn Cemetery (Roseville, MN, USA) and MnROAD research facility (Albertville, MN, USA). Plots were seeded during August and September of 2010. Visual ratings of establishment were collected throughout the fall, and survival was evaluated visually in spring 2011. Numerous cultivars of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) established best at all locations in the fall; however, winter survival varied by location. Cultivars of alkaligrass (Puccinellia spp.), including ‘Fults,’ ‘Salty,’ ‘Oceania,’ and ‘Salton Sea,’ performed best at Albertville. ‘Shoreline’ slender creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. ssp. litoralis), ‘Navigator’ strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. ssp. rubra), and an advanced population of sheep fescue (Festuca ovina L.) from the University of Minnesota turfgrass breeding program were among the most salt tolerant at Roseville. Site-dependent performance and effective salt tolerance of cultivars from numerous species indicate that a carefully chosen mix will be best for establishment and maintenance of high-quality roadsides.",

    "abstract": "High temperature has deleterious impacts on tomato growth and development and limits its production. Acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) and 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) have been widely reported as stress-ameliorating agents. The effect of exogenous application of varying levels of EBL (0.75, 1.5, and 3 µM) and ASA (0.25, 0.75, and 1.25 mM) on root activity (RA) in terms of 2,3,5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) reduction and root morphological features was evaluated in four-week-old tomato seedlings (cultivar: Mei Jie Lo) grown under high-temperature stress (46°C/4 h per day) for 21 days. The daily heat stress treatment almost ceased the root growth of chemically untreated seedlings. However, both EBL and ASA significantly attenuated the deleterious impacts of heat stress to different extents regarding root activity, total root length, surface area, volume, and number of nodes and connections. Different concentrations demonstrated signature effects. EBL (3 µM) was over all the best treatment to improve root activity whereas ASA (0.25 mM) best enhanced root architecture (net length, volume, and area) as compared to the untreated heat-stressed controls. However, EBL (3 µM) and ASA (1.25 mM) slightly inhibited mean root diameter. It is concluded that under high-temperature conditions, the exogenous EBL and ASA in studied doses improve root morphological features and root activity, hence enhance heat stress tolerance. Both chemical agents can be potential candidates in practical agriculture for extension of tomato growth period in summer by virtue of their heat stress amelioration ability.",

Nine of the varieties grown were susceptible and two varieties very susceptible to late blight. The most resistant variety was Toluca (foliar blight estimated mean value 5.9), which is immune to foliar blight in its land of origin.

    "abstract": "Rapid and uniform crop establishment is a prerequisite for efficient crop production and minimal environmental impact. Extensive experiments were carried out in shallow plastic boxes placed in the field directly on the ground for studies of the effects of seedbed properties on emergence of small-grain cereal crops in a cool, temperate climate. This paper presents studies of the seedbed as a protective layer against evaporation and the requirements for good emergence under dry weather conditions. Without rainfall after sowing, nearly complete emergence of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was obtained, when rapidly germinating seed was placed on a moderately compacted basal layer containing at least 5% (w/w) plant-available water and covered by a 4 cm deep surface layer consisting of aggregates < 5 mm. This applied even when initial water content in the surface layer was below the wilting point and potential evaporation was high. If the soil at 4 cm depth is drier or if a sufficiently fine seedbed cannot be obtained, then seedbed and sowing depth should be somewhat greater, and if the soil is wetter, then the depth may be smaller. There were only small differences in emergence between surface layers consisting of aggregates < 2 mm, 2–4 mm or 2–5 mm, or dominated by these aggregate fractions, but when the surface layer consisted of coarser aggregates, emergence was usually much lower. Determinations of water losses from the soil during the experimental period showed that the differences in emergence were caused by differences in efficiency of the seedbed to control evaporation. The results indicate that, in an initially wet soil, it is always possible to find a time and method for seedbed preparation and sowing that lead to good emergence of small-grain cereal crops, even with a lengthy period without rainfall after sowing.",

The basic aims of plant breeding are 'high yield, high quality and quantity, extension of adaptation ability to climate and soil conditions and tolerance or resistance to pests and diseases'. Plant breeders use the genetic variations between plants to attain these objectives. Successful adaptation to environmental conditions and success in plant breeding are bounded by the range of the genetic base, as measured by genetic diversity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Pea root rot disease caused by the pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches deserves increased attention, since peas are an important cash crop and also improve the N balance in temperate agriculture. However, due to pea root rot it is difficult to cultivate peas as frequently and successfully as desired. In the search for biological measures to overcome this problem, attention has been drawn to the use of Brassicaceae plants as cover crops between main crops, since these can be effective catch crops for nutrients and also exert allelopathic effects. Many species within the Brassicaceae contain glucosinolates (GSLs). Their hydrolysis products, the volatile isothiocyanates (ITCs), have been shown to suppress soil-borne plant pathogens such as A. euteiches. In addition, Brassicaceae biomass releases water-soluble toxic substances such as oxazolidine-2-thione and supplies nutrients and organic matter. Overall, this influences the soil microbial community and the final suppression of pathogens. Due to the unpredictability of the control effect of Brassicaceae biomass incorporation into soil on the pathogen, there is a need to define the mechanisms behind suppression in the field situation. This review focuses on how incorporation of Brassicaceae biomass suppresses A. euteiches under field conditions and the effect on the emerging pea. Different factors influencing the severity of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) root rot disease are also discussed. One conclusion is that suppression of pea root rot depends on the quality and quantity of incorporated Brassicaceae biomass.",

Hordeum maritimum plants were cultivated in pots filled with a clay-loam soil containing 0 or 40 t ha−1 of compost and irrigated with tap water at 0 or 4 g l−1 NaCl. Soil properties and heavy metal (Zn2 +, Pb2 +, Cd2 +) accumulation were investigated. Municipal solid waste compost application significantly increased the soil contents of carbon, nitrogen and potassium under both non-saline and saline conditions. Soil heavy metal concentrations increased substantially too, but the recorded values were below the toxicity limits. Interestingly, plants subjected to the salt–compost interaction were more vigorous, compared with those grown on non-amended soil. Altogether, our data indicate that short-term utilization of municipal solid waste compost at 40 t ha−1 may be of potential interest in the perspective of the rehabilitation of salt-affected soils. Yet, it must be stressed that the present findings are preliminary and need to be further evaluated under field conditions before practical recommendations can be inferred.",

    "abstract": "Biofuels from bioenergy crops may substitute a significant part of fossil fuels in the transport sector where, e.g., the European Union has set a target of using 10% renewable energy by 2020. Savings of greenhouse gas emissions by biofuels vary according to cropping systems and are influenced by such regional factors as soil conditions, climate and input of agrochemicals. Here we analysed at a regional scale the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with cultivation of winter wheat for bioethanol and winter rapeseed for rapeseed methyl ester (RME) under Danish conditions. Emitted CO2 equivalents (CO2eq) were quantified from the footprints of CO2, CH4 and N2O associated with cultivation and the emissions were allocated between biofuel energy and co-products. Greenhouse gas emission at the national level (Denmark) was estimated to 22.1 g CO2eq MJ−1 ethanol for winter wheat and 26.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 RME for winter rapeseed. Results at the regional level (level 2 according to the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics [NUTS]) ranged from 20.0 to 23.9 g CO2eq MJ−1 ethanol and from 23.5 to 27.6 g CO2eq MJ−1 RME. Thus, at the regional level emission results varied by up to 20%. Differences in area-based emissions were only 4% reflecting the importance of regional variation in yields for the emission result. Fertilizer nitrogen production and direct emissions of soil N2O were major contributors to the final emission result and sensitivity analyses showed that the emission result depended to a large extent on the uncertainty ranges assumed for soil N2O emissions. Improvement of greenhouse gas balances could be pursued, e.g., by growing dedicated varieties for energy purposes. However, in a wider perspective, land-use change of native ecosystems to bioenergy cropping systems could compromise the CO2 savings of bioenergy production and challenge the targets set for biofuel production.",

Field trials were conducted at the Institute of Agriculture at the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry during the period 2012–2013. The perennial forage legumes were grown without mineral or organic fertilizers. The maize was grown (a) without and (b) with nitrogen fertilizers. The perennial forage legumes were harvested three times per growing season. Carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) contents of biomass were determined by using a dry combustion method. The calorific value of biomass was determined by a combustion method using an IKA bomb calorimeter. The largest share of the total annual yield of biomass of perennial forage legumes was obtained from the first cut and amounted to 54% and 57% for alfalfa and fodder galega, respectively. The S content of biomass was similar in all crops investigated, but the N content was higher in perennial forage legumes. Biomass C content did not differ between the crops, but the C:N ratio was widely varied – from 28–35 in fertilized maize, to 16–17 in alfalfa and 15–16 in fodder galega. This study showed that alfalfa and fodder galega can be grown as energy crops under less intensive management; however, the specific chemical composition of biomass should be considered before choosing the most appropriate conversion process.",

Following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, 15 isolates belonging to biovar 3 were identified, one of which was named XWY0007 and used as the target strain to isolate the phages. Thirty-six phages were isolated and purified from a total of 51 surface water samples collected in Shanghai. All phages were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and their host ranges were evaluated. Three phages, designated φXWY0013, φXWY0014 and φXWY0026 were selected and further characterised using one-step growth curve and stability at different temperatures and pH.Results and conclusions: The isolated phages are promising for use as antimicrobials against bacterial canker in kiwi.

Chickpea, field bean, pea, and white lupin were harvested at flowering and maturity to compare the relative contribution of BNF, soil N uptake, and N remobilisation to seed N. From flowering to maturity, shoot dry weight increased in all crops by approximately 50%, root did not appreciably change, and nodule decreased by 18%. The amount of plant N increased in all crops, however in field bean (17 g m−2) it was about twice that in chickpea, pea, and lupin. The increase was entirely due to seeds, whose N content at maturity was 26 g m−2 in field bean and 16 g m−2 in chickpea, pea, and lupin. The seed N content at maturity was higher than total N accumulation during grain filling in all crops, and endogenous N previously accumulated in vegetative parts was remobilised to fulfil the N demand of filling seeds. Nitrogen remobilisation ranged from 7 g m−2 in chickpea to 9 g m−2 in field bean, and was crucial in providing N to the seeds of chickpea, pea, and lupin (half of seed N content) but it was less important in field bean (one-third). All the vegetative organs of the plants underwent N remobilisation: shoots contributed to the N supply of seeds from 58% to 85%, roots from 11% to 37%, and nodules less than 8%. Improving grain legume yield requires either reduced N remobilisation or enhanced N supply, thus, a useful strategy is to select cultivars with high post-anthesis N2 fixation or add mineral N at flowering.",

Higher soluble solid concentrations occurred in years with high summer temperatures and radiation, while anthocyanins concentrations were negatively correlated with summer temperature. Furthermore, a negative correlation between phenolic compounds and radiation in June and July was observed. Temperature and radiation in late spring and summer were also negatively correlated with ascorbic acid concentration, while precipitation during summer was highly positively correlated with this important vitamin.

As expected, in both species a higher concentration of soluble carbohydrates were observed in sprigs tissues. A sharp decline was evident on the treatment in leaves, stems, and roots tissues at 14 days, in correspondence with a lower freeze tolerance, whereas in the treatment an accumulation in total soluble sugars was observed in rhizomes at 28 days. Over the time, chlorophylls showed a slight increase in the treatment, while an opposite trend was detected in the treatment. Overall, N source provided consistent differences in freeze tolerance in both species.",

    "abstract": "Three sweet potato cultivars (A40, A45 and 199062.1) were planted in three small-scale farms located under different agro-ecological zones of KwaZulu-Natal. The objective was to assess growth, physiological responses and yield of the sweet potato cultivars under low-input agricultural system and different environmental conditions. Sweet potato planted at Richards Bay (28°19'S; 32°06E), a coastal sandy soil location, recorded low stomatal conductance(SC; 102.2 m moles m−2 s−1) and chlorophyll content index (CCI; 29.4). This consequently resulted in reduced vine length, leaf number and branching of sweet potato plants. Environmental conditions in that location (Richards Bay) such as high evapotranspiration, high temperatures and low water retention capacity of sandy soils created drought stress condition. This caused reduction in photosynthetic activities and translocation to the harvestable plant parts. The other two locations (Deepdale at 28°01'S; 28°99'E and Umbumbulu at 29°98'S; 30°70'E) located further from the coast and characterized by clayey soils recorded higher SC and CCI. Branching and number of leaves were significantly influenced by locations and growing season while vine length varied with locations, indicating specific varietal adaptation. Biomass and storage root yield followed a similar trend as plant growth and physiology. Richards Bay recorded very low biomass and storage root yield (5.4 and 5.0 t ha−1) in both seasons while Deepdale recorded higher yields (42.0 t ha−1) during the first growing season. Yields reduced by 67% (13.6 t ha−1) in the second season. Storage root yields from Umbumbulu were stable in both growing seasons (29.4 and 28 t ha−1 during seasons one and two, respectively). Adding fertilizer only improved storage roots yield in Richards Bay, otherwise cultural practises were responsible for storage root yield increases in Deepdale and Umbumbulu. Orange-fleshed sweet potato cultivar A45 showed good environmental plasticity while cultivar 199062.1 responded well to fertilizer application. This indicated its suitability for use in food security programmes under low-input agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is an important horticultural plant in intensive agriculture. Many pests and pathogens affect tomato worldwide. Root-knot nematodes (RKNs) are considered to be one of the most important pathogen groups. Development of resistant tomato varieties to nematode provides an economically and environmentally approach for the management of nematodes. The Mi-1 gene confers resistance to RKNs in tomato. Since resistance testing to RKN is time consuming, laborious, and costly, molecular markers linked to the resistance gene have been developed for breeding purposes. Mi-1 gene is located on short arm of chromosome 6 and very tightly linked to Ty-1 gene. The genomic region containing Mi-1 and Ty-1 is genetically very short. Therefore, there is problem introgressions of plants bearing both Mi-1 and Ty-1. Therefore, some markers such as Rex used for screening of Mi-1 gene can give false-positive results in plants with some of the begomovirus-resistant germplasm derived from Ih902, which has begomovirus-resistance genes introgressed from Solanum habrochaites. Although molecular markers tightly linked to Mi-1 gene have been developed, they have not been applied to a wide range of plants carrying Ty-1 gene or not carrying Ty-1, and compared with each other. In the present study, these markers have been employed in tomato lines and hybrids carrying Ty-1 gene or not carrying Ty-1, and evaluated with each other. A total of 116 tomato plants were tested by markers JB-1, Rex, PMi12, and Mi23. The JB-1 yielded accurate results in all the genotypes tested. Markers Rex, PMi12, and Mi23 gave consistent results in plants that do not have Ty-1 gene. PMi12 and Mi23 also produced logical findings for plants carrying Ty-1. However, marker Rex-1 produced false-positive results in other samples bearing Ty-1 gene, except four plants. Our findings showed that both PMi12 and Mi23 markers can be suggested for screening of RKN resistance in tomato-breeding programs.",

The use of resistant sorghum varieties compatible with Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. strigae (FOS), a biocontrol agent of Striga, may supress the weed and enhance the crop productivity. The objective of this study was to screen and select farmer-preferred sorghum genotypes for Sh and Sa resistance and FOS compatibility for resistance breeding under Tanzanian conditions. Sixty sorghum genotypes were evaluated under screen house conditions using Sh- and Sa-infested field soils with controlled seed infestation, with or without inoculation of the sorghum seeds with FOS. Inoculation of sorghum seeds with FOS significantly enhanced sorghum growth and productivity, and supressed Sh and Sa growth and development. There were reductions of 1–4 Sh and Sa plants when sorghum seeds were inoculated with FOS. Overall, we selected 25 promising sorghum lines resistant to Sh and/or Sa, and with FOS compatibility. The selected sorghum lines are valuable genetic resources for the development of Striga management in sorghum through the integrated use of host resistance and FOS inoculation.",

The effects on hybrid buckwheat plants of full (+UV) and reduced (−UV) ambient UV radiation without (−Se) and with (+Se) foliar Se treatment (10 mg L−1 sodium selenate) provided the four conditions of Se−UV–, Se–+UV, +Se−UV and +Se+UV. Plant morphological, biochemical and physiological properties were examined, along with leaf elemental composition and content, efficiency of Se enrichment, and production parameters. Leaf anatomical parameters under all conditions were mainly affected by UV radiation, and less so by Se. +Se+UV plants showed a trade-off between primary and secondary metabolism, which resulted in high levels of protective substances (e.g. anthocyanins, UV absorbing compounds), and low levels of photosynthetic pigments. All +UV plants were significantly shorter in comparison to those under the reduced −UV, while biomass production was highest for −Se+UV plants and lowest for +Se+UV plants. +Se plants accumulated ∼20-fold greater Se content compared to −Se plants, and full ambient UV radiation partly reduced this effect. +UV plants showed increased phosphorus content in leaves, independent of Se status, while +Se plants showed increased K content. Si content was increased by Se treatment and decreased by the full UV exposure. Se treatment and the ambient UV radiation, separately have positive effects on growth and production of this hybrid buckwheat, while the combination of the Se treatment and ambient UV resulted in lower yields. However, under these conditions (+Se+UV), the buckwheat plants established good protection against the different environmental constraints that are becoming more and more frequent due to changes to our climate.",

    "abstract": "Salt and alkali stress limit crop growth and reduce agricultural productivity worldwide, which have led to increased interest in enhancing salt tolerance in crop plants. Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (Linn.) Moench) is a monocotyledonous crop species that shows greater tolerance to salt–alkali stress than most other crops, although the underlying mechanisms behind this tolerance remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of salt and alkali stresses on two sweet sorghum varieties M-81E, which is stress tolerant, and 314B, which is stress sensitive. Namely, we surveyed plant growth parameters, measured Na+ and K+ distributions at the level of the whole plant as well as in three specific tissues, and then determined the activities of H+-ATPase, H+-PPase and Na+/H+ exchange in root vacuole membranes under stress conditions. Following treatment of the seedlings for 3 days with salt or alkali solutions, the plant growth was inhibited and Na+ levels in the whole plant, leaves, sheath, and roots were increased in both genotypes. Under alkali stress, K+ levels in the whole plant, leaves, sheath, and roots were decreased in both genotypes. M-81E roots accumulated significantly higher levels of Na+ than leaves, whereas the opposite was true for 314B. Under salt stress, both the hydrolytic and proton-transporting activities of V-H+-ATPase were enhanced and Na+/H+ exchange activity was dramatically upregulated, whereas V-H+-PPase activity was decreased. M-81E showed a greater capacity to compartmentalize Na+ within root cell vacuoles and maintain higher levels of K+ uptake compared with 314B, resulting in higher K+/Na+ transport selectivity in this genotype. These results also demonstrated that H+-ATPase activity and ionic homeostasis (Na+/K+) were likely important contributors to the tolerance of saline-alkali stress and crucially important for understanding alkaline stress in both crops and wild plants.",

Thus, the present study is aimed to investigate the DNA damage levels and the DNA methylation changes in Phaseolus vulgaris subjected to whether dicamba and humic acids (HAs) have any protective effect on these changes. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and Coupled Restriction Enzyme Digestion-Random Amplification (CRED-RAs) were used to determinate the DNA damage levels and the changes in the pattern of DNA methylation. The results showed that dicamba (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 ppm) caused RAPDs profile changes (DNA damage) as increasing, genomic template stability (GTS) as decreasing and DNA hypomethylation. However, these effects of dicamba seen at higher levels decreased after treatment with five different concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8 and10%) of HAs. The results of this experiment have clearly shown that HAs could be used effectively to protect bean seedlings from the destructive effects of dicamba.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the sensitivity of tomato yield and water use efficiency (WUE) to soil water content at different growth stages, the central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed in a five-factor-five-level pot experiment under regulated deficit irrigation. Two regression models concerning the effects of stage-specific soil water content on tomato yield and WUE were established. The results showed that the lowest available soil water (ASW) content (around 28%) during vegetative growth stage (here denoted θ1) resulted in high yield and WUE. Moderate (around 69% ASW) during blooming and fruit setting stage (θ2), and the highest ASW (around 92%) during early fruit growth stage (θ3), fruit development (θ4) and fruit maturity (θ5) contributed positively to tomato yield, whereas high WUE was achieved at lower θ2 and θ3 ( around 44% ASW) and higher θ4 and θ5 (around 76% ASW). The strongest coupling effects of ASW in two growth stages were between θ2 and θ5, θ3. In both cases a moderate θ2 was a precondition for maximum yield response to increasing θ5 and θ3. Sensitivity analysis revealed that yield was most sensitive to soil water content at fruit maturity (θ5). Numerical inspection of the regression model showed that the maximum yield, 1166 g per plant, was obtained by the combination of θ1 (c. 28% ASW), θ2 (c. 82% ASW), θ3 (c. 92% ASW), θ4 (c. 92% ASW), and θ5 (c. 92% ASW). This result may guide irrigation scheduling to achieve higher tomato yield and WUE based on specific soil water contents at different growth stages.",

The water use efficacies (WUEs) were examined in term of technical, economical and hydraulic water use efficiencies for the both conservation tillage under irrigated conditions. The results indicated that both the conservation tillage techniques showed positive effect (P ≤ .05) on the WUEs. The tied-ridging gave the highest values of WUEs than ridging for all crops. Moreover, tied-ridging increased the average values of water use efficiency by 75%, 48%, 17% and 85% for cotton, sorghum, groundnut and wheat, respectively, compared to that of control treatment, which significantly differed from the ridging treatment. Accordingly, conservation tillage improved WUE and the capability of soil to keep moisture which is reflected in high crops production. This suggests that there is substantial scope for improving irrigation water use efficiency of crops by adoption of conservation tillage.",

    "abstract": "Cowpea is an important food and nutritional security grain legume crop in the semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Its production is limited by biotic factors including pre-harvest insect pests such as aphids. Aphids cause yield reductions, promotes the growth of sooty moulds, honeydew and as a result reduce photosynthetic processes and rates. Various methods have been deployed to try to control the damage of aphids in cowpea plants. The methods include the use of chemical insecticides, cultural, mechanical, biological controls and integrated pest management. However, these methods have not been very effective as smallholder farmers growing cowpea in marginal areas cannot afford them. Hence, host plant resistance/genetic control is the best and effective method for controlling aphids in cowpea plantations. Breeding for aphid resistance is one of the effective methods that can sustain the production and productivity of the cowpea for longer periods. Furthermore, assessing the presence of genetic diversity can also help in sourcing genes of novelty for addressing this important issue to increase the production and productivity of the crop. Recently, scientists have used various strategies to try to solve the challenge of aphid damage on cowpea. The objective of this review was to document the research progresses on aphid resistance breeding of cowpea to facilitate the breeding and conservation of cowpea germplasm. The review serves as a baseline information to guide future cowpea breeding for resistance to aphids.",

Afterwards, the above-ground biomass was cut and incorporated in equal quantities (0.2 g C kg–1 of soil or 176 kg C ha–1) in the same soil and incubated for 30 days. The soil aggregate stability increased significantly with barley before harvesting and rye at day 30 after cover crop residues incorporation. The cover crop plant growth did not influence the soil acid phosphatase activity (APA) before biomass harvesting. Instead, the cover crop residues increased the soil APA only for a short period. The negative correlation between soil aggregate stability and APA can be explained by the variability in soil moisture.

A total of 1175 specimens belonging to 29 species of Carabidae were caught during a five-week trapping period, which gave an average of 0.68 specimens per trap day. Carabids together with staphylinids were more numerous than spiders. Bembidion guttula was the dominant species, but Clivinafossor and Bembidion quadrimaculatum also occurred abundantly during the establishment phase of the aphids. Three weeks later, during the population peak of the aphids, Bembidion spp. had declined and Amara plebeja was the most numerous species in the catch Gut dissections showed that Bembidion spp. and C. fossor had predated on R. padi just after the first colonists had arrived. Together with aphids, Collembola and other soil animals comprised the food typical of Bembidion spp. During the aphid peak, a high percentage of A. plebeja and Harpalus rufipes had consumed aphids. These species more often than the others had also ingested plant material. It was suggested that the mid-season generalist predators, together with aphid specialists, contribute to suppressing the population growth of R. padi, but that the early-season predators, especially Bembidion spp., create an important buffer against colonizing aphids. Their relative efficiency is based on the high predator/prey ratio.",

The percentage of FAA in the dry matter increased in relation to the centrality of leaves in the bulb but was independent of storage time.

The catch crops were ploughed in in late October, and the after-effect on succeeding spring wheat or barley crops was determined. The catch crops were more competitive in 1986, when rainfall in spring was abundant, than in 1985, when it was low. Ryegrass was stimulated by N fertilizer, whereas the clovers were repressed owing to increased shading. At ploughing, catch-crop biomass N ranged from 17 to 94, 37 to 155 and 41 to 243 kg N ha−1 for ryegrass, white clover and subterranean clover, respectively. Grain yields (mean of N-fertilized plots), respectively, ranged from 83 to 94, 84 to 110 and 84 to 100% of yields in monoculture. The catch crops reduced weeds. The fertilizer replacement value of ploughed-in white clover was 50–60 kg N ha−1 on loam soil without N fertilizer. Fertilizer N given either of the years decreased the grain yield response to white clover. Yet, the grain yield with white clover plus 60 kg N ha−1 exceeded that on plots receiving 120 kg N ha−1 as mineral fertilizer only. On sandy loam, the aftereffect was much smaller, most likely owing to N loss during wet conditions in the spring. The effect of ryegrass was neutral and that of subterranean clover intermediate.

    "abstract": "The main objective was to compare the response of grain yield to fertiliser N in a winter wheat-white clover intercropping system with the response in wheat alone. Clover was undersown in spring barley and remained established in two consecutive crops of wheat in two field experiments. Clover reduced grain yield in the first crop of wheat and increased it in the second. There was more inorganic N in the soil and a higher concentration of N in the grains in the intercropping system. The grain and N yield response to fertiliser N was equal or less with intercropped than with wheat alone. The reduction of clover biomass with a herbicide increased grain yield of the first crop of wheat without reducing the clover biomass or the positive residual effect in the second wheat crop. It was concluded that in order to produce large grain yields, competition from clover needs to be kept small when wheat is at the tillering stage.

The experiment was designed as a split-plot with three replications in which planting dates were the main plots and cotton cultivars were subplots. Five planting dates were established at about 15-day intervals from mid-April to mid-June (15 April, 1 May, 15 May, 1 June, and 15 June). Data collected in both years indicated that planting on 15 April increased the seed cotton yield by 15%. 1 June planting resulted in lower yield (28%), micronaire (15%) and strength (10%) compared to 1 May. Short fibre content was 35% higher for the 15 June planting than for 1 May planting. Cultivar responses differed with planting date. The existence of cultivar×planting date interaction on yield highlights the importance of selecting the right cultivar for the specified planting date. An early planting production system for cotton has the potential to increase yield and quality. Planting cotton as a second crop after cereals could also be feasible for the regions which have an expanding textile industry, although yield and quality are not as high as in crops grown at optimum planting date.",

However, 38.1 t ha−1 sludge applications increased leaf Pb and Zn. DTPA-extractable Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn concentrations of the soil increased at applications of 38.1 t ha−1 sewage sludge, whereas applications of 9.5 t and 19.0 t ha−1 sludge only resulted in elevated levels of Cu and Zn, We conclude that if sewage sludge is to be used in production of maize, applications rate up to 19 t ha−1 could be accepted. However, this means also that the N requirement of maize crop is not covered by the sludge; therefore, the rest of nitrogen could be supplied as inorganic N.",

There is increasing demand for new and economically valuable blackcurrant cultivars suitable for organic production. To meet this demand, potential candidates of blackcurrant cultivars have been studied under Estonian field conditions. Our aim was to evaluate blackcurrant cultivars with regard to their productivity, berry quality, and resistance to the blackcurrant gall mite (Cecidophyopsis ribis Westw.). Our results showed that the drop of berries was the highest in the control treatment (no fertilizers used), and the lowest in conventional treatment. Higher yields were obtained from the conventional and organic treatments. The most productive cultivar, with the biggest berries and highest ascorbic acid content irrespective of cultivation system, was the cultivar 'Pamyati Vavilova'. Organically cultivated berries had a higher content of ascorbic acid than did conventionally cultivated berries. Minor damage by mites was observed on the cultivar 'Öjebyn'. We conclude that blackcurrant is a suitable crop for organic cultivation and that the cultivars 'Pamyati Vavilova' and 'Zagadka' respond well to organic cultivation. The cultivar 'Öjebin' is not considered to be well adapted for organic growing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is an increasing demand for organically grown pulses and cereal grains in Denmark, which is expected to cause a change in the typical organic farm structure away from dairy farming and towards arable farming. Spring field beans (Vicia faba) could be a popular break crop in organic agriculture. The black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) is generally considered to be a serious pest of spring-sown field beans in northern Europe, and field studies have shown that yield losses can exceed more than 50% due to attacks from the black bean aphid. The use of insecticides in organically grown field bean crops is not permitted, but it has been known for a long time that the black bean aphid infests different varieties of beans to a very different extent. Therefore, partial resistance to the black bean aphid is one method of stabilizing yields. Another method of cultural pest control is intercropping and a third method could be a combination of both. Six field experiments involving the three methods were carried out. There was a significant difference between the number of aphids per plant on the three investigated bean varieties, where 'Colombo' was the most susceptible, 'Quattro' was intermediate, and 'Caspar' the most resistant variety. 'Colombo' intercropping with spring wheat and spring barley reduced the numbers of aphids per plant significantly, and also the number of plants infested. The harvesting of all crops took place during the last fourteen days of August. It can be concluded that the growing of partial host plant resistant varieties of field beans or the intercropping of field beans with spring cereals separately will reduce the infestation with black bean aphids. If both methods are used, the reduction of infestation will be even higher and consequently also the yield.",

Recently, legume bacteria (Rhizobium spp.) have been reported to act as PGPR. In this study, we investigated the potential use of legume bacteria as PGPR in nonlegumes by inoculating eight different rhizobial strains onto mixtures of six botanically different non-nitrogen-fixing plant species. Each seed mixture was inoculated before sowing with the same concentration of the respective rhizobial strain. The results showed that inoculation with certain rhizobial strains increased plant biomass. In a follow-up experiment, we investigated the importance of cell density of the rhizobial inoculant by inoculating seeds of one species (Linum usitatissimum) with only one rhizobial strain, but at different concentrations. A concentration of level 104 c.f.u. (colony-forming units) mL−1 proved to be the best for successful growth. A supplementary in vitro study investigating potential mechanisms behind the plant stimulatory effect of rhizobia found that some rhizobial strains have a capability to dissolve the fungal mycelium at the initial stage. These results demonstrate that certain rhizobial strains have interesting features that deserve further attention when evaluating and developing biological plant-protection systems and/or plant-stimulating agents.",

The objectives were (1) to examine the seasonal patterns of rhizome growth and nutrient dynamics of the energy crop reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) in ley I and II, and (2) to evaluate the roles of soil type (mineral vs. organic), fertilisation level (0, 50, and 100 kg N ha−1s), and season/harvest time (Oct-96, May-97, and Aug-97) on the rhizome growth and nutrient dynamics by means of a factorially designed experiment. The general pattern of rhizome growth was that biomass was low in June during initiation of shoot growth, but increased steadily during the growing season, reached a peak in late autumn, and remained high until next spring. The N and P accumulation in rhizomes followed a similar pattern. During ley years I and II, reed canary grass rhizome growth was less dependent on soil type, and more dependent on fertilisation and season, with fertilisation being the most important predictor of growth. The season/harvest time, followed by soil type, was the most important factor for both concentrations and therefore total uptake of N, P, and K in rhizomes. Soil type affected N content in rhizomes significantly, and also interacted with season and enhanced the effect on N, P, and K content in rhizomes. The seasonal dynamics of the nutrient content in rhizomes indicate a remobilisation of the nutrients from rhizomes to the regrowth of shoots and roots in spring and relocation/storage from aboveground shoots to rhizomes during late summer and autumn. The results of this study suggest that delaying the harvest to later than October would result in considerably more energy and nutrient resources being translocated from aboveground shoots to rhizomes for growth in the next season.",

    "abstract": "Finland is the only country in which summer turnip rape (Brassica rapa L.) is predominant over oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) as an oil crop. However, farmer interest in growing oilseed rape has increased significantly over recent years. Accordingly, this study aims to compare the regional risks of producing turnip rape and oilseed rape in order to avoid setbacks in Finnish vegetable oil production. This study is especially topical because the cultivated area of Brassica oil crops is projected to double in the near future and recent years have particularly favoured oilseed rape production and farmers have been encouraged to replace turnip rape with oilseed rape. Using information gained through this risk assessment, changes in oil crop production can be managed in a more economically sustainable way. In this study we used long-term datasets from MTT Agrifood Research Finland (MTT Official Variety Trials for 1976–2005) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (regional datasets for temperature accumulation and occurrence of frosts at late seed ripening for 1971–2000). According to the results of this risk assessment, sustainable and economically feasible oil crop production in Finland must currently be based primarily on turnip rape. Oilseed rape is, however, likely to become increasingly important, but in the most favourable fields of the southernmost production regions. However, it was evident that comparison of yield values is very sensitive to variety differences for the most critical yield parameters. Hence, when introducing new oilseed rape varieties it is particularly important that they always have equal or better seed yield and seed chlorophyll content than the recently introduced, markedly improved oilseed rape varieties. This will reduce economic risks for farmers.",

A total of 132 discernible loci were obtained for all populations using 10 primers, and 88.64% of these loci were polymorphic, which indicated that a high diversity existed in the cultivars from Northwest China. Analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) showed that the majority of the genetic variation was within cultivars (60.4%), with a relatively smaller proportion being due to the differences between cultivars (39.6%). The smallest genetic distance (0.0813) was estimated between cultivars Gannong-2 and Zhonglan-1, while the largest (0.2840) was between cultivars Gannong-1 and Tianshui.

To understand the ecological linkages between the non-growing and growing seasons, soil C and nutrients were measured in the primary fir (Abies faxoniana) forest, fir and birch (Betula albosinensis) mixed forest and secondary fir forest in the subalpine/alpine regions of western China. Soils were sampled as soil thawing proceeded from 5 March, 15 March, 25 March, 5 April and 15 April to 25 April 2009, based on monitored soil temperatures. Frequencies of temperature fluctuations (below and above 0 °C) during the soil thawing period depended on the altitude. The soil organic layer showed higher contents and stocks of C, N and P compared with the mineral soil layer. Since the soil organic layer was more directly exposed to environmental changes, the variations of soil C and nutrients in the soil organic layer were more apparent than those in the mineral soil layer. The fluctuations of soil C and nutrients varied with the altitude during soil thawing period. Soil C and nutrient concentrations decreased sharply at the beginning of soil thawing, and thereafter increased in the mixed and secondary forest, which were different to the changes in the primary forest. Soil available nutrients, except for −N in the primary forest, showed an increasing tendency in the early stage of the thawing period, but soil available N and P decreased in the later stage of the thawing period. The increasing soil temperature had little effect on soil nutrient availability during the thawing period. The results indicated that soil carbon and nutrients were significantly affected by the length of freeze–thaw period, which is beneficial towards understanding the interactions between wintertime and the growing season.",

Because of a changed seed potato growing strategy, the seed potato area in Denmark is changing from regions with a low average temperature to regions with a higher average temperature. This means that the aphids may infest the potato crops earlier and the population development of the aphids may be faster, and consequently PVY may more easily become epidemic in seed potato crops. With a view to reducing the spread of PVY a 3-year experiment was carried out with a combination of mineral oil and insecticides. In 2005 and 2007 when a very high number of aphids were present, nearly all plants were infected with PVY. In 2006 with a lower number of aphids a smaller proportion of the plants were infected, and a tendency to a lower PVY incidence in mineral-oil treated plots was found, but more than the 8% threshold value. Even in plots where systemic neonicotinoids were applied and very few aphids were recorded, no significant reduction in infestation level of PVY was found. The present experiment shows that mineral oil and insecticides applied to potato crops each week for a 6-week period as protection against aphid transmission of PVY did not significantly reduce the level of PVY infestations in potatoes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rapid and uniform crop establishment is a prerequisite for efficient crop production and minimal environmental impact. Experiments were carried out in shallow plastic boxes placed directly on the ground in the field for studies of the effects of seedbed properties on emergence of various crops. This paper presents an analysis of the time required for germination and emergence under near-optimal seedbed conditions. The crops studied were barley, oats, wheat, pea, rape seed, white mustard, sugar beet, red clover and timothy. The time required for germination generally increased with size of the seeds, presumably because larger seeds needed more water to initiate germination. This applied both when comparing different crops and different seed sizes of the same crop. However, considerable differences occurred between seed lots of the same crop and there were greater differences between seed lots of the same crop than between the three small grain crops studied. Growth rate of the seedlings generally increased with seed size, presumably because of increased energy content in the seed. Consequently, the most rapid emergence was obtained from small seeds at shallow sowing and from large seeds at deep sowing. The crops studied had a minimum temperature for germination and seedling growth close to 0 °C. Under optimal seedbed conditions, thermal time required for 50% germination of barley was typically about 65 °C days over this base temperature and for seedling growth about 6 °C days cm−1. From 4 cm sowing depth, about 80 °C days were required for emergence but with considerable variations between seed lots. For rape seed or white mustard about 40 °C days were required for germination and about 8 °C days cm−1 for the seedling growth.",

It considers the range of externalities or ‘drivers for change’ facing the industry, and the challenges and opportunities available for promoting and achieving more sustainable turfgrass management within the sports, landscape and amenity sectors. The analysis confirms that there are a number of key areas where a concerted research and industrial effort is required. These include responding to the pressures from government demands for greater environmental regulation, the increasing pressure on natural resources (notably water, energy and land), the emerging role of turf management in supporting ecosystem services and enhancing biodiversity, the continued need to promote integrated pest management, and the looming challenges posed by a changing climate, and urgent need to adapt. Whilst many of these externalities appear to be risks to the sports turf industry, there will also be significant opportunities, for those where the labour, energy and agronomic costs are minimized and where the drive to adopt a multifunctional approach to sportsturf management is embraced.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently there has been more focus on food in general and local food in particular. But what is local food? And what are the perceptions of this concept according to theory and to providers and consumers of local food? This article first summarises and compares three different theoretical perspectives on local food, namely experience economy, local food systems and what is termed pro-industrialism. These have differing and sometimes opposite conceptualisations and aims for the concept of local food. Using the perspective of experience economy as theoretical background, the concept of local food as expressed by a group of Danish providers and consumers is empirically investigated through interviews, observation and surveys. From this, qualitative and quantitative data are generated, the analysis of which shows how varied perceptions of local food are. The elements of which the perceptions consist are identified and then categorised according to whether they pertain to the food product itself or the production methods and facilities and whether they describe physical or social properties of local food. From this a model with four categories is developed. It is found that properties of the product are more frequently mentioned than properties of the production process. Providers emphasise social properties of the product more often than consumers, and consumers emphasise physical properties of the product more often than providers. Inversely, providers emphasise physical properties of production more than consumers, who emphasise social properties of production more than providers. Experience marketing and events may create diffusion of a local food concept, but only when communication is massive and long-lasting. So far this has not been the case, hence there is no agreement in either theory or among the providers and consumers studied on what local food is. However, this may change in time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil erosion by water is currently one of the most notable types of land degradation in Samanalawewa Watershed in Sri Lanka, creating copious environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Thus, with the aim of detecting and mapping the rates of human-induced soil erosion in the watershed, remote sensing and geographic information system based modelling and field experiments were carried out. The results of the assessment disclosed that the present rate of human-induced soil erosion varies from 0 to 289 t ha−1 yr−1 with the majority of the area exceeding the natural rate of soil erosion by 14 to 33 times at present. However, the average rate of human-induced soil erosion has declined dramatically from 19.8 to 4.3 t ha−1 yr−1 from 1986 to 2008. In order to analyse the significant determinants of farm-level adoption of soil and water conservation measures, binary logistic regression procedure was applied using the data collected through a household survey (n = 201). The most significant (p<0.01) variables of the study were the farmers' perceptions of soil erosion problems, gender of the household head, training on soil and water conservation, and ascertained advice from agricultural extension officers while the variables regarding past awareness about soil conservation technologies and off-farm income were significant at p<0.05. Furthermore, the study revealed that the majority (60.2%) of the farmers in the study area had been adopting different types of soil and water conservation measures for a prolonged period of time. Therefore, owing to the current decreasing rate of soil erosion, the soil and water conservation costs and the ratios of human-induced soil erosion vs natural soil erosion had declined significantly while the productivity of their lands had gone up.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents water erosion data of three stationary series of field experiments (each analysing 10 land plots) on various steepness slopes with different soil texture of the hilly topography of Western Lithuania (Zemaiciai Upland). Six different erosion-preventive crop rotations (four field crop rotations and two perennial grasses for sward formation) were investigated. It was demonstrated that extent of water erosion depends on erosion-preventative capabilities of different crop rotations, slope gradient, soil texture and the amount of precipitations. According to the results of long-term experiments, the mean annual erosion rate under the grass–grain rotation decreased by 95.0% compared with crop rotation with black fallow. The annual soil loss (SL) due to water erosion in the crop rotation with bare fallow was estimated to be between 0.01 and 18.56 t ha−1 yr−1. Usage of long-term grass sward completely prevented soil erosion. Perennial grasses and grass−grain crop rotations also prevented soil erosion on slopes during rainstorm (41–65 mm of precipitation during the day). However, even grain–grass rotations could not completely prevent the water erosion on the 9°–11° slopes with light textured soils. SL rate in 5-year rotation was 1.64 and 1.41 t ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Soil water erosion and nutrient losses are effectively inhibited by long-lived perennial grasses. Covering slopes with erosion-preventive sward forming perennial grasses in many cases prevented available potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) loss from inside the soil, however, the K and P losses resulting from runoff were 0.005–1.0 and 0.001–0.071 kg ha−1, respectively.",

Results showed that SSA modified the chemical properties of mudflat soil by decreasing soil salinity and pH, increasing soil organic matter, total and available N and P, and heavy metals. The biomass of root and aboveground parts of ryegrass showed increments with increasing SSA rates. Maximum increases of 5.6- and 1.3-fold in fresh weight of aboveground parts and root of ryegrass were observed at 300 t ha−1 rate. Root grown at all SSA rates showed positive response to higher nutrient availability in the mudflat soil with increasing root average diameter and volume. The root length and surface area at 30 t ha−1 SSA rate was significantly higher than those in other treatments. The sewage sludge amendment increased N and P content in both aboveground and root parts of ryegrass. Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn accumulation in ryegrass was positively correlated with SSA rates. However, heavy metal concentrations in ryegrass did not exceed the safety standard for feed in China (GB 13078-1999), except for Cd at 300 t ha−1 SSA rate. The study suggests that sewage sludge can be applied for mudflat soil amendment, which provides an innovative solution pertaining to new arable land resources and solid waste disposal. The optimum SSA rate is 150 t ha−1 with maximum plant yield yet permissible metal accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Rice is the world's second most produced staple cereal crop after wheat. Currently, rice production and consumption have steadily increased in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To date, rice is the largest imported commodity crop in the region. The low productivity is due to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses, and socio-economic constraints. Among the biotic constraints, rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) is the most important constraint to rice in SSA. In SSA, RYMV causes yield losses ranging from 20% to 100%. Various control strategies (host resistance, cultural practices and chemicals) have been recommended to manage RYMV epidemics. RYMV disease management through generic crop protection chemicals is not economic nor is it successful due to the presence of a large number of vector species disseminating the virus. In addition, cultural practices are ineffective against RYMV because the virus is spread by several agents, including insect vectors. The use of RYMV resistant cultivars remains the most effective, economic and environmentally friendly method for resource poor farmers. However, RYMV resistant varieties have not yet been developed and deployed in SSA. The aim of this review was to present the main components in the development of rice cultivars with RYMV disease resistance. The paper provides a comprehensive review on the genetic variability of the RYMV, its epidemiology and control measures, and the gene action responsible for RYMV resistance.The review also summarises complementary genomic tools useful in RYMV disease resistance breeding.Successful breeding of rice for RYMV resistance depends on the availability of genes for stable resistance, knowledge of the genetics of the host and, the availability of efficient phenotyping and pathotyping methods, and understanding of the genes involved and their pattern of inheritance. Information presented in the review can serve as a reference guide for rice breeding emphasising RYMV resistance, high yields and farmers-preferred traits.",

This paper reports results from variety testing for putting greens in the southern Nordic zone comprising Denmark and coastal areas in south Sweden and south Norway, and the northern zone comprising Finland, Iceland and remaining regions of Sweden and Norway. Forty-one varieties of seven species/subspecies were compared from 2007 to 2010 at Apelsvoll (Norway, 61° 42′ N, 250 m asl) and Korpa (Iceland, 64° 09′ N, 30 m asl) (northern zone), and at Landvik, (Norway, 58° 11′ N, 12 m asl) (southern zone). Once established, the trials were mowed at 3 mm for Agrostis and 5 mm for Festuca, Poa and Lolium. Mean fertilizer rates were 1.7 kg N 100 m−2 yr−1 to A. stolonifera and 1.0 kg N 100 m−2 yr−1 to other species. No pesticides were used. On average for varieties within species, F. rubra, especially ssp. commutata, had significantly less winter damage (biotic and abiotic) than L. perenne and Agrostis sp. F. rubra also had significantly less in-season diseases (mainly Microdochium patch) than A. capillaris and A. canina in the southern zone and in comparison with all Agrostis sp. in the northern zone. On average for varieties, the ranking based on overall visual merit was F. rubra ssp. commutata>F. rubra ssp. litoralis>A. canina>A. stolonifera>A. capillaris>P. trivialis>L. perenne in the northern zone, and A. canina>A. stolonifera>F. rubra ssp. commutata>F. rubra ssp. litoralis>A. capillaris>L. perenne>P. trivialis in the southern zone. For pesticide-free management of putting greens, we recommend pure seed blends or F. rubra in both zones. Seed blends of A. stolonifera or A. canina, and seed mixtures of F. rubra and A. capillaris are compatible with IPM including limited fungicide use. Ranking lists of varieties are presented.",

A field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of irrigation water salinity and N application rate on soil properties and N2O emission in a drip-irrigated cotton field. The experiment included three levels of irrigation water salinity (0.35, 4.61, or 8.04 dS m−1) and two N application rates (0 or 360 kg N ha−1). The results showed that soil moisture, salinity, and concentrations increased significantly as water salinity increased, whereas soil pH and concentrations decreased.

In the unfertilized plots, N2O emission flux and cumulative N2O emission both increased as water salinity increased.

Correlation analysis showed that soil moisture, , and were positively correlated with N2O emission rate. In contrast, soil salinity and pH had no significant correlation with N2O emission rate.

To reduce the adverse effects of brackish or SW irrigation on soil N2O emission, farmers should evaluate management practices such as additional irrigation before cultivation in spring, or the alternate use of fresh and SW during irrigation.",

Here, a 15N tracing incubation study was conducted to investigate the rates of gross N mineralization, nitrification, and microbial immobilization of and in a paddy soil managed using different organic materials. Soil samples were collected from a rice field that has been under long-term study (30 years) and is receiving four different fertilizer treatments: no fertilizer (CK), chemical fertilizer (NPK), chemical fertilizer plus cattle manure (NPKM), and chemical fertilizer plus straw (NPKS). The samples were incubated with 15NH4NO3 or NH4 15NO3, and the results were calculated based on a 15N tracing model. The analysis showed that mineralization of labile and recalcitrant organic-N pools was significantly stimulated by NPKM and NPKS treatments, respectively, but not by NPK alone. Heterotrophic nitrification was negligible in all treatments. Therefore, the enhanced inorganic-N supply rates (total mineralization + heterotrophic nitrification) due to NPKM and NPKS application could be attributed to the increasing mineralization of the labile organic-N pool and recalcitrant organic-N pool, respectively. The rate of autotrophic nitrification rate was significantly increased by NPK and NPKM application, but not by NPKS application. However, both consumption rates (immobilization of and dissimilatory reduction to ) were low and unaffected by fertilizer application. Our results suggest that NPKM stimulated the processes of mineralization of the labile organic-N pool and autotrophic nitrification to increase accumulation in soil. In contrast, application of NPKS increased the rate of mineralization of recalcitrant organic-N pool but did not affect the autotrophic nitrification rate.",

    "abstract": "Elevated nutrient concentrations in streams in the Norwegian agricultural landscape may occur due to faecal contamination. Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been used conventionally as an indicator of this contamination; however, it does not indicate the source of faecal origin. This work describes a study undertaken for the first time in Norway on an application of specific host-associated markers for faecal source tracking of water contamination. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on Bacteroidales host-specific markers was employed for microbial source tracking (MST) to determine the origin(s) of faecal water contamination. Four genetic markers were used: the universal AllBac (Bacteroidales) and the individual specific markers BacH (humans), BacR (ruminants) and Hor-Bac (horses). In addition, a pathogenicity test was carried out to detect the top seven Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) serogroups. The ratio between each individual marker and the universal one was used to: (1) normalise the markers to the level of AllBac in faeces, (2) determine the relative abundance of each specific marker, (3) develop a contribution profile for faecal water contamination and (4) elucidate the sources of contamination by highlighting the dominant origin(s). The results of the qPCR MST analyses indicated the actual contributions of humans and animals to faecal water contamination. The pathogenicity test revealed that water samples were STEC positive at a low level, which was in proportion to the concentration of the ruminant marker. The outcomes were verified statistically by coupling the findings of major contamination sources with observations in the field regarding local land use (residential or agricultural). Furthermore, clear correlations between the human marker and E. coli counts as well as the ruminant marker and STEC quantity in faecally contaminated water were observed. The results of this study have the potential to help identify sources of pollution for targeted mitigation of nutrient losses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil erosion is considered a serious environmental problem in parts of Norway. The effect on water quality is the most important concern, and the improvement of water quality is the major aim for mitigation techniques and regulations on tillage. Documentation of effects of tillage practices therefore has a high priority. In this paper, results from five plot experiments are presented. They are all located in the grain-growing district in southeastern Norway on clay and loam soils. Tillage treatments for spring cereals and winter cereals are compared. The effect of tillage is pronounced on erodible soils. The results showed that annual average soil losses in surface runoff for autumn-tilled and spring-tilled plots were 7 and 0.8 t ha−1yr−1 at Bjørnebekk; 4.3 and 0.4 t ha−1yr−1 at Askim; 2.6 and 0.2 t ha−1yr−1 at Hellerud; 1.1 and 0.2 t ha−1yr−1 at Øsaker; and 0.18 and 0.1 t ha−1yr−1 at Syverud, respectively. The corresponding total phosphorus losses were 8.4 and 1.5 kg ha−1yr−1 at Bjørnebekk; 4.5 and 0.8 kg ha−1yr−1 at Askim; 3.0 and 0.8 kg ha−1yr−1 at Hellerud; 1.30 and 0.44 kg ha−1yr−1 at Øsaker; and 0.43 and 0.45 kg ha−1yr−1 at Syverud for autumn and spring tillage, respectively. The effects were less pronounced on soils with a lower erodibility, but reduced autumn tillage is the most effective way to mitigate soil erosion as well as total phosphorus losses. The study also showed that the total phosphorus losses are closely correlated with soil losses. The results show the importance of soil tillage for soil and phosphorus losses and suggest that farmers avoid autumn tillage on areas with high erosion risk.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the last years, 'Cuore di Bue' tomato has been one of the most important types requested from the market because of its special flesh texture and flavour, which is very pleasing to the consumer. The present study aims to verify if rootstock affects some specific qualitative traits of this tomato fruits during ripening process. The main quality traits during ripening of tomato fruits of cultivar 'Profitto' ungrafted and grafted on 'Beaufort' and 'Big Power' rootstocks were determined. Results showed that different ripening stages and grafting combinations affected, sometimes strongly, tomato fruits' quality. Among phenolics, gallic, cinnamic and p-coumaric acids declined during ripening, whereas chlorogenic, caffeic and ferulic acids increased in the last ripening stages. The quality of tomato fruits was also influenced by grafting. As far as quality parameters (colour, °Brix, electrical conductivity, pH, titratable acidity) and sugar content are concerned, there were significant differences. Strong differences are attributable also to the contents of phenolic acids. In particular, ungrafted Profitto plants showed more p-coumaric and caffeic acid content than the other two grafted treatments. Profitto and Profitto×Beaufort showed more chlorogenic and cinnamic acid than Profitto×Big Power variety. The last one variety showed a completely different chlorogenic acid accumulation pattern and contained more gallic and ferulic acid than the other two. The nutritional value of grape tomatoes 'Cuore di Bue' considerably increased with ripening stage. Grafting has a significant effect on various biochemical and nutritional properties in tomato fruit. Many chemical compounds related to the antioxidants group have been involved in these changes showing a significant decrease in grafted fruits. Concerning other parameters such as pH, EC and Brix, the graft leads to very small changes.",

The results showed that SPAD of new and expanded leaves were elevated by most of the hydroponic solutions under shading compared with the full nutrient solution, while no effect was demonstrated under non-shading. Additionally, lettuces under non-shading presented slightly higher leaf SPAD than those under shading. Nitrate concentrations of lettuce new leaves, expanded leaves and petiole were lowered significantly by all hydroponic solutions under shading and non-shading conditions compared with the full nutrient solution. Under non-shading, the efficiencies of seven hydroponic solutions varied largely, but no efficiency differences were showed under shading. N-free solution, 0.75 mM potassium sulphate solution and 5×10−5 mM ammonium molybdate solution functioned more efficiently in reducing nitrate concentration both in expanded leaves and petiole of lettuce before harvest. In conclusion, proper light intensity is a key important factor that determines the efficiencies of nitrogen-free hydroponic solution treatments in lowering nitrate concentrations in leaf blades and petioles of lettuce before harvest.",

    "abstract": "The cause for low maize yields in rain-fed production systems is usually associated with water stress due to perceived suboptimal seasonal precipitation. A modeling study using Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project modeling framework was conducted to determine the magnitude of rain-fed potential yield and yield gap of maize in the Wami River sub-basin, Tanzania. Primary and secondary data on soils, weather, management, and crop yields and cultivars were used. Data matrix search technique was used to calibrate CERES-Maize Crop System model against reported yield for each of 168 farms involved in this study. Then the individual farms' simulated yields, actual reported yields, and the resultant yield gaps were aggregated into ward-level averages. Model calibration was robust as there was a very close agreement between reported and simulated yield (R2 = 0.9). Actual yields reported from farm survey ranged from 50 kg ha−1 to 3600 kg ha−1 with an average of 860 kg ha−1. Simulated rain-fed potential yield was between 2073 kg ha−1 and 5443 kg ha−1 and a mean of 4033 kg ha−1. It is apparent therefore that there exists a wide maize yield gap of 79% with current management under rain-fed conditions. This suggests that there is a large scope of improving maize yields under rain-fed conditions. Narrowing the yield gaps would require an intensive soil fertility improvement in the study area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract By restricted access to manure, nitrogen (N) supply in organic agriculture relies on biological N-fixation. This study compares grain yields after one full-season green manure (FSGM) to yields with repeated use of a green-manure catch crop. At two sites in south-eastern Norway, in a simple 4-year rotation (oats/wheat/oats/wheat), the repeated use of ryegrass, clover, or a mixture of ryegrass and clover as catch crops was compared with an FSGM established as a catch crop in year 1. The FSGM treatments had no subsequent catch crops. In year 5, the final residual effects were measured in barley. The yield levels were about equal for grains with no catch crop and a ryegrass catch crop. On average, the green-manure catch crops increased subsequent cereal yields close to 30%. The FSGM increased subsequent cereal yields significantly in two years, but across the rotation the yields were comparable to those of the treatments without green-manure catch crop. To achieve acceptable yields under Norwegian conditions, more than 25% of the land should be used for full-season green manure, or this method combined with green-manure catch crops. The accumulated amount of N in aboveground biomass in late autumn did not compensate for the N removed by cereal yields. To account for the deficiency, the roots of the green-manure catch crops would have to contain about 60% of the total N (tot-N) required to balance the cereal yields. Such high average values for root N are likely not realistic to achieve. However, measurement of biomass in late autumn may not reflect all N made available to concurrent or subsequent main crops.",

However, nitrifying microorganisms responsible for specific nitrification process under different land-use soils remains unknown. Thus, we investigated the relative contribution of bacteria and fungi to specific soil nitrification in different land-use soils (coniferous forest, upland fields planted with corn and rice paddy) in humid subtropical region in China. 15N dilution technique in combination with selective biomass inhibitors and C2H2 inhibition method were used to estimate the relative contribution of bacteria and fungi to heterotrophic nitrification and autotrophic nitrification in the different land-use soils in humid subtropical region. The results showed that autotrophic nitrification was the predominant nitrification process in the two agricultural soils (upland and paddy), while the nitrate production was mainly from heterotrophic nitrification in the acid forest soil. In the upland soils, streptomycin reduced autotrophic nitrification by 94%, whereas cycloheximide had no effect on autotrophic nitrification, indicating that autotrophic nitrification was mainly driven by bacteria. However, the opposite was true in another agricultural soil (paddy), indicating that fungi contributed to the oxidation of NH4+ to NO3−. In the acid forest soil, cycloheximide, but not streptomycin, inhibited heterotrophic nitrification, demonstrating that fungi controlled the heterotrophic nitrification. The conversion of forest to agricultural soils resulted in a shift from fungi-dominated heterotrophic nitrification to bacteria- or fungi-dominated autotrophic nitrification. Our results suggest that land-use and management practices, such as the application of N fertilizer and lime, the long-term waterflooding during rice growth, straw return after harvest, and cultivation could markedly influence the relative contribution of bacteria and fungi to specific soil nitrification processes.",

The inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to alleviate this problem has been explored around the world. A pot experiment was conducted to assess the effects of AM fungi inoculation on the growth of two crops, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.), and the soil structure in a clay soil (lime concretion black soil). The results showed that AM fungi inoculation increased shoot nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations of maize by 32.4% and 17.0%, respectively. Soil alkali-hydrolyzable N and Olsen-P were 30.1% and 29.9% higher, respectively, in inoculated maize plants than in the corresponding uninoculated treatments for 30 days. No effect of AM fungi on nutrient uptake and soil-available nutrients was found for tomato plants. The NMWD (normalized mean weight diameter, an index to evaluate soil aggregates) values for tomato and maize plants inoculated with AM fungi were 46.2% and 17.7% higher, respectively, than uninoculated plants and the same trends were detected for soil organic carbon (SOC) content. A significant positive relationship was found between SOC and NMWD, indicating that increasing SOC might be one mechanism by which AM fungi improved soil structure. Our results suggested that AM fungi might not always benefit plant growth and nutrient absorption after inoculating for 30 days, but contributed to soil structure improvement even with low colonization.",

Soil electrical conductivity, pH, mineral nitrogen, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) profiles and carbon source utilization patterns under five annually past nitrogen rates (0, 348, 522, 696 and 870 kg nitrogen ha−1) were evaluated after the establishment of sweet corn during 1–1.5-month fallow period over three-year tomato/cucumber/celery rotations. The past nitrogen application rates exerted significant effects on soil electrical conductivity, pH, nitrate-nitrogen, ammonium-nitrogen and carbon source utilization patterns, but not on PLFAs profiles. The sweet corn had a significant effect on soil chemical properties, total and actinobacterial PLFAs, but not on carbon source utilization patterns. Soil electrical conductivity, nitrate-nitrogen and the total PLFAs decreased whilst soil organic carbon, pH and the actinobacterial PLFAs increased after the establishment of sweet corn. Soil microbial functional diversity from carbon source utilization patterns and actinobacterial PLFAs were greatest after the establishment of sweet corn at a 60% of the conventional nitrogen rate (i.e. 522 kg nitrogen ha−1). Soil electrical conductivity and ammonium-nitrogen were two key factors to determine carbon source utilization patterns, whilst soil pH was the key factor to determine PLFAs profiles. A combination of the catch crop sweet corn during summer fallow and a 60% of the conventional nitrogen rate is a sustainable pathway of utilizing greenhouse-based intensive vegetable soils in eastern China.",

However, in the organic farming systems this difference between barley types was less pronounced. The hull-less barley varieties cv Pihl and cv Irbe, along with both hulled varieties, had good yield stability across environments and were well adapted to both cropping systems. Hull-less barley varieties tended to contain more protein and β -glucans than hulled barley varieties.

Plant material included 44 accessions of bermudagrasses that were grouped in 'Wild', 'Improved' 'Hybrid' and 'Dwarf types'. Single spaced plants were transplanted in field plots in two locations in Italy (Pisa and Palermo) and allowed to establish without mowing. The following traits were determined: stolon growth rate, internode length, internode diameter and internode volume, phytomer dry weight, leaf width, colour, seed head production, above ground dry biomass, shoot density, horizontal stem density and node density. Establishment speed of accessions was also determined. Stolon growth rate was found to be the only parameter strongly correlated to establishment speed across all entries and for each of the phenotypic groups. Based on these results, stolon growth rate could be assumed as a good predictor of establishment speed for cultivars and ecotypes belonging to the Cynodon genus.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The aims of this article are to highlight pre-breeding procedures for identifying primary sources of Striga-resistance genes and to summarize complimentary breeding techniques that enhance partial resistance of maize varieties against Striga species.Materials and methods: The paper presented a comprehensive account of Striga screening and controlling techniques and highlighted the potential of integrating partial resistance with FOS to boost maize production and productivity in SSA.Results: Striga infestation is a major constraint to maize production and productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A lack of Striga-resistant maize varieties and the limited adoption of other control methods hinder effective and integrated control of the parasitic weed in maize and related cereal crops globally. Genetic resistance of maize should be complemented with the use of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. strigea (FOS), a biocontrol agent known to suppress Striga.Conclusions: A combined use of genetic resistance and FOS has remained largely unutilized in controlling Striga in Africa. A combination of conventional and molecular Striga-resistance breeding tools as well as the use of FOS are promising methods to effectively control Striga in SSA.",

Maximum, minimum, and mean soil temperatures were higher with all plastic mulches except for aluminum/black, in which the maximum soil temperature was similar to the one in bare soil. There was no difference in net photosynthesis and there was very little difference in nutrient concentration between plants in plastic mulches and plants in bare soil; however, early and total yield showed a higher (p ≤ 0.05) yield in all plastic mulches, and lower with bare soil and white/black plastic mulch. Our results confirm that soil mulching impacts the pickling cucumber yield. We suggest a carefull selection of the color plastic mulch.",

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of long‐term application of different types of organic amendments on soil P forms, P use efficiency and sorghum yields. A long term experiment established in 1980 at Saria in Burkina Faso, comparing the effects of manure, compost and sorghum straw was used. Manure and compost significantly increased organic P and resin‐P by about 35% and 64%, respectively after 10 and 32 years of sorghum cultivation, and HCl‐P after 32 years of cultivation compared to the control. Manure significantly increased NaHCO3-Pi and NaOH-Pi by 63% and 26%, respectively compared to the control. Sorghum straw had little effect on measured soil P forms. Manure and compost were the best in increasing sorghum grain yield, which effect were strongly correlated to soil pH, carbon and nitrogen. The partial factors productivities of P resulting from the application of studied organic amendments were similar and low, but significantly higher than that of the control treatment. Organic amendments with high P content, maintaining soil carbon and pH could be used to improve soil P availability, sorghum yield and reduce the demand for mineral phosphorus fertilizers.",

Purpose: To understand whether the effects of countermeasures regulating N transformation varied with the prevailing soil N transformation characteristics. Materials and methods: The effects of nitrapyrin, rice straw and its biochar applications on N dynamics at the beginning stage (first 24 h) of a zonal acid soil (JX soil, pH 5.26) and a non-zonal alkaline soil (SC soil, pH 7.62) from the humid subtropics in China were investigated via a 15N tracing laboratory incubation. Results and conclusions: Rice straw incorporation affected almost all processes involved in and production and consumption, and decreased the net mineralisation and nitrification rates in both soils significantly. Nitrapyrin decreased the net nitrification rates in both studied soils by affecting different N transformation processes. In the SC soil, nitrapyrin reduced the net nitrification rate by inhibiting the gross autotrophic nitrification rate while the gross autotrophic nitrification in the JX soil was negligible and nitrapyrin decreased its net nitrification via a stimulation of the gross rate of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Biochar stimulated the gross rates of mineralisation, immobilisation, autotrophic nitrification and DNRA significantly, but did not affect the net mineralisation and nitrification rates in both soils. Countermeasures to regulate N transformations are tightly linked to the prevailing soil N transformation characteristics and should be taken into account for the recommendation of suitable management options.",

Tulip is one of the most important ornamental plants and its production technology is constantly being improved. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of AgNPs on growth and yield attributes of tulip cv. 'Pink Impression'. Before planting, the tulip 'Pink Impression' bulbs were soaked in the following concentrations of AgNPs: 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg L-1. Control bulbs were soaked in deionized water. The plants were forced in a greenhouse for two growing seasons. The tulips treated with 100 mg L−1 AgNPs flowered earlier, had longer cut-flower stem, larger petals, greater stem diameter and cut-flower fresh weight. Moreover, at this concentration of AgNPs, they showed increased leaf greenness index (SPAD), stomatal conductance, root fresh weight, root length and produced daughter bulbs of the greatest weight. The study outcomes indicate that AgNPs may be used as plant growth promoters in horticulture.",

However, the effectiveness of hydroponic screening methods needs to be verified under the soil condition of the field or pot. In the present study, root traits and NUE were investigated in 19 genotypes under two conditions (hydroponic and pipe filled with soil). Both environments revealed large variability for root traits and NUE under high and low N conditions establishing the absence of any direct selection for these traits in the past. Under both sets of experimentation, NUpE was largely responsible for improved nitrogen efficiency mainly because of higher root biomass. The significant association between the two screening methods i.e. hydroponic and pot filled with soil under both low and high N condition support large scale screening for root traits under hydroponic condition.",

    "abstract": "There is uncertainty regarding the suitability of some soils for mole drainage. Soils with questionable potential for the formation of stable mole channels generally have <45% clay and >20% sand, and gravel mole drainage is an alternative. However, this technique is unattractive due to its relative cost (2014 price: €1500–2800 ha−1 versus €125–300 ha−1). The performance of conventional mole drains and gravel mole drains was compared on a clay loam soil in the south of Ireland over 12 rainfall events. The installation dates of mole drainage treatments were staggered (January versus July) to assess how soil moisture status during installation affected performance. Treatments were (A) undrained control, (B) mole drainage installed in January 2011 (suboptimal), (C) mole drainage installed in July 2011 (optimal) and (D) gravel mole drainage installed in July 2011. Gravel mole drains were consistently more efficient in removing excess water than mole drains. Mean total drain flow (DF) during rainfall events was greater (P < .05, standard error 0.56 mm) in gravel mole drains (7.4 mm) than any mole drainage treatment irrespective of installation conditions (B [3.8 mm] and C [4.2 mm]). Initially, DF volumes exceeded overland flow (OF) in all treatments (Events 1–4, mean total OF was 0.47 [±0.08] of mean total DF). From Event 5 onwards, this relationship changed with OF being greater than DF (mean total OF was 2.02 [±0.41] of mean total DF). Results showed that across treatment replicates, the water table depth was consistently shallower in control plots. Mole drains were effective for a period of approximately 2 years. Although gravel mole drains were more effective, they were also subject to significant deterioration during the study. Installation conditions had no effect on mole drain performance. The results suggest that on this site conventional mole drainage repeated every 2 years could provide adequate drainage at low cost.",

    "abstract": "A substantial deficit of protein sources for livestock and expected changes in agro-climatic conditions are two challenges for European agriculture. Both can be addressed by introducing more autumn-sown legumes into Central European farming systems. Therefore, a three-year field experiment was conducted under Pannonian climate conditions in eastern Austria in which several winter faba bean varieties from different European countries were compared to a spring faba bean variety. Winter faba bean was susceptible to frost damage. Best overwintering was observed with the German variety Hiverna and the French variety Diva. Regarding overwintering, the first winter allowed for a clear differentiation between varieties, in the second winter, severe frost caused loss of almost all winter faba bean plants and in the third winter, which was mild, most varieties showed good overwintering. Grain yield of winter faba bean was mainly determined by variations of plants m−2 (i.e. by overwintering) whereas compensatory mechanisms between yield components had a minor influence on yield formation. No grain yield advantage could be observed for winter faba bean varieties compared to the spring faba bean variety even in the year with good overwintering. Regarding yield components, winter faba bean had generally more shoots plant−1 and a higher thousand kernel weight but spring faba bean tended to have more pods shoot−1 and grains shoot−1 whereas pods plant−1, grains plant−1 and grains pod−1 generally did not differ. In conclusion, limited winter hardiness together with the minor influence of compensatory mechanisms between yield components on yield formation are serious constraints for increasing the cultivation of winter faba bean in Central Europe.",

A total of 144 sweet potato genotypes were evaluated at 2 sites in Tanzania using a 12 × 12 simple lattice design. Data collected included 10 quantitative and 17 qualitative agro-morphological traits and virus reaction. Results indicated differences among genotypes for most traits studied. The mean DMC was 36% with clones Zapallo and Ukerewe exhibiting the lowest and highest values of 29% and 45%, respectively. The mean storage root yield of clones was 5.1 t/ha with genotype Jewel expressing the highest yield of 11.3 t/ha. Genotypes Resisto and Mataya were early flowering at 40 and 50 days, respectively, while Ex-Mwanza and Kandoro did not flower at all. Fifty-eight per cent of the genotypes showed resistant reaction to SPVD, while 31% and 11% were moderately susceptible and susceptible to the disease, respectively. A positive correlation was observed for the number of roots and fresh root yield. Seven clones including Simama, Ukerewe, Mataya, Resisto, 03–03, Ex-Msimbi-1 and Gairo were selected for high storage root yield and related traits or SPVD resistance. The selected genotypes are recommended as potential parents for sweet potato breeding.",

We aimed to study the potential of various leguminous species, other than the traditionally cultivated red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), as green manure pre-crops for subsequent cereals. The use of different legume species enables to exploit advantages of specific legumes in organic cereal production. In order to test the legumes as pre-crops for cereals, we carried out trials located in the temperate climate zone of northeast Europe (58°44′59.41″ N, 26°24′54.02″ E). We sowed the following perennial legumes as pre-crops: red clover, alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum L.) and Washington lupine (Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.), biennial white sweet clover (Melilotus albus Medik.) and annual Alexandria clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.). Timothy (Phleum pratense L.) was used as a control. The leguminous pre-crops were followed by three spring cereals (barley, oat and spring wheat) and two winter cereals (rye and winter wheat). We tested the first-year after-effect (all cereals) and second-year after-effect (only barley and oat) of pre-crops on the grain yield of cereals. Perennial and biennial legume species produced the highest dry matter yield and contained the highest amount of nutrients, especially nitrogen, compared to annual species. All subsequent cereals produced significant extra yields after each leguminous pre-crop in the following two years, although the effect was smaller in the second year. The most suitable pre-crops for spring cereals were red and alsike clover followed by lupine, whereas the best pre-crops for winter cereals were sweet clover and annual clovers. Our results show the potential of various leguminous pre-crop species as valuable sources of green manure in organic crop rotation.",

Correlation analysis of a 70-year (1946–2016) data series for flowering time of the cultivar 'Gravenstein' revealed a close relationship of the flowering phenophase with April–May heat accumulation (r = −0.98). Over the last 50-year period, flowering was advanced by 16 days in response to the temperature rises. Similarly, on average for 12 cultivars of varying earliness, flowering was advanced by 9 days over the latest 30-year period (1986–2016). Furthermore, the interrelationship between various phenological stages and floral morphogenesis of the same cultivars in the years 2013 and 2014 was studied, and related to flower-bud formation. The different stages of floral morphogenesis were identified, presented and used as a basis for assessment of flower-bud development in serial dissections. Floral initiation in spurs of actively growing trees took place in late July, approx. 8 weeks after full bloom, whereas in extension shoots, initiation took place after growth cessation in August, approximately 2 weeks later. Decreasing temperatures in mid-August coincided with the cessation of growth and floral initiation in extension shoots, suggesting that the processes may be causally related. The results show that, in the Nordic climate, the period between blooming and initiation of new floral primordia is considerably shorter than in warmer climates, suggesting that the period is only marginally long for completion of shoot growth, and hence, timely floral initiation. This may be an important reason for the irregular flowering and frequent incidences of alternate bearing in apple trees in the cool Nordic climate. The presented information can be useful for determination of the correct timing of flower and fruit thinning to counterbalance biennial bearing.",

Three successive rubber rotations at young and old ages were compared with the adjacent forest in Suratthani province, Thailand. Soil biodiversity quality index was calculated from a set of indicators which were combined into a single score to present a functional assessment of the gradient of disturbance. The results showed three negative effects on soil biodiversity (i) the biodiversity quality index immediately declined after deforestation (ii) the old age rubber plantations had a lower soil biodiversity as the nematodes were a main driver of diversity in the young plantation, and (iii) similarly, for the soil chemical properties, the long-term effect of rubber chronosequence evidenced deterioration in the third rotation. Therefore, two rotations of rubber plantation (around 50 years) seemed to be the maximum length of rubber monocropping in terms of soil biodiversity recovery.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp ciceris is one of the major diseases impacting chickpea productivity. Significant losses are reported by farmers due to the absence of effective wilt management options. Biological control using beneficial microorganisms in agriculture, is one of the promising alternatives and eco-friendly strategies utilised to overcome this disease. The present study investigated the biocontrol effect of 40 bacterial strains isolated from the rhizosphere of healthy chickpea plants collected from major chickpea growing regions in Morocco. Twelve out of 40 strains showed more than 25% in vitro inhibition of the pathogen growth. These strains, using the 16S rDNA gene sequencing, were classified into three genera, namely Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Pseudomonas, represented by different species. Our finding showed that the mode of antagonism was mainly due to the production of diffusible and volatile compounds as well as lytic enzymes. Moreover, a greenhouse experiment of the three selected antagonistic strains showed a significant reduction in the mean of wilt incidence in different chickpea genotypes,StrainB18 reduced the wilt incidence in the susceptible variety from 90% to 18% Consequently, our antagonistic bacterial strains could be a potential component of integrated management of Fusarium wilt, therefore, increase the yield of chickpea.",

Thus, the study aimed to assess the presence of soil microorganisms in lahar-laden soils in Sta. Rita, Pampanga, with their ability as beneficial microbes for crop production. Vigna radiata was used as the trap crop and grown for a maximum of 35 days in a microcosm experiment where all variables were similar except for the location of the sampling site. Through the sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, five representative isolates revealed close resemblance to the genus Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium, while the others were classified as non-rhizobial endophytes, namely, Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, and Leifsonia. These results indicate that the lahar-laden soils in the sampling site harbour some agronomically-important genera of microorganisms. Surprisingly, this is the first time that the species Leifsonia xyli was identified and isolated in acidic lahar-laden soil. In contrast, it is hypothesised that the presence of L.xyli in this study might be attributed to the acidic soil pH, leading to the suppression of rhizobia in root nodules.",

Organic amendment increased SOM, especially for FYM and BLD, while cover crop did not affect SOM. Yet, cover crop increased tuber yields in the second year, and reduced the severity of potato diseases by 10% in post-harvest potatoes in both years. In the second year, the number of marketable potatoes after storage increased by 37% with cover crop. Organic amendments did not affect potato yield or quality, but the proportion of marketable potatoes tended to be higher in the amended soil. By lab incubation, BLD showed the largest potential for SOM storage, up to 32 years, followed by FYM and SD. Cover crops and organic amendments is recommended in potato production, especially for early potatoes where there is sufficient time after harvest to establish a good cover crop.",

In this study, the effects of cotton (Cot), alfalfa (Alf), and rapeseed (Rap) cropping on the bacterial and fungal communities in saline soil were compared based on high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of the Cot, Alf, and Rap groups decreased significantly compared with those of bare land (CK). Especially, soil pH (8.3) and EC (0.93 mS cm-1) of the Alf group decreased the most, and the contents of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) increased the most, which increased by 250% and 91.4%, respectively compared with those of the CK (p < 0.05). Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla in the three groups, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal phyla. The diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities in the Alf group was higher than that in the Cot and Rap groups. The results of RDA and PERMANOVA analysis showed that soil pH, EC, C/N ratio, and TN were the main factors affecting soil bacterial and fungal communities in the three groups. In general, Cot, Alf, and Rap cropping all could reduce soil pH and EC and improve soil microbial community structure and diversity, but Alf cropping had the best effects in improving saline soil quality and bacterial and fungal diversity.",

In this paper, the results of one field trial series carried out at the Potato Research Institute, Lammi, Finland, during the years 1987–90 are reported. The main plots in a split-plot designed trial series consisted of three cropping systems: conventional, integrated and organic. The subplots included three cultivars differing especially in their late blight (Phythophtora infestans, (Mont.) de Bary) resistance: Bintje, Record and Matilda. Canopy measurements showed differences that can be attributed to different nitrogen supply in decreasing order from conventional to integrated to organic system. The trial sites were very heavily infested with potato scab, resulting in a very low percentage of I-class yield in susceptible cultivars Bintje and Matilda. Late blight was a serious problem in organically grown Bintje, as expected. Total yields in the integrated and organic systems were 10% and 36% lower, respectively, than in the conventional system. There was an interaction between cropping system and cultivar in favour of Bintje and the conventional system and Record in the organic system. The percentage of I-class yield was lowest in the conventional system. Some of the quality characteristics were slightly improved in the integrated and/or organic systems. Storage losses, caused mainly by tuber blight, were high in organically grown potatoes. There were no large differences in production costs between the cropping systems. The main determinants of the unit production cost of potatoes were total yield and yield of I-class potatoes. The average unit costs were 1.76 FIM kg−1 in the conventional, 1.68 FIM kg−1 in the integrated and 2.36 FIM kg−1 in the organic system. Record showed the lowest unit production costs in all systems −1.33, 1.37 and 1.80 FIM kg−1, respectively.",

The fertilizers were applied as three single doses of 30, 60 and 90 kg N ha−1 or split doses at two different growing stages, i.e. 30 + 30 kg N ha−1. No major differences between fertilizers were noticed. The main differences were found between experiments. Compared with the winter wheat, the spring wheat samples had a higher content of endosperm storage proteins, a lower content of detergent‐soluble proteins and a smaller diameter of large starch granules, and responded to increased N fertilizer applications by a significant increase in protein content and content of endosperm storage proteins. In the winter wheat samples, the starch content increased significantly and there was a tendency towards an increased volume proportion of large starch granules. In both experiments, bread yield was positively correlated to the content of endosperm storage proteins, total N content and proportion of short amylopectin unit chains, and negatively to acetic acid‐soluble proteins and the diameter of large starch granules.

Up to the harvest of barley, catch crops undersown in connection with the sowing of barley, when roots emerged from kernels, when the first leaf reached the top of the coleoptile and when the barley had three leaves fully developed, produced 588, 468, 250 and 50 kg above-ground biomass per ha, respectively, when 80 kg N ha−1 was applied.

The production of rye-grass was similar when 40 kg N ha−1 was applied, but that of the red clover was about twice as large. The influence of the catch crops on the grain yield of barley varied among experiments and no general differences depending on catch crop or time of undersowing could be determined. Biomass production in the autumn was only affected by the amount of catch crop at the harvest of barley if the stand was very sparse or very dense. Italian rye-grass, perennial rye-grass and red clover increased their biomass during autumn with 1138, 981 and 1239 kg ha−1, respectively.",

The MUNCH sample, with a high buffer capacity against acid, was found to be slow in heavy metal release. The high correlation coefficients for added H+ versus % of total metal released, however, reflect that under the influence of 'foreign' acids, this sample will also be capable of releasing heavy metals relatively easily. Liming was effective in rendering the heavy metals immobile. 90–100 tons of CaCO3 were found to be enough to immobilise most of the metals released from a shale waste to an acceptable level, assuming a shale waste density of 1–2 kg dm−3.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The interaction between calcium and phosphate is complex because these ions both support and counteract each other. The supporting effect is due to a simultaneous uptake and translocation of calcium and phosphate. The counteracting effect is caused by precipitation of less soluble calcium phosphates at the vicinity of nutrient-absorbing roots. At high activity ratios between potassium and calcium the risk of calcium deficiency is obvious. The capability of plants to absorb calcium ions is then increased by application of soluble phosphate fertilizers. In a field experiment, application of potassium chloride decreased the uptake of phosphorus and crop yield. Application of ammonium phosphate increased the content of water-soluble phosphate in a soil extract and the early uptake of phosphorus and calcium. Application of ordinary superphosphate had less effect than ammonium phosphate on the solubility of phosphate in the soil, whereas the calcium ion activity and crop yield increased considerably. Excess input of potassium is usual on farms with a high animal stocking rate and on vegetable farms where potash fertilizers have been used in excessive amounts for years. Decreased uptake and utilization of magnesium and calcium in plants cause quality problems for products. It is suggested to limit excessive fertilization of potassium and to control the balances between nutrients by testing the activity ratios in the soil extracts.

Italian rye grass sown after barley harvest gave 360 kg dry matter containing 8 kg N per ha. Spring sown rye grass reduced average soil nitrate by 7–8 kg N per ha in autumn and early winter. Autumn sown Italian rye grass reduced soil nitrate by 2 kg N per ha in early winter. In the following spring, the average effect of a rye grass catch crop was a reduction in soil nitrate of 4 kg N per ha. Spring sown perennial rye grass reduced average yield of the main barley crop by 149 kg and Italian rye grass by 442 kg grain per ha.

    "abstract": "Large applications of mineral fertilizers in Chinese cabbage [ Brassica pekinensis (Lour.) Rupr.] increased growth, total nitrogen and nitrate concentrations at harvest, and increased the occurrence of internal tipburn. Green mulch, as the only fertilizer or in combination with small amounts of mineral fertilizers, resulted in slower growth and lower total nitrogen and nitrate concentrations at harvest, and also prevented the occurrence of internal tipburn. No visible symptoms of nutrient deficiencies were detected, but plant analyses showed that the concentrations of magnesium, zinc, manganese and copper were below the estimated sufficiency limits in all fertilizer regimes. High soil pH, 6.4-6.8, and large amounts of calcium in the soil decreased the availability of these elements. The results demonstrate the importance of simultaneous analyses of several elements in revealing suboptimal concentrations and/or imbalances that depress yield and quality but do not result in visible symptoms. The results also indicate that organic fertilizers such as green mulch may be more suitable than mineral fertilizers in preventing the occurrence of physiological disorders such as tipburn.

In this study, the RUSLE, EPIC and WEPP models were used to estimate soil erosion from small grain production in south-central Chile, a region having a Mediterranean type climate and volcanic soils with distinctive properties compared to non-volcanic soils. The models were compared for their consistency with historical rates of erosion and those calculated using the previously calibrated USLE model. Of the models, WEPP permitted the most adequate parameterization for both climate and volcanic soil, and calculated erosion rates that were in overall agreement with field and USLE values.",

Among the treatments, foliar spray of GA3+TRIA significantly promoted the values of most of the physiological and biochemical parameters including the opium yield. The morphine content was also enhanced. The effects of GA3 and TRIA were similar when given individually, in general, while only TRIA induced branching in the plants. Another important finding of this experiment was that GA3+TRIA favoured the branching as well as the development of capsules at the same levels of height in all the branches. This influence will bring about a practical benefit by facilitating easier manual or mechanical lancing of the capsules, the collection of the latex and the harvesting of the opium poppies. Thus, we conclude that 10−6 M each of GA3 and TRIA given together may be used for maximizing the yield of opium and morphine.",

As a field experiment, lettuce was grown on soil amended with 0, 20, 40 and 80 t ha−1 of sewage sludge or manure. Humic acid was applied on sewage sludge amended plots as 250 kg ha−1. Addition of sewage sludge and manure increased lettuce yield, head circle, head height and leaf number and N, P, K and Mg levels to same extent. Leaf Cd concentration increased in sludge treated plots more than manure treated plots. Sewage sludge and manure applications increased organic matter, electrical conductivity, total N, available P, exchangeable K, total Cu, Ni and AB-DTPA (ammonium bicarbonate-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) extractable Mn, Cu and Cd concentrations of topsoil. Extractable Fe, Cr and Zn and total Cd, Cr and Zn increased in soil with added sludge. Soil pH was unaffected by either sludge or manure applications. Lettuce leaf concentrations of Cd from the plots treated with humic acid were lower than those not treated with humic acid. Sludge together with humic acid application significantly increased soil available P, and impeded the increase of the soil AB-DTPA extractable Zn concentration. It may be concluded that sewage sludge can be an alternative to manure to enrich organic matter, and rectify N, P, Fe and Zn deficiencies with high pH and calcareous soils. Also, humic substances can be used, to a limited extent, for controlling the availability of sludge-borne heavy metals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Temporal changes in the scores of selected soil fertility indices were studied over six years in three different cases of organic crop rotation located in southern, eastern and central Norway. The cropping history and the initial scores of fertility indices prior to conversion to organic cropping differed between the sites. Crop yields, regarded as an overall, integrating fertility indicator, were in all rotations highly variable with few consistent temporal trends following the first year after conversion. On the site in eastern Norway, where conversion followed several years of all-arable crop rotations, earthworm number and biomass and soil physical properties improved, whereas the system was apparently degrading with regard to P and K trade balances and contents in soil. On the other two sites, the picture was less clear. On the southern site, which had a relatively fertile soil before conversion, the contents of soil organic matter and K decreased during the six-year period, but the scores of other fertility indices showed no trends. On the site in central Norway, there were positive trends for earthworm-related indices such as worm biomass and tubular biopores, and negative trends for soil porosity. The results, especially those from the eastern site, illustrate the general difficulty in drawing conclusions about overall fertility or sustainability when partial indicators show divergent trends. Consequently, the study gave no unambiguous support to the initial working hypothesis that organic farming increases inherent overall soil fertility, but rather showed that the effect varied among indicators and depended on status of the cases at conversion. It is concluded that indicators are probably better used as tools to learn about and improve system components than as absolute measures of sustainability.",

Four different single row planting systems (vertical axis, free spindle, hedgerow and Y-trellis) and three planting densities (0.5, 1.0, 1.5×4 m for the Y-trellis and hedge trees and 2.0×4 m for the central leader trees) were evaluated. This field planting gave a rapid canopy development and crop yields at early tree age. Trunk cross sectional area of the trees increased with increasing tree spacing. 'Opal' was the most vigorous cultivar. During the first four cropping years, the yields/ha were positively correlated with tree density. After nine years, cumulative yield per ha was highest on the Y-trellis and hedge trees with the highest density (5000 trees per ha). The two central leaders showed similar yield pattern, but yielded less than the two other systems. Plums produced on these canopy systems showed minor differences in the average fruit weights, and no significant differences were found among the spacings. The soluble solid contents of the plums were in general high. Neither planting density nor system had much impact on the sugar content of these cultivars. 'Opal' had significantly smaller plums and lower contents of soluble solids than the two other cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to an increased demand for excluding external nitrogen fertilization there is a need for cultivation measures which optimize use of legume nitrogen fixation. We have, during field conditions in central Sweden, evaluated the contribution of intercropped peas (Pisum sativum L.) and oats (Avena sativa L.) to the overall N economy. We have done this by determining the N2 fixation by the difference method and by the 15N-dilution method using two reference crops. N2 fixing efficiency was calculated as fixed nitrogen of total pea nitrogen and of dry matter, respectively. We complemented this by determining the mineral nitrogen at three soil levels before and after the growing seasons. Our results indicate that nitrogen yield sometimes, but not dry matter yield, was affected by pea ratio. The efficiency of the fixation increased with decreasing pea ratio. This could be explained by competition for N from the intercropped oats, in which the N-concentration decreased with decreasing pea ratio. Results indicate that peas supplied the intercropped oats with nitrogen. Residual soil mineral nitrogen after harvest was similar in the intercrop to the pure stand of oats, while it was higher in a pure stand of peas. This was repeated in one out of three trials following the winter season. The nitrate to total mineral N ratio was higher in the pure stand of peas and lower in the intercrop and the pure oats. The studied crops did not give different residual effects in nitrogen and dry matter contents in a following oat crop. Conclusions are that intercropping may increase the efficiency of fixation and reduce risk of N leaching, but this is not necessarily reflected in current yields or subsequent crops.",

At the same time, pre-sprouting is a very time- and energy-consuming procedure. We investigated if thermal treatment could replace pre-sprouting and how it affects the growth and development of potato haulms and tubers. For that purpose an experiment was conducted in 2000–2002 to examine the opportunities for growing potatoes by using different methods of pre-planting treatment of seed tubers. Early, middle and late maturing potato varieties (two Estonian varieties and one Latvian) were used, each being subdivided into three variant categories: untreated, thermal shock and pre-sprouting. The experiment indicated that one or the other of thermal shock or pre-sprouting shortened the time to emergence by up to 10 days. With pre-sprouting, the formation of tubers started as soon as 45 days after planting and with thermal shock 50 days after planting, i.e., 5–10 days earlier than in the untreated variant. Thermal shock of seed tubers had the greatest effect on the number of tubers per plant, while pre-sprouting increased the average weight of tubers. Both pre-sprouting and thermal shock had a strong effect on the weight of the haulms in varieties with a longer growth period.",

The N-fertilization effects on growth, yield, and herbage quality were therefore examined on three farms over a period of three years. Nitrogen was applied at four rates (0, 75, 150, and 225 kg N year−1) with cutting or grazing regime in Year 1 and Year 2, after establishment. A spring-only application of 150 kg N was compared with four applications during the season, which was the fertilization management in the rest of the experiment. N-response was greatly affected by management. Under cutting it was higher in Year 1 [16 kg dry matter (DM) kg−1 N] than in Year 2 (9 and 13 kg DM kg−1 N with and without residual effects of fertilization in Year 1). Under grazing with one or two rest periods for cuts the N-response was only approximately half that under cutting. Under grazing there was only a response at the beginning of the season (May–June), while under cutting there was a response throughout the season. N-response decreased with increasing clover content in herbage by 4 kg DM kg−1 N per 10%-units of clover content. A spring-only application of 150 N increased the growth rate in spring–early summer, and decreased the rate later in the season. The annual yield was unaffected by the application method in fields with good clover establishment, but the seasonal clover content was highly affected. The results indicate different possibilities for strategic fertilization both at farm and field level, and in swards with a high clover content it demonstrates how the clover content can be used as a buffer both for maximizing the N-response and for manipulating the production profile.",

In a preliminary experiment in this work, the effect of different NaCl concentrations was studied on the growth of six cultivars of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) in hydroponic medium. After selection of two contrasting cultivars, growth, sodium accumulation and distribution among leaf fractions as well as the functional significance of the antioxidant defence system under mild (50 mM) and severe salinity (200 mM) were investigated. NaCl treatment exerted either a stimulatory or an inhibitory effect on shoot growth, depending on concentration and cultivar. Higher growth improvement under mild salinity was observed in cultivar IC simultaneous with higher tolerance to severe saline treatment. Although two tested cultivars did not differ in Na concentration of leaves, its distribution among leaf fractions (apoplasmic fluid, cell wall, and cell sap) responded differentially to salinity treatment. Under mild salinity, proportional Na in cell sap of cultivar IC was greater than that of cultivar 7233, leading to greater replacement of K by Na in the former cultivar. In leaves of 7233, in contrast, proline was the major osmoticum. Activity of H2O2-scavenging enzymes (APX, CAT, and POD) was induced by salinity, keeping H2O2 concentration low under mild but not severe salinity. Shoot and root concentration of superoxide radicals was related to differential response of cultivars to salinity, i.e. IC was much more protected against superoxide radicals because of higher SOD activity than was 7233. Activity of nitrate reductase was reduced by both salinity levels and caused reduction of total free amino acids and protein concentrations. Results suggested that the main cause of cultivar difference is higher replacement of K by Na and allocation of more Na to the symplasm under mild salinity, and an indigenously higher protection against superoxide radicals under severe salinity.",

The spring barley field had a total of 41.7–62.4 kg N ha−1 and 1.75–2.81 Mg C ha−1 added to the soil with straw, weed, and roots, depending on the level of fertilisation; with red clover, and both common and hybrid lucerne undersowing, with barley straw and roots, the values were 3.45–3.96 Mg C ha−1 and 139.9–184.9 kg N ha−1.

    "abstract": "Abstract Long-term vegetation restoration carried out on the slopes of the Loess Plateau of China employed different spatial and temporal land-use patterns but very little is known about the effects of these patterns on soil water-content variability. For this study the small Donggou catchment was selected to investigate soil water-content distributions for three spatial scales, including the entire catchment area, sampling transects, and land-use systems. Gravimetric soil water contents were determined incrementally to a soil depth of 1.20 m, on 10 occasions from April to October, 2007, at approximately 20-day intervals. Results indicated that soil water contents were affected by the six land-use types, resulting in four distinct patterns of vertical distribution of soil moisture (uniform, increasing, decreasing, and fluctuating with soil depth). The soil water content and its variation were also influenced in a complex manner by five land-use patterns distributed along transects following the gradients of five similar slopes. These patterns with contrasting hydrological responses in different components, such as forage land (alfalfa)–cropland–shrubland or shrubland–grassland (bunge needlegrass)–cropland–grassland, showed the highest soil water-content variability. Soil water at the catchment scale exhibited a moderate variability for each measurement date, and the variability of soil water content decreased exponentially with increasing soil water content. The minimum sample size for accurate data for use in a hydrological model for the catchment, for example, required many more samples for drier (69) than for wet (10) conditions. To enhance erosion and runoff control, this study suggested two strategies for land management: (i) to create a mosaic pattern by land-use arrangement that located units with higher infiltration capacities downslope from those with lower soil infiltrabilities; and (ii) raising the soil-infiltration capacity of units within the spatial mosaic pattern where possible.",

Field experiments were carried out on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) in eight farmer fields. Four fields of Missa soil series (Typic Ustochrept) and four of Rajar soil series (Typic Ustorthent) were selected. Treatments in each field were: farmers' practice as control without soil-water conservation, and with farmers' rate of fertilizer (per hectare 40 kg N + 30 kg P2O5); improved fertilization (per hectare 100 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, 2 kg Zn, and 1 kg B) without soil-water-conservation practices; soil-water-conservation practices (deep plowing, bund improvement, ploughing across the contour) + farmers' rate of fertilizers; and soil-water conservation + improved fertilization.

The lowest yields were recorded under farmers' practice for both crops. Similar was the response for water-use efficiency and plant uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, zinc, and boron. Missa soil series was more responsive than was Rajar to integrated soil-management practices. Synergistic application of soil-water conservation and improved fertilization practices significantly improved the crop yields, nutrient uptake, and water-use efficiency.",

Genotypes of lentil were: Masoor-93, Markaz-2001, and NARC-02/2. Masoor-93 showed the highest seed yield, crop-growth rate, net assimilation rate, and seed protein contents among all the tested cultivars. P applied at the highest rate (80 kg ha−1) caused the best positive response with respect to physiological traits, growth attributes, and yield components. Furthermore, the application of P-fertilizer was found to be feasible in economic terms, as the net return, value-to-cost ratio, and relative increase in income were enhanced successively at higher phosphorus rates. It was concluded that for maximum potential yield of lentil, genotype Masoor-93 is the best suited under rain-fed conditions provided that its P nutrition is enhanced. The pronounced genetic variability in lentil-yield traits suggests that nutrient-efficient germplasm can be screened through breeding programmes to promote lentil production.",

In the study period (1973–2005), crop production was dominated by spring barley, winter wheat, rape and, in later years, potatoes. Winter crops were cultivated 60% of the time. Leaching of total nitrogen (TotN) and total phosphorus (TotP) to drain water was low, on average 10 kg ha−1 year−1 for TotN and 0.07 kg ha−1 year−1 for TotP based on measurements. Nitrogen fertilisation increased slightly from 121 to 142 kg ha−1 year−1 during the period in a balanced way in line with increasing crop yields of cereals, from 5.8 to 6.6 tonnes year−1. For the entire study period, the temperature was estimated to increase significantly by a total of +2 °C for the growing season (April–September). Precipitation (+16 mm) and humidity (+11%) were also estimated to have increased significantly, mainly in June. Simulations with a deterministic and coupled N-leaching database model (SOILN-DB) indicated an increased rate of mineralisation (+2 kg ha−1 year−1) and increased N leaching to the drain pipes (+0.06 kg ha year−1) as a result of climate changes. In this simulation spring tillage instead of autumn tillage was estimated to reduce N leaching by 10%. Mineral P fertilisers were applied to winter crops in autumn until 1999, but thereafter all mineral P fertilisers were applied in spring by drilling in bands. A weak trend for decreasing concentration of dissolved reactive phosphorus was indicated based on the measurements in the tile drain outlet.",

The percent germination of the seeds was monitored for 7 days. The activities of catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation, H2O2 levels, and phenolic matter content were tested on 0, 1st, 3rd, and 7th days of germination. On the 7th day of germination, the germination ratios of the old T. repens and T. pratense seeds were 32 and 17%, while freshly harvested seeds showed 99 and 96% germination on the 4th day, respectively. The long-term aging caused an important increase in lipid peroxidation levels of the old dry seeds. Total phenolic content was high in the old dry seeds of T. repens compared with those of T. pratense. Remarkably, the long-term aging caused an important decrease in H2O2 content and the activities of catalase and peroxidase enzymes, but an increase in activity of superoxide dismutase in both the old dry seeds. The decreases in germinability of the old legume seeds were well correlated with the increasing level of lipid peroxidation and the decreasing activities of peroxidase and catalase. During the germination of the legume seeds, a noticeable increase was determined only in peroxidase activity in two types of the old seeds, while catalase activity decreased. However, the other biochemical parameters studied did not significantly change between the germinating old seeds and their freshly harvested controls.",

RUE and UPE were derived for shoot growth and N uptake by calibrating a mechanistic model to above-ground biomass and N observations in an outdoor box experiment, conducted during two years at two soil nitrogen levels in Central Sweden. The model, which is driven by climate variables, predicts above-ground biomass and nitrogen increment as a function of intercepted radiation, temperature, and nitrogen availability. Observed values of leaf area and root development are used as input. Shoot RUE in S. arvensis was only 56% of the RUE in spring barley (1.35 and 2.40 g dry weight MJ−1, respectively). On the other hand, shoot UPE in S. arvensis at low N supply during early season was seven times higher than in barley (0.07 and 0.01 d−1, respectively). For S. arvensis, UPE was higher at the low soil nitrogen level than at high level, while the reverse was found for barley, at a given amount of biomass per area unit. We suggest that the higher shoot UPE in S. arvensis at low nitrogen supply, in comparison with the low UPE of annual small grain crops at low soil nitrogen levels, is a contributing cause for the observed increase in S. arvensis in organic farming.",

The baking characteristics of grain are strongly related to the quantity of monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenins. Their accumulation and proportions impact the viscosity, porosity, and degree of rising in baking. These properties determine the applications of wheat in the baking industry. The changes in protein composition are mainly influenced by the genotype, the environment, and the interactions between the genotype and the environment and fertilization. The presented results of the studies refer to the impact of fertilization using waste products (meat bone meals, MBMs) originating from the recycling industry, in comparison to organic and mineral fertilizers, on the technological quality of spring and winter wheat based on the proportion of gluten proteins. The content of gluten proteins, particularly high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight glutenins, in the protein of the examined spring and winter wheat cultivars increased with manure and bone meat meal fertilization, both with and without the addition of effective microorganisms. The grain of the Tybalt spring wheat cultivar had a low content of the harmful α/β-gliadin subunits in relation to the examined wheat cultivars under the influence of fertilization. Fertilization with compost generated a beneficial ratio of the most desired HMW glutenins to the total content of gluten proteins in spring wheat. The evaluated fertilizers (MBM, organic fertilizers) and the addition of microbiological preparations to MBM have good fertilizing properties by making the soil nutrients available to plants.",

Many studies have focused only on a few species. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of treatment and sampling date on soil pH, abundance of total number of bacteria, molds, yeasts, mesophilic spore-forming bacteria, Fusarium spp., actinomycetes, azotobacteria, cellulose decomposers, denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria in organically (ORGGRM – green manure, and ORGFYM – green manure, solid cattle manure) and conventionally (CONFYM – solid cattle manure + mineral fertilizer and pesticides) cultivated soil. Fertilization with manure had positive direct- and after-effect (p<0.05) on the total number of bacteria, mesophilic spore-forming bacteria, nitrifying bacteria and cellulose decomposers, even in the CONFYM treatment. The abundance of yeasts was higher (p<0.05) in ORGFYM treatment (3.35×103) and 34–48% lower in CONFYM and ORGGRM treatments. The abundance of molds, Fusarium spp., and actinomycetes during the study in different treatments was similar but their abundance was significantly higher (p<0.05) when the weather in the sampling time was warm and humid. The negative impact of pesticides in CONFYM treatment occurred on the total number of bacteria, yeasts, molds, and denitrifying bacteria. The yeasts were most sensitive to pesticides; in study years, when the use of pesticides was very intensive, their abundance in CONFYM treatment decreased 72% compared with the ORGFYM treatment. The 4-year test results showed that although green manuring is considered an important management practice in organic cultivation, to maintain and increase the abundance of microbes in different microbial communities it is important to use other organic fertilizers such as animal manure in addition to green manure.",

Research has shown that phenolic compounds isolated from certain plants influence N cycling in soils, which results in a decrease of N losses and represents a key issue for environmental protection worldwide. In this study, water-soluble and ethanol-soluble compounds were extracted from the leaves, bark and roots of certain tree and shrub species in the Mediterranean zone of Chile, with the aim of measuring their effects on N transformation, soil respiration, soil microbial biomass and urease activity. The studied species were Acacia caven Mol, Quillaja saponaria Mol., Bacharis linearis (Ruiz & Pav.) Pers. and Pinus radiata D. Don. Plant extracts were applied to soil (Haploxeralf) fertilized with urea. The extracts obtained from the roots of A. caven in water, bark of A. caven in ethanol, bark of P. radiata in ethanol, leaves of P. radiata in water and roots of B. linearis in water showed a reduction in the soil nitrification rate. The bark of A. caven in ethanol and bark of P. radiata in ethanol extracts showed a reduction in urease activity. In conclusion, only the bark of P. radiata in ethanol extract affected all the biological parameters considered, reducing soil nitrification, urease activity, microbial biomass and carbon dioxide emissions from the soil, these being attributed to high levels of phenolic content in the extract. However, further research is necessary to explain the mechanisms involved.",

Responses of radiation interception and leaf photosynthesis after anthesis, dry matter accumulation and assimilates remobilization, nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield to fraction of topdressed nitrogen treatments were investigated in malting barley. Net photosynthetic rate of the penultimate leaf, leaf area index and light extinction coefficient increased with increasing fraction topdressed nitrogen from 0% to 30%, and then decreased from 30% to 50%. The putative gross maximum canopy photosynthesis was the highest for fraction of topdressed nitrogen of 30%, which was concomitant with the highest amount of post-anthesis accumulated assimilates. The remobilization of pre-anthesis stored assimilates from vegetative organs into grains was hardly significantly affected by fractions of topdressed nitrogen. Grain yield was the highest for fraction of topdressed nitrogen of 30%, which coincided with the highest plant nitrogen uptake and physiological and agronomic nitrogen use efficiencies. The enhanced nitrogen use efficiency was corresponding to the improved photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency in the leaves at fraction of topdressed nitrogen of 30%. In conclusion, appropriate fraction of topdressed nitrogen application on malting barley improved assimilation rate and nitrogen use efficiency resulting in higher grain yields and proper grain protein content in malting barley.",

    "abstract": "Soil compaction has increased during recent years due to the traffic with increasingly heavier machinery. We evaluated the effect of soil compaction on soil penetration resistance, rooting depth, light interception, radiation-use efficiency (RUE) and yield of three different cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). On loamy sand two compaction treatments (PAC-1 and PAC-2) and a no compaction reference treatment (REF) were applied. PAC-1 was intended to affect primarily the subsoil whereas PAC-2 was intended to affect primarily the topsoil. PAC-2 showed the highest and REF the lowest penetration resistance in the topsoil, respectively. In the subsoil both compaction treatments showed higher penetration resistances than REF. In comparison with REF, the compaction treatments decreased the estimated effective rooting depth by ca. 10, 20 and 50 cm in the three winter wheat cultivars tested, equivalent to decreases in the available soil water in the root zone of up to ca. 90 mm. These differences indicate some genetic variation in the ability of cultivars to penetrate compacted soil, although the interaction between compaction treatment and cultivar was not significant. Due to almost sufficient precipitation, the impairment of root penetration resulted in a minor yield decrease of ca. 9% of grain yield in PAC-2 and ca. 8% of total dry matter (DM) in both compaction treatments. The latter was attributed to decreases in interception of light and to efficiency of light energy conversion into biomass. The RUE was positively correlated with an estimated effective rooting depth across cultivars, while DM yield was not. This correlation probably was a result of restrictions on stomatal opening mediated by drought stress and abscisic acid produced in the root system in response to occasional soil drying. Root-sourced signals, triggered in a direct response to soil compaction, may have contributed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Winter turnip rape (Brassica rapa spp. oleifera) is an underutilized crop that deserves to be revitalized for use in high-latitude agriculture. Many crop rotations around the world are dependent on the small-grain cereals, and turnip rape as a break crop, with its range of secondary chemicals, helps to suppress weeds, nematodes and pathogenic fungi. It may be used as an energy crop, it can restrict erosion and nutrient leaching while also improving soil structure and fertility, and it requires relatively low inputs. Although winter turnip rape was once the major oil crop in Finland, in the 1970s it was replaced by spring turnip rape, the lower erucic acid and glucosinolate contents of which made it suitable for food and feed uses. Winter hardiness of the crop could be improved, and industrial end uses, such as lubricants for which high erucic acid content is preferred, targeted in the first instance. Breeding progress would be accelerated by a change from the predominantly self-incompatible breeding system to self-compatibility, now available in modern germplasm, and this would allow use of other rapid breeding methods, such as doubled haploidy. Thus, the many advantages of the winter turnip rape crop would repay its return to agriculture. In this review we will introduce the many utilization possibilities of the crop as well as give background on why more attention and research efforts should be paid towards this crop. We will also indicate some of the array of factors that have a marked role in an attempt to ecologically intensify crop production.",

Cadmium, one of the heavy metals, is water soluble and can be transferred from soil to plants and enter into the food chain. It is detrimental to human health because it accumulates in the body and can cause renal tubular dysfunction, pulmonary emphysema and osteoporosis. This heavy metal needs to be cleaned up for a clean and safe environment. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential of Dyera costulata as a phytoremediator to absorb cadmium from contaminated soils. Dyera costulata seedlings were planted on six different growth media (soil + different levels of cadmium): Control, 25 ppm Cd, 50 ppm Cd, 75 ppm Cd, 100 ppm Cd and 150 ppm Cd. The highest growth performance mainly height, basal diameter and number of leaves were in the control, 50 ppm Cd and 25 ppm Cd treatments, respectively. The highest accumulation of cadmium (52.9 ppm) was in the 75 ppm Cd treatment. Among the plant parts, leaves showed the highest concentration of cadmium. Dyera costulata showed high translocation factor and low bioconcentration factor values in soil at high cadmium concentrations and was also able to tolerate and accumulate high concentrations of cadmium. The roots of Dyera costulata were found to be suitable for the absorption of cadmium in contaminated soils. This species can be an efficient phytoremediator for soils contaminated with cadmium.",

Grasses in mixture with legumes had however higher N, Ca, S, Zn, Cu and tended to have higher Mg concentration, both in stems and leaves, while Mn were less concentrated in mixtures' dry matter. Further, the mixtures doubled their dry matter accumulation in the two weeks just around grass heading. The systems partly buffered the time-wise differences in the sense that the P accumulation paralleled dry matter but the N was diluted. This was mirrored in a decrease in N concentration and maintenance of the concentration level of P and other elements. As the stem–leaf ratio was higher (p<0.05) in festulolium than in ryegrass and as the stems of festulolium have lower concentrations of N, K, Ca, S, Mg, Fe and Cu than leaves, the mixtures including festulolium had a rapidly declining proportion of these elements in the combined mixtures' dry matter. Management options in improving the mineral supplies are thus to choose species when establishing the temporary grasslands according to functionality, to manipulate the content of legumes by the N supply level, and to time the harvest of the herbage.",

Cabernet Sauvignon from the vineyard located in Ilok, the eastern continental region of Croatia. Two different treatments of leaf removal (LR) were performed: removal of 3 leafs (T1) and 6 leafs (T2) before blooming, together with control (no leaf removal) (T3) during two years (2013 and 2014). Crop yield and average cluster weights per vine were determined. Density, pH and titratable acidity were measured in must, while the total phenols, total anthocyanins and antioxidant activity were measured in the extract of grape skin and produced wine. The analysis of individual anthocyanins in wine was performed by HPLC method. T2 treatment significantly lowered the crop yield and the average cluster weights, and increased total phenols, total anthocyanins, antioxidant activity and most abundant individual anthocyanins in wine. Defoliation did not affect the other chemical parameters in must, grape skin extract and wine. Vintage year is statistically the most significant source of variability for density of must, antioxidant activity in grape skin extract, as well as pH and titratable acidity in wine. This study has showed that the early leaf removal treatment in eastern continental part of Croatia could be used for the production of smaller quantity of high quality Cabernet Sauvignon red wine abundant with anthocyanins.",

The management systems were: (a) conventional, with the application of fertilizers and pesticides adjusted to target 5 t ha−1 grain yield; and (b) low-input, without fertilizers and pesticides. Biomass and nitrogen concentration, leaf area index, soil moisture, drainage water runoff and ground water table were measured periodically during the growing season.Results: In all three experimental years, the annual precipitation was close or above the climate normal, but a large part of the rainfall (up to 310 mm) was lost through drainage contributing to the occurrence of temporary moisture deficit in late spring or summer. Water stress resulted in a lower spring barley biomass accumulation rate and lower biomass yield in the years characterized by sub-optimal rainfall distribution. Direct measurements of water retention in the soil and DSSAT model simulations gave relatively good indication of water stress occurrence. Under the low-input management, nitrogen nutrition level was a major constraint for spring barley biomass and grain yield formation.Conclusions: Under Central Lithuania's conditions, spring barley frequently experiences temporary water stress, because a relatively high proportion of annual precipitation is lost during the non-growing period. This crop can benefit from anticipated increased precipitation and carbon dioxide levels if adequately provided with nitrogen.",

In this study, the effect of fire frequency on selected physical properties was studied in a long-term burning experiment. Treatments included: no burn (control), sexennial, quadrennial, triennial, biennial and annual burns. A line intercept sampling technique was used to collect disturbed and undisturbed soil samples from the surface for analysis. Frequent burning significantly increased the aggregate stability and bulk density when compared to less frequent burning. Frequent burning resulted in lower hydraulic conductivities and water conducting macroporosity when compared to intermediate burning frequencies, likely due to lower organic carbon contents associated with frequent burning. Soil water repellency was the highest in quadrennial burned plots. The results indicate that frequent burning can have a detrimental impact on soil physical properties, but small variations in inherent soil properties (texture) have a more dominant effect on the physical properties than fire frequency management. The results emphasize the complexity related the effect of fire on soil properties and future work should include all environmental factors in order to derive sustainable burning frequencies for this site.",

But soil erosion on slope farmland is also affected by many other factors, such as topography and rainfall. In order to explore the effect of crop growth on soil erosion on different slope gradient of slope farmland, and analyze the interaction of crop growth and slope gradient on soil erosion, this study used artificial simulated rainfall to observe the runoff rates and soil loss amounts under different slope gradients for maize, soybeans, and winter wheat in different growth stages. Results showed that crops and slope gradient both significantly affected production and development of slope runoff. Compared with bare land, mean runoff rate on slopes was reduced by 24%, 32%, and 94% respectively, and sediment yield was decreased by 44%, 55%, and 99% respectively on maize, soybean, and winter wheat fields. Inhibitory effects of crops on slope runoff rate and sediment yield were enhanced with crop growth and decreased with increasing slope gradient. Crop growth and coverage could offset the impact of increasing slope gradient on runoff and sediment to some extent and reduced water and soil loss on slopes. Sediment yield was produced largely when the slope gradient was greater than 10 degrees on maize and soybean fields, but soil erosion was effectively inhibited when the slope gradient was less than 15 degrees on winter wheat fields. Crop planting can effectively reduce the impact of slope gradient on soil erosion, especially during the flourishing period of crop growth.",

    "abstract": "Mexican poppy (Argemone mexicana) is a widespread noxious annual weed associated with crops such as corn (Zea mays L.), and this weed is persistent because it produces a seed bank. This invasive weed species must be controlled even in the dry season because Mexican poppy has a deep-reaching root system, which taps water from deep soil layers. Cases of a human death caused by Mexican poppy seeds in South Africa, India, and other Eastern countries were reported from the early years of the twentieth century. However, when weeds are controlled uniformly instead of site-specific or precision farming method across the spatially variable fields, there are environmental pollution challenges. Site-specific weed control techniques have gained interest in the precision farming community over the last years mainly because of Global Positioning System (GPS) applications, and a controlled measure of herbicides are applied where there are weeds in the field, and areas with more clusters of weeds receive the correct amount of herbicide application. Mexican poppy has prickles and is a nuisance to farmers, and herbicides represent a severe health hazard to humans due to chemical concentrations in water. For that reason, we propose the design of a site-specific weed control plan to use a row-guided robot to detect and identify weeds with accuracy, control speed timeously, and spray herbicides with a high level of precision and automation. These robotics methods are reported to be environmentally conscious, and economically efficient with less labour and management. The proposed method of deep learning neural networks, which use row-guided robots, a machine is trained on multiple images to identify weeds automatically from the main crop, and release a controlled measure of herbicides based on weed location and density, and spray weeds on-the-go upon emergence.",

This study explains the impact of acidified slurry on soil and crop in a leaching trial. Pot experiments with ryegrass and cereal crops were used with 15 and 45 m3 ha−1 acidified slurry application. The effect of acidified slurry on ryegrass and maize yield was positive, increasing the yield by 40% and 20%, respectively, compared to unacidified slurry. There was a significant effect of acidified slurry on soil pH when large amount of acidified slurry (45 m3 ha−1) was used. Soil pH decreased by 0.1 units. The smaller amount of acidified slurry (15 m3 ha−1) had non-significant effect. Thus, for environmental protection purposes, it is necessary to ensure that the nutrient amounts applied with slurry, in particular easily soluble nitrogen and sulphur, correspond to the needs of the plants. Particular attention must be paid to Ca-poor soils. Sulphate ions are physically negatively absorbed in the soil, facilitating their availability in and leaching from the soil. With sulphate anions, an equivalent amount of Ca and Mg cations is always leached from the soil.",

    "abstract": "There have been few long-term field studies on greenhouse gases measurement in organic crop rotations under temperate climatic conditions. Little is known about the extent to which the share of legumes in a crop rotation of organic farming affects the potentials for CO2 emission and soil organic carbon sequestration. The current study was aimed to investigate soil physicochemical state and soil net CO2 exchange rate in diverse organic crop rotations with different crop species and proportions of legumes. Four 5-year duration crop rotations were investigated. The best soil sustainability of the arable layer was found in a crop rotation enriched with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.). This rotation resulted in the highest soil mesoporosity and the lowest microporosity, ensured the best supply of plant-available water and revealed high soil resistance to dry conditions. Red clover secured the highest soil organic C sequestration, caused the increase in reserves of total N and available K, and slackened the decrease of soil-available P sources. Red clover-based cropping system exhibited the highest soil net CO2 exchange rate during five experimental years. The effect of crop rotation, consisting of phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.), peas (Pisum sativum L.) and yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.), on soil sustainability was weaker than the effect of rotation with red clover. Non-legume rotations, i.e. binary (two-crop) rotation and the crop rotation involving four spring and one winter species, can be regarded as miners of soil nutrient resources rather than contributors. These rotations did not promote soil sustainability because the soil lost large amounts of macronutrients and caused 26–33% lower soil net CO2 exchange rate, compared with leguminous rotations. For future, it could be recommended for ecological farming to rely more on crop rotations with red clover to improve ecosystems functioning.",

Six concentrations of methanol extract (3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 g L−1) were compared with the control (distilled water). The rate of seed germination and the radicle and hypocotyl length of 7-day-old test plant seedlings were reduced as the concentration of extracts increased compared to the control. Generally, the degree of toxicity of extracts derived from the leaves was more than the extracts derived from the stem. Cluster analysis and the concentrations required for 50% inhibition (defined as EC50) of all parameters showed that radicle growth was more suppressed than germination and hypocotyl growth. Lettuce and carrot were observed as the most sensitive plants while rice showed the highest tolerance to both extracts. Moreover, the dicot target plants were affected more severely than the monocots when treated with leaf extract. The chemical composition of the T. tuberculata methanolic extracts was analyzed by a GC–MS system. A total of 92 and 22 constituents (not previously identified) were found in the leaves and stem, respectively. The results showed that 17 of the 92 components in the leaves, as compared to 4 of 22 compounds in the stem, are known as toxic compounds. These results suggest that T. tuberculata contains a significant source of plant growth inhibitors with potential for the development of future natural herbicide.",

A greenhouse-pot experiment was conducted to investigate the salt tolerance of the Blackwell, Cave-in-rock and Sunburst cultivars, using the dominant native grass Leymus chinensis as a reference. All three switchgrasses yielded a greater aboveground biomass per plant than Leymus under low-salt conditions (≤2 g NaCl kg−1). However, their biomass production declined significantly at higher salt concentrations. The most salt-tolerant cultivar with respect to biomass production was Cave-in-rock, followed by Blackwell and Sunburst. Among the biomass fuel characteristic studied, ash composition was more significantly affected by salt stress than calorific values. High salt concentrations in the soil increased the content of Ca, Cl and Na in the biomass ash but reduced that of K. The impact of salt stress on ash transformation during combustion was estimated by considering three molar ratios of mineral elements. Growth in high-salt soils reduced the slagging tendency of the fuel, as indicated by the K/(Ca + Mg) ratio. The added Na is unlikely to cause eutectic formation during switchgrass combustion because the Na/(K + Na) ratio was generally below 0.2. However, the addition of NaCl increased the risk of forming chlorine-rich deposits (probably from the fly ash), as indicated by the Cl/(K + Na) ratio.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Demand for locally produced food products has increased in Finland in the past few years. It has brought new opportunities for food market actors from primary production to retail selling to invest in increasing their capacity and to promote local food in the market. This paper scrutinises local food in two ways, firstly, consumer preferences on purchasing local food and, secondly as comparison, producers' willingness to invest in the growth of local food production and their obstacles in doing so. The data used were obtained from three separate surveys. According to the survey results, consumers would prefer to buy products directly from farmers or via small distributors rather than from large-chain stores. In addition, the communication of farm enterprises themselves is seen more reliable than the communication by the food industry or retail. The entrepreneurs saw lack of time to develop the business as their biggest obstacle for growth. Still, they seem to be cautious about employing more workforces which could help in the operative everyday work and, thus, set the entrepreneur free to focus on the strategic issues of developing the business. Just a few stated that they consider themselves growth-oriented enterprises. They emphasised distinct growth opportunities, such as new confirmed market channels, as a requirement before considering expanding the business. Also, especially dairy and meat processing enterprises found the legislative requirements ambiguous. From the consumers' point of view, however, these results lead to believe that there is a substantial growth to be gained from locality for local primary producers and small-scale local food refiners. Furthermore, the consumers' trust towards the communication of farms has room for improvement and especially the communication of farm enterprises themselves should be given more emphasis.",

The aim of this study was to learn more about the use of saline irrigation water in drip-irrigated cotton. Therefore, a 5-year field experiment consisted of a 3 × 2 factorial complete randomized block design with three levels of irrigation water salinity (0.35, 4.61, and 8.04 dS m−1) and two N application rates (240 and 360 kg N ha−1) was carried out in arid regions of northwestern China. The results indicated that drip irrigation with SW (4.61 or 8.04 dS m−1) increased average soil water content and average soil salinity in the 0–100 cm depth. SW irrigation increased leachate –N concentrations. Nitrogen rate significantly affected leachate volume and salt concentration in some years; however, the trends were inconsistent. The treatment with 8.04 dS m−1 irrigation water significantly reduced cotton growth, yield, and N uptake in all the five cropping seasons. In contrast, the treatment with 4.61 dS m−1 water increased cotton growth, yield, and N uptake in the first year, but in the third, fourth, and fifth years, cotton growth, yield, and N uptake were significantly lower in the treatment with 4.61 dS m−1 water than in the treatment with 0.35 dS m−1 water. Cotton growth and yield increased as N application rate increased; however interactive effects between water salinity and N rate on cotton growth and yield were generally not significant. We conclude that drip irrigation with SW (EC>4.6 Ds m−1) reduces cotton yield and increases the risk of salt and –N leaching to groundwater. Additional N fertilizer input may overcome some of the negative effects of salinity on cotton growth, but also increases the potential risks for nitrate leaching.",

It is a relatively drought tolerant crop attaining higher biomass production per unit area. Genetic diversity present in breeding populations is a raw material for selection of parental genotypes with desirable and complementary traits. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic diversity present among Tanzania grown sweetpotato germplasm to select promising breeding parents with enhanced yield and yield-related traits and dry matter content. Procedures: Seventy six sweetpotato accessions collected from Tanzania and 20 sweetpotato accessions received from International Potato Centre (CIP) in Lima/Peru were characterized in two seasons. The study was conducted using a 16 x 6 triple lattice design. The data collected included 16 morphological traits using CIPs standard descriptors. Data were analysed using multivariate procedure including cluster analysis and principle component analysis. Results and conclusions: The tested sweetpotato collections differed significantly for storage root yield, dry matter content (DMC) and number of roots per plot. Genotypes New Kawogo, Kiti cha Nyerere and Kisu cha Masai had the highest root yields whereas genotypes Ngw’anangusa, Rugomoka and Secondary had significantly higher mean DMC. Traits considered in the study revealed positive and significant correlations. The first four principal components accounted for 69.33% of the variations present in the tested sweetpotato genotypes. Cluster analysis grouped the studied genotypes into two major classes with genetic diversity of 0.54. The selected genotypes can be recommended for future breeding programs to bolster yield and dry matter content of sweetpotato under western Tanzania conditions.",

Soil (250 g) amended with solid beef manure (SM), straw-bedded solid beef manure (BM), urea only (UO), and control (CT) were incubated at 5, 10, 15, and 25 °C for 31 days at constant 60% water holding capacity (WHC). The cumulative GHGs and NH3 emission generally increased with temperature and highest emission observed at 25 °C. Across temperature levels, 0.11–1.3% and 0.1–0.7% of the total N was lost as N2O and NH3, respectively. Cumulative CO2 emission from manure was higher than UO and CT at all temperatures (P < 0.05). Methane accounted for <0.1% of the total C (CO2 + CH4) emission across temperatures. The Q10 values (temperature sensitivity coefficient) derived from Arrhenius and exponential models ranged 1.5–3.7 for N2O, 1.4–6.4 for CO2, 1.6–5.8 for CH4, and 1.4–5.0 for NH3. Our results demonstrated that temperature significantly influences NH3 and GHG emissions irrespective of soil amendment but the magnitude of emission varied with soil nutrient availability and substrate quality. Overall, the highest temperature resulted in the highest emission of NH3 and GHGs.",

The experimental design was a randomised complete block design with four replicates arranged in a 2 × 5×2 factorial scheme: Two N sources [(urea and urea with inhibitor of the enzyme NBPT (N – (n – butyl thiophosphoric) Triamide))], five N doses applied in top-dressing (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha−1), with and without inoculation with A. brasilense. The increase in N doses reduced the nitrogen fertilisation efficiency. No significant differences were observed among the N sources. Inoculation increased the AE of nitrogen sources and can increase RAN. The increase in N dose up to 140 kg ha−1 associated with inoculation increased wheat grain yield.",

The addition of two rows of buckwheat resulted in a significant decrease in seed yield of both soybean cultivars compared to control. The seeds of both cultivars had significantly higher fat content and better fatty acid composition in both variants of intercropping with buckwheat compared to soybean monoculture. Significant changes in the amino acid composition were noted in the seeds of Mavka cultivar, in which glutamic and aspartic acids were the most abundant and the cultivation with two rows of buckwheat additionally increased their content. Intercropping of soybean with buckwheat significantly reduced weed infestation in both tested soybean cultivars. The presented results confirm the assumed hypothesis and the most advantageous variant turned out to be the cultivation of soybean with one row of buckwheat.",

Complete resistance has not yet been reported in apple, but variation in levels of partial resistance has been described and could be valuable in plant breeding programmes. A screening method based on spore inoculation of manually inflicted leaf scars on cut shoots was evaluated for reliability and repeatability in discrimination of 11 apple cultivars during two years – 2012 and 2013 – in two different facilities – biotron and standard greenhouse – and different time periods (February–May). The resulting cankers were counted (infection percentage), first appearance noted (incubation period) and lesion size measured at regular intervals during a period of 25–29 days for comparison of resistance levels. Results of two-way analysis of variance and correlation analyses showed that the area under the disease progress curve yielded the most robust data. This parameter was then applied for screening 30 apple cultivars using the same cut-shoot method. 'Elise' showed very high susceptibility, while the ornamental 'Prairifire' showed the highest level of partial resistance. Results suggested that cut shoots can be used to assess levels of resistance among cultivars, but great care must be taken to provide stable experimental conditions.",

The soil strength was assessed by laboratory measurements of the precompression stress (Pc) at −6 kPa in topsoil (20 cm) and subsoil (40 and 60 cm) samples. Stress propagation, elastic and plastic deformation during wheeling were measured in the field with combined stress-state-transducer and displacement transducer system. Results presented in this study show that minimum tilled soil had 74% higher Pc than ploughed soil in the upper soil layer, whilst differences were less distinct in subsoil. Wheeling increased Pc at all soil depths. Compared to ploughing, higher strength in the upper layer of minimum tilled soil led on average to 60% and 48% reductions in the major principal stress with the use of the light and heavy slurry tanker, respectively. The extent of the major principal stress was dependent on the ground pressure in the topsoil. The first pass of a wheel caused the greatest damage in some cases, but all wheelings led to accumulative plastic deformation in both vertical and horizontal directions. Wheeling with high intensity would have exceeded Pc in all cases when soil was at a matric potential of −6 kPa. The results show that soil water content is an important factor influencing bearing capacity. Drier soil (−100 kPa), in combination with minimum tillage, limited the occurrence of stresses exceeding Pc in the upper soil layer.",

The present study considers changes in flavonols, sugars, and two amino acids in onion bulbs during a long-term storage in the ambient dark storage room and in glasshouse equipped with a climate control system. Flavonol and sugar contents were found to fluctuate noticeably during the storage period. Amino acid content remained relatively unchanged till the onset of inner sprouting, increasing afterward. Visible sprouts appeared at week 22 in the dark storage room and for four weeks later in the glasshouse. The bulbs lost 20–30% of their weight depending on storage conditions at the end of the storage trials. At the same time, the content of nutraceutics in study expressed on the dry weight basis remained of the same order of magnitude. The nature of observed variations in chemical composition of onions as well as relation of this phenomenon to physiological development of stored onion bulbs is discussed. A conclusion is made that the \"Sunpower\" onion cannot sustain overwinter storage.",

    "abstract": "Arkansas Discovery Farms (ADFs) are private farms that collaborate with on-farm research, verification, and demonstration of farming's impact on the environment. We have nine ADFs representing livestock (broiler poultry and pasture grazed beef and sheep) and row crop agriculture (corn, cotton, rice, soybean, and wheat), where we collect water use and water quality data as a function of conservation management, using autosamplers equipped with edge-of-field H-flumes or weir flow structures, which measure and collect surface runoff. On the poultry farms, we are monitoring nutrient and sediment runoff originating immediately near poultry houses due to concerns with spillage of litter during bird removal and house clean out, as well as dust from tunnel ventilation. On a nearby farm we are assessing the impact of rotational grazing on water quality, soil organic matter, and soil health metrics. On the row crop farms we are assessing the impacts of conservation tillage and cover crops on soybean–corn rotations and cotton on nutrient and sediment runoff and the benefits of water harvesting and reuse of water conservation and quality. The information in this paper while preliminary, demonstrates how a state-wide on-farm demonstration program operates. Elevated nutrient and sediment runoff from around poultry production areas are decreased three-fold by directing runoff into ponds or through grassed waterways. While conservation tillage and cover crops do decrease nutrient and sediment runoff, no significant difference between conventional and conservation operations is yet to be realized. Importantly, ADF empowers farmers to proactively address environmental concerns. This paper discusses the development, guidance, principals, and goals of ADF and contrasts this with other farm monitoring projects, where the sources of nutrient impairment are the subject of ongoing litigation. Monitoring in divisive and transparent situations presents unique challenges with data ownership and release of findings, which can hinder productive outcomes of such monitoring.",

For this purpose, two bottle gourd landraces and one green pumpkin cultivar and a cucumber cultivar were grown under controlled conditions at three levels of water stress. Landraces had longer vines than hybrids while hybrid varieties produced more leaves than landraces at all levels of water treatments. The responses of landraces and hybrids to water stress were similar in that they all showed lower chlorophyll content index, stomatal conductance and plant growth in response to decreasing water availability. However, the landraces showed better stomatal regulation indicating better acclimation to water stress. The comparable performance of landraces to the exotic pumpkin and cucumber varieties and their water stress tolerance suggests that bottle gourd could be promoted as an alternative food security crop in rural communities.",

An open-field experiment was conducted to establish a proper irrigation scheme with saline water for cherry tomato in the Minqin oasis, where very severe salinization occurs. The experiment had four treatments including fresh or saline irrigation over the crop season (control, C, T3), fresh/saline-water irrigation change on days after thinning 50 (DAT 50, T1) and saline/fresh irrigation change on DAT 50 (T2). Leaf area index (LAI), photosynthesis rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), leaf dry matter (LDM), stem dry matter (StDM), yield, marketable fruit and total soluble solids (TSS) of tomato were measured. Saline irrigation, irrespective of the timing, significantly decreased maximum LAI, LDM and StDM, Pn, Tr and stomatal conductance but significantly stimulated water use efficiency. The reduction in maximum LAI, LDM and StDM was lower in T2 than in T1 and T3. Harvest index (HI) and TSS were higher in T2 and T3 than in T1 and C. Marketable fruit had no significant change in T2 but significantly declined in T1 and T3. Maximum saturated soil conductivity without yield reduction (the salt tolerance threshold) was 3.69 dS m−1. Total yield of tomato would decrease by 9.85% with one unit increase of soil salinityhigher than the threshold. Final yield significantly reduced by 24.6% and 23.1% in T1 and T3 treatments, respectively. Our results suggest that irrigation with saline water before DAT 50 and fresh water after DAT 50 should be advocated for cherry tomato plantation in water-scarce areas like the Minqin oasis.",

A lack of improved sorghum varieties was the major sorghum production constraint reported by 82.8% of participants. Farmer preferred ideal sorghum varieties were short to medium plant height with high grain yield. The quality attributes mostly preferred by farmers were baking quality, nutrition, and seed colour. Farmers in the study areas mainly grew unimproved sorghum varieties with low food values. Overall, the study provides the current evidence on sorghum production constraints and farmer-preferred attributes that will guide sorghum nutritional quality breeding with farmer preferred traits.",

    "abstract": "Integrating forage legumes with maize has the potential to restore soil fertility and increase grain yield among smallholder farming systems. A study was conducted over two cropping seasons to determine the effect of intercropping maize with forage legumes on soil fertility restoration, weed biomass and maize yield. Treatments involved: four cropping systems (sole maize, maize-velvet bean, maize-silverleaf, maize-cowpeas) and four fertiliser regimes (no fertiliser, 150 kg ha−1 of compound D fertiliser (7% N: 14% P2O5: 7% K2O) + 150 kg ha−1 ammonium nitrate (34.5% N), 100 kg ha−1 single super phosphate (SSP, 17.5% P2O5) and 200 kg ha−1 SSP). Maize-velvet bean intercropping reduced weed biomass by 80% relative to sole maize and maize-silverleaf intercropping. Maize-cowpea and maize-velvet bean intercropping reduced maize grain yield by 25.9% and 64.7%, respectively, compared to sole maize and maize-silverleaf intercropping. In 2017/2018, maize-silverleaf intercropping increased resin-extractable P2O5 by 60.1% compared to other cropping systems while the three fertiliser treatments increased the levels of this nutrient by 41.9–100%. The results of this study show that intercropping maize with silverleaf has the potential to restore soil fertility and control weeds, without reducing maize grain yield.",

The presence of weeds is to be detected and should be classified in the earlier stage to improve the growth of species. This research work considers paddy cultivation and detection of weeds in the paddy field.Methods The modelling of the automatic weed predictor model aids farmers in handling the weed coverage and scattering of weed in the agricultural field. Real-time data is collected from the agricultural region, and the images are provided as the input for the predictor model. Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) is proposed to segment the weed from the input images.Results The model is proposed to address the segmentation problem by concurrent simulation of the task for object prediction. Simulation is carried out in a MATLAB environment. The performance of R-CNN is compared and evaluated with existing approaches like the conventional CNN model and other segmentation approaches.Conclusion The proposed model gives better results when compared to other approaches.",

The percentage of farmers that used hybrid seed in 2019 and 2020 were 32.4% and 22.5%, respectively. Of the four hybrids varieties grown, none was locally produced and over 83% of the farmers indicated readiness to adopt maize hybrid seed.

However, its production and productivity are mainly constrained by bacterial and fungal diseases. A field survey was conducted to determine the prevalence, incidence, severity and association of factors influencing common bacterial blight (CBB) and anthracnose epidemics in major bean growing areas of Ethiopia, during 2019. In three regions within six zones from 12 districts, a total of 180 common bean fields were assessed for CBB and anthracnose. The results revealed that CBB and anthracnose were 100% prevalent though CBB was more severe than anthracnose. The logistic regression model showed CBB and anthracnose components were significantly associated with biophysical factors. High CBB incidence (>70%) at Ambo, Arsi-Negele and Shashemene-zuriya and high severity (>30%) at Ambo, Boricha and Shahsemene-zuriya were strongly associated with sole cropping, July sowing, poor weeding practices, maturity stage and own saved seeds. Anthracnose incidence of >50% and severity of >30% had high probabilities of associations with zones, sole cropping, own saved seeds, variety, poor weeding practices and maturity stages. The study indicated that CBB and anthracnose are severe and 100% prevalent in Ethiopia, and efforts should be done towards the usage of clean seeds, weeding practices, following appropriate sowing dates and other appropriate agronomic practices to manage the diseases.",

Four sweet sorghum genotypes were inoculated with three mycorrhiza species under greenhouse conditions. The plants were evaluated for growth parameters such as shoot height, root length, root morphology (root surface, root diameter and volume), shoot and root dry weight, uptake of macro and micro mineral nutrients, root colonisation and mycorrhizal dependency. Mycorrhizal species significantly improved growth and productivity of sorghum genotypes. Inoculation of Funneliformis mosseae, Claroideoglomus claroideum and Claroideoglomus etunicatum resulted in the highest shoot and total dry matter biomass production in Ashana, Hereahri and Yellow genotypes, respectively. Mycorrhiza inoculated white genotype had higher root colonisation and root development, and shoot P, K, Ca and Mg contents. Yellow genotypes produced significantly higher shoot and total dry weight and also were highly mycorrhiza dependent among the four genotypes. Compared to the control treatment mycorrhizal inoculation increased shoot Zn concentration but had non-consistent effects on shoot Cu, Fe and Mn contents. Conclusively, our findings confirmed that sweet sorghum genotypes responded selectively to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonisation for their growth parameters and nutrients uptake.",

    "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) drive climate change, with agricultural land significantly contributing, influenced by soil properties. While extensive research exists on environmental and management impacts on GHG emissions across various soils and climates, understanding key factors influencing GHG emissions from clay soil in temperate climates is limited. This study aims to investigate the combination of environmental and management factors reducing N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions from clay soil in temperate climates. Recognising the potential of reduced tillage and legume-based crop rotations in mitigating GHG emissions, we investigate their impact on soil emissions. The conventionally managed field with spring barley, field beans, winter wheat, and winter rapeseed rotation demonstrates the lowest average N2O emission (3.7 g N2O ha−1 d−1), while the field with winter crops in a reduced tillage rotation shows the highest N2O emission (8.5 g N2O ha−1 d−1). A rotation with winter crops, beans twice, and barley, under conventional management, demonstrates the highest CO2 emission (140.2 kg CO2 ha−1 d−1), while the lowest CO2 emission is observed in a rotation with winter crops, beans, and barley under reduced tillage management (100.8 kg CO2 ha−1 d−1). CH4 assimilation ranges from 3.1 to 5.4 CH4 g ha−1 d−1 across all rotation and tillage combinations. However, ANCOVA results indicate that the volumes of GHG emissions are significantly influenced by the interaction of environmental and management factors, where precipitation is the most significant factor in the interaction with other environmental factors, soil tillage, and crop residues for N2O and CO2 emissions, while CH4 emissions are influenced by the interaction of air temperature with other environmental factors, soil tillage, and crop residues. This underscores the need to consider both management and relevant environmental factors when evaluating the impact of practices on GHG emissions from clay soil in temperate climates.",

Three onion cultivars were tested during two storage seasons, and quality indicators such as firmness, sugar content, dry matter content and mineral content were measured. All but one of the samples were treated with maleic hydrazide for sprouting inhibition. Contents of fructose and glucose were found to be connected to the extent of sprouting, with the highest contents coinciding with the onset of sprouting in spring. Firmness and dry matter losses differed between samples from different growing conditions with firmness losses up to 35.2% and dry matter losses between 4.9% and 11.1% found. Dry matter content was significantly connected to the fraction of sprouted bulbs in a sample. While firmness had a decreasing trend for all but one sample, the firmness measurements carried out with a handheld penetrometer were not consistent enough to be a reliable indicator of sprouting.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate Norwegian heritage apple cultivars from a pomological, agronomical, and chemical point of view, identify the most important quality parameters, and select cultivars with desirable traits for modern markets and breeding purposes. In total 75 heritage and 4 standard apple cultivars were evaluated at the Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research – NIBIO Ullensvang, during 2018–2020. Based on individual investigations of various fruit quality characters, cultivar groups with special properties were selected for the industry, for making concentrate and fresh juice, and for medical properties. According to the soluble solid content, sweetness index, fruit size, acid, dry matter, and phenolic content, several groups of cultivars have high potential value for modern breeding programmes.

Soil physical analyses were performed 6 years after the start of the trial and soil chemical analyses after 10 years. A marked plough pan was found at a depth of 23–27 cm with the reference ploughing depth. Deeper ploughing gave a greater storage capacity for plant available moisture, but somewhat lower total nutrient reserves than shallower ploughing. Shallow tillage led to increased soil density, but not to such an extent that soil aeration was likely to be limiting. The concentration of organic matter increased in the surface layer with shallow tillage, but the total amount present differed little between treatments when related to a fixed mass of topsoil. Crop yields were not affected by the time of ploughing, and only to a relatively minor extent by the depth of ploughing. Overall spring cereal yields increased slightly with shallow tillage, whilst potato yields declined slightly. Slightly later maturation was found in both cereals and potatoes with shallow than with deeper tillage, owing to a delay in early development.",

Lack of proportionality between Fe(II) and P in solution was attributed to microbial uptake, resorption of P and also, at high Fe(II)‐concentrations, to precipitation of Fe(II)‐P compounds (e.g. vivianite). The highest P concentrations were observed in samples amended with the low‐C dose, where the concentrations increased six‐fold to approximately 0.3 mg PO4‐P 1−1. This indicated that P leaching might increase from clayey soils subjected to moderately reducing conditions.",

The concentrations varied little with time but tended to increase with depth. The concentrations were less in fresh manure than in stored manure, and less in cattle manure than in pig manure. The rate of release of N2O from the manure surface was also determined. The mean rate from stored pig manure was 11 mg N2O-N m−2 h−1, which is low compared to typical total-N losses. The production of N2O is probably caused by microbial denitrification but could also arise from nitrification. The release of N2O may be accompanied by a greater release of N2, as the conditions in manure favour the denitrification process going to completion.",

Reliable data for Trøndelag (1973–;2000) and Valldal (1975)–;2000) were used. A strong correlation between yield level and fungicide used against Botrytis cinerea was found for Valldal, but not for Trøndelag. For both districts yield was negatively correlated with temperatures in August previous to the fruiting year. In Valldal yield was positively correlated with temperature in April. Yield level was not significantly correlated with meteorological data during flowering and harvesting. Several regression equations for predicting yield were estimated; meteorological data, fungicides and year were used as variables. The crossvalidation of the equations showed a good accuracy. The results indicated that climatic conditions during flower induction and flower differentiation were more important for yield than conditions during flowering and ripening. The regression method for predicting yield may be useful for the production and marketing of strawberries.

The aim was to find if there were differences in HNT values between the winter wheat cultivars investigated, and to assess whether these values could be used for prediction of grain protein content (GPC). In Experiment 1, chlorophyll meter readings were taken at growth stages (GS) Zadoks 31 and 55 in five winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars in 17 annual field trials located in southeast Norway in 1996, 1997, and 1998. There were significant differences in HNT values between cultivars at both GS 31 and 55, but no differences were found between the three most commonly used cultivars in Norway at present, cvs. Bjørke, Mjølner and Rudolf. Because of the variation between years the HNT values at GS 55 were found to be unsuitable for direct prediction of the GPC. In Experiment 2, HNT was used in 21 annual N-fertilizer trials with winter wheat, performed in 1996 and 1997 and located in southeast Norway. A delay in the measurements from GS 55 to GS 65 generally improved the GPC prediction in 1996. Nitrogen applied at GS 55 increased GPC by approximately 1 unit of percent in cv. Folke, regardless of HNT value, while in cv. Portal nitrogen applied at this stage gave no increase in GPC at HNT values beyond 700.",

To evaluate the reliability of the estimates of clover content, the clover on paper printouts of non-processed images were marked manually and analysed by a photo scanner and commercially available software. The outputs from Trifolium.exe and the estimates from scanned manual markings were highly correlated (r 2=0.81). A sensitivity test was conducted to quantify the impact of changes of six user-adjustable parameters of Trifolium.exe. The software output of clover coverage was sensitive for changes in three, soil coverage for changes in one, and weed coverage for changes in all parameters.

Our research indicated that successful wintering of winter oilseed rape depends directly on sowing date. From the data obtained it may be seen that differences between sowing dates and overwintering were statistically significant. Overwintering depends on numbers of growing-degree-days (GDD) in the autumn vegetative period.

Experiments were carried out in the Akdeniz University, Faculty of Agriculture experimental fields located at the Mediterranean coastal region of Turkey in 1997–2000. Seed yield strongly correlated with straw yield. A moderate positive correlation was observed between seed yield and number of seeds per plant, spring vigour, and number of pods per plant. Heritability for 1000-seed weight, number of podding nodes, harvest index and number of days to flowering were higher than other traits. Results in this study demonstrated that seed yield of common vetch could be improved by bulk selections based on number of days to flowering, harvest index, number of podding nodes and most importantly on 1000-seed weight traits by selecting the promising accessions.",

Statistical analysis revealed that SOC and STN presented moderate spatial variability in the small catchment, and varied with land use. The SOC and STN contents and variations were also influenced by the five land use patterns in a complex manner. Geostatistical analysis showed that Gaussian models were the best fitting descriptors for these SOC and STN data set. The nugget-to-sill ratio ranged from 39.4–56.3% for SOC semivariograms, and 42.6–59.0% for STN semivariograms, indicating moderate spatial dependence at the three soil depths. Regression analysis indicated that land uses, topographic variables, and soil texture accounted for approximately 57.3% of the SOC variability and 70.1% of the STN variability for the 0–0.10 m soil layer. All regression models were reasonable enough to predict SOC and STN in similar loess areas. It was proposed that creating a mosaic pattern to increase spatial variation of areas by land use arrangement would be an effective management strategy to trap soil nutrients to stay in the ecosystem. Our data also suggested that more C input such as manure addition and crop residues return, and alternative cultivation practices such as application of contour cultivation and building terraces for soil erosion control would improve SOC and nutrients on the hilly areas similar to the Loess Plateau of China.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The investigations aimed to: 1) evaluate water erosion rates on undulating slopes in Lithuania under different land use systems; 2) study changes in soil physical properties on the differently eroded slopes; and 3) better understand relationships between soil physical properties and soil erodibility. Research data were obtained on loamy sand and clay loam Eutric Albeluvisols located on the undulating hilly relief of the Žemaičiai Uplands of Western Lithuania. The results of 18 years of water erosion investigations under different land use systems on slopes of varying steepness are presented. Attention is focused on changes in soil physical properties in relation to soil erosion severity. Measured water erosion rates in the field experiments were: 3.2–8.6 m3 ha−1 yr−1 under winter rye, 9.0–27.1 m3 ha−1 yr−1 under spring barley and 24.2–87.1 m3 ha−1 yr−1 under potatoes. Perennial grasses completely prevented water erosion, while erosion-preventive grass-grain crop rotations (67% grasses, 33% cereal grains) decreased soil losses by 75–80% compared to the field crop rotation, containing 17% tillage crops (potatoes), 33% grasses and 50% cereal grains. The grain-grass crop rotation (33% grasses and 67% cereal grains) decreased soil erosion rates by 23–24%. The percentage of clay-silt and clay fractions of arable soil horizons increased, while the total soil porosity and moisture retention capacity decreased with increased soil erosion. Phytocenoses, including sod-forming perennial grasses and grass-grain crop rotations, led to changes in the physical properties of eroded soils; soil bulk density decreased and percentage total porosity and moisture retention capacity increased. The grass-grain crop rotations increased the water-stable soil structure (measured as water-stable soil aggregates) by 11.03 per cent units and sod-forming perennial grasses increased aggregate stability by 9.86 per cent units compared with the grain-grass crop rotation on the 10–14° slope. Therefore, grass-grain crop rotations and sod-forming perennial grasses decreased soil erodibility and thus could assist both erosion control and the ecological stability of the vulnerable hilly-undulating landscape.",

The trials included studies 1) on losses during winter of soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin, 0–90 cm soil), accumulated after the preceding crops in late autumn, 2) on soil N mineralisation (Nnet) during the growing season of the wheat (early spring to ripeness) and 3) on grain yield and optimum N fertilisation (Opt-N rate) of the wheat. Average Nmin in late autumn following winter oilseed rape, peas, and oats was 68, 64, and 45 kg ha−1, respectively, but decreased until early spring. Increased future losses of Nmin during the winter in central Sweden due to no or very short periods with soil frost should enhance the demand for fertiliser N and reduce the better residual N effect of winter oilseed rape and peas, compared with oats. Their better N effect will then mainly depend on larger Nnet (from March to maturity during the winter wheat year). Owing to more plant-available soil N (mainly as Nnet) Opt-N rates were lower after oilseed rape and peas than after oats despite increased wheat yields (700 kg ha−1) at optimum N fertilisation. In addition to these break crop effects, a milder climate should increase winter wheat yields in central Sweden by 2000–3000 kg ha−1 and require about 30–45 kg ha−1 more fertiliser N at optimum N fertilisation than the present yield levels. Increased losses and higher N fertilisation to the subsequent winter wheat in future indicates a need for an estimation of the residual N effect at the individual sites, rather than using mean values as at present, to increase N efficiency.",

Momotarou] plants were grown under potted conditions inside the greenhouse of Hiroshima University, Japan. The effects of salinity stress under either ambient or elevated CO2 atmospheric conditions during the fruit-growth period were compared. Stem was the major sink organ for the carbon assimilates from the source leaves. A simple nondestructive micromorphometric technique was used to measure growth of these organs. The effect of salt stress under ambient air or elevated CO2 concentration was studied on the apparent photosynthesis (source activity), partitioning 13C, Na content, and antioxidative enzymes. Compared with the control (without salt), salt-stress treatment severely decreased whole-plant biomass. The treatment also depressed leaf photosynthesis and transport of 13C assimilates; however, the impact of stress on these activities was alleviated under elevated CO2 concentration and such alleviation was promoted when sink activity relative to source activity was higher, suggesting that sink activity is involved in alleviation of photosynthesis impaired from salinity. Catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities increased by salinity stress but they decreased by elevated CO2. These results suggested that salinity stress suppresses stem growth in tomato plants; however, the adverse effect is alleviated under elevated CO2 concentration due not to elevation of source activity in leaves but to activation of sink activity, probably owing to improvement of oxidative stress as well as the water status through stomatal closure at high CO2 concentration.",

The influence of coating film on germination energy, germination percentage, seedling growth, antifeedant rate, safety performance, and field growth of the soybean plants was studied in a series of tests and are described in this paper. The effect of increasing yield of this coating agent was tested in experiments conducted in both laboratory and field. Result of the tests showed that the crop yield of soybean seeds coated by the novel seed-coating agent was increased by 17.95%, and at 25.75% less cost, as compared with a traditional soybean seed-coating agent. The antifeedant test of the novel seed-coating agent showed that it had an excellent antifeedant effect and a unique efficacy in pest control as determined by the analysis of feeding area of the leaves and selective antifeedant rate. The acute toxicity test on Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats confirmed that it was safe for the public and meets environmental requirements during usage and disposal so it may show obvious economic and environmental benefits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Earthworms influence soil fertility, and their population is known to be influenced by fertilization. The objective of this study is to characterize the abundance of earthworms under three different kinds of rotation-crops (Rotation: cereals–legumes for green manure-cotton), three tillage systems (Conventional Tillage CT, Minimum Tillage MT, & No-Tillage NT) and fertilization (NP: inorganic and FYM: farmyard manure-organic). Significantly higher populations of earthworms were found under the legumes and NT system in contrast to the lowest abundance determined under the cotton and CT system. Earthworm populations benefited more from organic fertilization than from NP. Our study showed that the most important factors for earthworm abundance are the macropores and Corg under Mediterranean conditions. No-till management considerably influenced the improvement of the physical and chemical soil properties and increased the earthworm abundance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A field study was conducted in Thailand under a rain-fed environment to determine the effect of four different cutting heights above ground level and two closing dates on dry matter (DM) production, yield components, and fodder quality of five different cultivars of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach), all treatments cut with the same frequency of approximately 4 weeks. Eighteen quantitative trait measurements were used to investigate the interactions between cultivar diversity and cutting regimes. Principal-component analysis (PCA) showed a clustering of two distinct cultivars and another group of cultivars in one cluster without obvious structure. There was also a clear clustering of the control (0 cm cutting height) across all cultivars whereas other cutting heights affected growth differently according to cultivar. The optimal cutting regime for obtaining high DM yield depended on the genetic background and did not relate to a reduction in the number of vegetative buds for the cultivars with a basal shooting pattern. For the cultivars with higher DM yield arising from high stubble height, the DM was differently distributed into leaf and stem material. Before cuttings, the tiller number was reduced in the control plots but not in the plots with more lenient cutting height. Average tiller yield increased with increasing cutting height to reach a maximum at 20-cm cutting height. Average harvested culm length was constant for the four cutting heights. The variation in a number of plant traits, arising from cultivar diversity, can be altered by agronomic practices, thereby causing potentially contradictory results. Defining specific interactions of cultivar-by-cutting height treatments and analysing these with PCA proved to be a useful approach for visualising clusters from multiple measurements. The proposed approach for analysing data could serve as a model for other trials with similar interactions between cultivar diversity and agronomic treatments.",

Selected bacterial isolates were first screened against R. leguminosarum in a dual culture. Some of the tested isolates significantly inhibited the growth of R. leguminosarum. Soil inoculation of these isolates had a significant growth-reducing effect on clover seedlings. Leaf-spray treatment of bacteria had a significant impact on clover growth. Depending on the plant growth stage, this effect can reach up to 86% reduction in clover shoot dry weight. Different temperatures did not influence the effect on clover. The growth-reducing effect of bacteria was also shown on another important dicotyledonous weed, Chenopodium album.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The market for cereal cover crop straw and herbage seed straw has diminished in many seed-production areas due to there being less livestock. Seed growers therefore want to chop and return the straw both in the sowing year and in the seed-harvest years. The objectives of this research were (1) to compare decomposition rates of straw of barley and wheat cover crops and timothy (Phleum pratense L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) seed crops, (2) to study the effect on soil microbial activity of adding mineral nitrogen or fresh leaves from undersown seed crops, and (3) to evaluate the effect of straw placement/soil contact on straw-decomposition rates. Microbial activity/straw-decomposition rates were evaluated by regular measurement of CO2 production in four laboratory incubation experiments lasting for 150–161 days. Microbial activity was always enhanced by adding straw on the soil surface. Straw of barley resulted in higher CO2 production than did straw of wheat, while straw of red clover and meadow fescue resulted in higher CO2 production than with straw of timothy. Inclusion of fresh leaves of white clover and timothy increased CO2 production during the first and second half of the incubation experiments, respectively. Neither in the sowing year nor in the seed-harvest year was microbial activity stimulated by adding fertilizer nitrogen, but soil mineral nitrogen by the end of the experiments was higher after adding fertilizer or fresh leaves, and lower after adding grass seed straw. Presumably owing to higher humidity, straw decomposition in a field experiment was higher in timothy stubble than in wheat stubble and higher at 2 cm than at 10 cm above the soil surface. For practical seed production, growers are recommended to leave short stubble, to chop the straw as finely as possible, and to distribute the straw evenly on the surface in close contact with soil particles.",

The measurements included the determination: (a) of substrate characteristics, and (b) both turfgrass quality and physiological status as indicated by the green turf cover (GTC), normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) and stomatal resistance. It was found that during the establishment and growth period, the compost-amended substrate improved the GTC compared with those amended with peat. In contrast substrate S15:Pum40:Per20:P20:Z5 improved the drought tolerance of Z. matrella during the drought period compared with the compost-amended substrate. Deeper profiles improved the establishment, growth and drought tolerance of turfgrass compared with the shallower profiles. All three factors (substrate type and depth and irrigation regimes) proved to be influential for turfgrass growth and quality during the drought stress period. During the drought period, the GTC and NDVI were higher and stomatal resistance was lower for the peat-amended substrate, the deeper profiles (15 cm) and the higher irrigation regime (6 mm every 3 days).",

The objective of this investigation was to determine the water extractable concentration of seven trace elements (Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Mo, Pb and Cd) and to assess their relationship with soil properties of the Danube basin in Croatia. Soil samples from the surface layer (0–25 cm) of 74 sites, having different land uses (forest and agricultural land), were collected. Samples were analysed for total and water extractable trace elements as well as for pH, DOC, SOC and CEC. The concentrations of water extractable fraction of trace elements were on average: 20.14 mg kg−1 for Fe, 3.61 mg kg−1 for Mn, 0.07 mg kg−1 for Ni, 0.016 mg kg−1 for Co, 0.01 mg kg−1 for Mo, 0.01 mg kg−1 for Pb and 0.0009 mg kg−1 for Cd. Soil properties were in the following range: pH 4.3–8 (Avg: 6.35), DOC 6.1–73 mg l−1 (Avg: 26 mg l−1), CEC 1.3–24 cmol kg−1 (Avg: 9 cmol kg−1) and SOC 0.5–5% (Avg: 1.7%). The concentration of water extractable fraction of trace elements was significantly correlated with pH (p <0.001), DOC (p <0.001 – p <0.05) and CEC (p <0.001) but their relationship with total content of trace element and SOC was rather weak, suggesting that total metal alone cannot be an indicator of toxicity or deficiency. Results show that pH, DOC and CEC are important soil quality parameters taking part in the solubility control of trace metals in the soil rather than their total concentration. The difference between land uses has been observed as well, suggesting that a change in land use can cause a change in trace element solubility.",

    "abstract": "Perennial sow-thistle (Sonchus arvensis L.) may be a serious weed in organic and conventional farming. To assess the effects of radiation acquisition and resource allocation on competitive ability, S. arvensis was grown together with spring barley (Hordeum distichon L.) in six mixtures in a replacement series with initial above-ground biomass proportions of S. arvensis ranging from 2% to 96%. A one-season experiment was made outdoors in boxes in Uppsala, Sweden, at a low level of nitrogen supply (5 g N m−2). The study tested the predictability of shoot biomass of each species based on two principal assumptions: (i) growth model parameters derived from species in monocultures could be applied in mixtures, and (ii) radiation in the mixed stand was partitioned between species proportional to their leaf area. Calibration of two parameters, for scaling of shoot radiation use efficiency and radiation partitioning respectively, were the base for the evaluation. When the coefficients were close to unity, which was the case for all mixtures dominated by barley, and for one of the mixtures with high proportion of S. arvensis in the early season, observed and predicted shoot biomass coincided well. For the evenly composed mixtures, total shoot biomass was underestimated (the scaling coefficient of shoot radiation use efficiency was>1), whereas the relative composition among species was predicted well. In the late season the principal model assumptions were not applicable to S. arvensis, likely due to increasing root allocation not accounted for in the model. Sonchus arvensis in mixtures with high proportions was planted early in relation to sowing of barley, which resulted in a comparably late development stage of S. arvensis. Consequently the relation between species development stages varied with species composition suggesting a need to introduce effects of differences in development stage into the model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The re-emergence and modernization of traditional goat-cheese production in Jämtland led to the articulation of a localized agri-food system that represents the frontline of the return and reinforcement of local food in Sweden. Already in the 1970s, some initiatives were undertaken to formalize the productive activities of this branch and to improve the product quality. The most important project was the articulation of a cooperative that, unlike all other Swedish cooperatives, engaged its members in the development of a joint trademark, development of a standardized assortment, common marketing efforts and finding creative solutions for infrastructure problems. Despite the overall success, we also found some downsides. Producing goat cheese requires that at least two people are involved, because the workload often leads to body injuries and illness for people working alone. By studying the institutional frameworks, rules and regulations, the economic function and entrepreneurial dynamics, and the dynamics of knowledge and competences, the article highlights how and why farm dairies in Jämtland became reinforced and modernized. This grasps both the actions of individual economic agents and their interaction with their environment. A special emphasis was put on the role of regional authorities in this process. Even though many obstacles have been removed and the trade has found successful ways to solve strategic issues concerning product development and marketing, there are still important structural shortcomings that might decrease the profitability and endanger the future development of the trade. There is a lack of experience and infrastructure to solve more complex problems like animal health and the potential risks related to the consumption of unpasteurized cheese and the increasing incidence of Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE).",

Unfortunately, there is a lack of information on hulled wheat characteristics when a whole plant is used as forage. Therefore, a field trial was carried out in southern Italy during 2010–2011 to evaluate the effect of N applications (0, 40, and 80 kg ha−1) and harvest period (cut at boots just swollen and cut at early dough) on forage yield and quality of two emmer varieties (“Padre Pio” and “Giovanni Paolo”) and one of spelt (“Altamura”) on their biomass yield and nutritional traits as well as carbohydrates fractionation. Data indicated that the harvest stage and genotype affected forage yield and quality significantly, while N fertilization has influenced some qualitative parameters. Old wheat cultivars tested had considerable yield and forage quality, and they seem to be adapted to marginal lands in the absence of N fertilization. Therefore, from our findings we can conclude that the emmer could be recommended for hay production harvested at booting stage given its valuable nutritional characteristics, whereas spelt results to be more adaptable for silage production when harvested at the early dough stage.",

There are not sufficient investigations about the influence of sulphur on the quality of yield. The objective of this work was to investigate the content and quality of protein in wheat grain depending on sulphur fertilization. The present study relies on field trials conducted on two different soils during 2004–2009. Sulphur was applied with NS-fertilizer Axan or Axan Super at the rate of S 10 or 13.6 kg ha−1 accompanied by a nitrogen background of N 100 kg ha−1. The rates of N- and NS-fertilizers were divided and applied at the beginning and at the end of tillering. At harvest, the grain samples from trial variants in four replications were taken, and the contents of crude protein, wet gluten, amino acids (lysine, threonine, cysteine, methionine) and gluten index in wheat grain were determined. Besides, the contents of amino acids were recalculated on their concentrations in protein. The protein and wet gluten contents in grain varied significantly depending on weather conditions of the trial years. On break-stony soil, sulphur increased the yield by 1.16 t ha−1 on average, i.e. by 21.7%. With increasing yields the protein and wet gluten concentrations in grain decreased. Under the influence of sulphur, the gluten index increased significantly – from 58 to 74, i.e. by 27.6%. In 2004 and 2005, sulphur increased the cysteine and methionine content in wheat grain. Although sulphur application in many cases decreased the protein and wet gluten contents in wheat grain, it improved the biological quality of protein because the concentrations of above-mentioned amino acids recalculated on their concentrations in protein increased significantly. The sulphur application in pseudopodzolic soil had a weaker effect on the grain quality than in break-stony soil.",

However, while CO2 fixation by phototrophic bacteria is relatively well studied, little is known about microbial CO2 fixation without light by chemoautotrophic bacteria in grassland soils. Therefore, in this study, the isotope 14C-CO2 was used to investigate the CO2-fixing process in grassland soils. Soil samples were collected from both fenced and adjacent continuous grazing grassland sites in Inner Mongolia and then incubated for 120 days under dark conditions. Meanwhile, the cbbL genes (red- and green-like) were analyzed to isolate chemoautotrophic bacteria, which are responsible for CO2 fixation. After incubation, 14C was fixed into soil organic carbon (14C-SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (14C-MBC) were found in both the fenced and grazing soils, and the fixation rate of 14C-SOC in the fenced soils (48.55‰) was significantly higher than in the grazing soils (22.11‰). The fixation rate of 14C-MBC in the fenced soils (14.05‰) was higher than in the grazing soils (7.08‰), but the difference was not significant. The red-like cbbL genes could be detected in all the soil samples, but the green-like cbbL genes could not be amplified. A greater number of identified operational taxonomic units were observed in the fenced soils compared with the grazing soils. The chemoautotrophic bacteria were mainly affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. However, Chloroflexi was detected in only the fenced soils. The results suggested that CO2 fixation by chemoautotrophic bacteria might be significant in carbon cycling in grassland.",

In this study, the concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr),copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) in 148 soil samples collected from green spaces in Beijing City, China were measured. The mean concentrations were 7.60, 0.29, 50.32, 31.61, 1.53, 23.89, 29.68, and 76.53 mg/kg, respectively. With the exception of Ni, the concentrations of the seven other heavy metals were greater than their background values. Additionally, the concentration of Hg was 3.06 times greater than the Grade 2 value (0.5 mg/kg) of Environmental quality standard for soils in China (GB 15618-1995), also exceeded the limit value (1–1.5 mg/kg) for Hg in soil of European Union (86/278/EEC). Soil pollution assessment was carried out using the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), the value of Cd and Hg were 0.70 and 4.11, respectively. It suggested that, the green space soil of Beijing was slightly polluted by Cd and seriously polluted by Hg, which posed great harm to public health. A positive correlation exists between Cu and Hg, Pb, and Zn, as well as between Hg and Pb, suggesting the metals in the green space soils originated from similar sources. Multivariate statistical analysis, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA), were adopted to identify heavy metal sources. The results suggest that the sources of heavy metals in Beijing green space soils differ. Cd, Cu, Hg, and Zn derived from vehicular transport; Cd and Cr originated from industrial activities and phosphate fertilisers; As and Ni mainly contributed by parent materials. The spatial distribution characteristics of the eight heavy metals varied greatly, and the presence of these metals was strongly associated with anthropogenic activities.",

A national survey conducted in 2012 identified deficiencies of vitamin A, Fe, and Zn among other nutrients in South Africans and regarded the deficiencies of vitamin A and Fe as a moderate but not Zn. This review discusses causes of Zn prevalence in low-income South Africans and that it is largely caused by the low content of Zn in their diets. Initiatives to reduce Zn deficiency include fortification of wheat products and maize meal which has failed to address it successfully. Weaknesses of fortification include high cost of fortified food products to low-income populations, poor regulation in ensuring compliance in fortification, non-fortification of sorghum meal, and leaching of fortified nutrients during processing. This review suggests Zn-biofortification of locally-preferred common bean cultivars as an alternative strategy to compliment fortification. The review also discusses advantages of adopting biofortified Nutritional Andean common beans. Furthermore, the review suggests initiatives including evaluation of the common bean genotypes' adaptation to different agro-ecologies.",

    "abstract": "Land drainage in Sweden has been regulated in various laws since the Middle Ages. The lowering of lake surfaces and the ditching of wetlands has been considered a valuable task to gain cultivable land, and more recently, to promote forest growth. However, in recent years the debate surrounding drainage in forests has been a matter of considerable discussion. The dry and hot summer of 2018 has awakened new views on the subject. Monitoring has shown an exceptionally low groundwater levels countrywide. Especially the islands of Öland and Gotland have faced groundwater shortages and the groundwater levels are still low in both small and large aquifers. Drainage within forest land has lacked any scientific basis until rather recently. Still, it has been a supported activity during the twentieth century. However, this has gradually as knowledge on the activity has increased and the ecology of downstream water bodies has been considered. Today, only the rinsing of existing drainage is actively practised, and it is surrounded by a number of recommendations which are still under discussion.",

The present study aimed to increase knowledge on development of stolons and rhizomes in fertile ('LaPaloma' and 'Yukon') and sterile ('Patriot' and 'Tifway') cultivars of bermudagrass. A plot trial was established in May 2013 in Legnaro, northeastern Italy. Fertile cultivars were seeded while sterile cultivars were established by vegetative plugs. Turf samples were collected from autumn 2013 until summer 2015 on March, July, and October. Total length of stolons and rhizomes was measured and total dry weight was determined. The concentration of starch in stolons and rhizomes in October was also determined. The stolon and rhizome density per unit area, the rhizome specific weight, and the rhizome/stolon length and weight ratios were calculated. Sterile cultivars had higher stolon and rhizome density compared to fertile cultivars for both length. In all cultivars, the production of stolons was favoured over that of rhizomes and rhizomes began to develop more in the second season after establishment. Cultivars did not differ significantly in starch content, indicating no relationship between stolon and rhizome density and carbohydrate reserve accumulations.Abbreviations: LD: length density per unit area; WD: weight density per unit area; SW: specific weight; LR: rhizome-to-stolon length ratio; WR: rhizome-to-stolon weight ratio; TS: total starch per unit area",

    "abstract": "Soil extractable organic nitrogen plays an important role in nitrogen transformation and migration in many ecosystems. However, it is generally ignored due to its low content in agricultural soils. The objective of this study was to evaluate the leaching risk of soil extractable organic nitrogen affected by manure application in an intensively irrigated greenhouse vegetable cropping system through investigating its spatial (vertical profile) and temporal dynamics. Results showed that extractable organic nitrogen was present in appreciable quantities, despite that nitrate was the main soluble nitrogen form in 0–60 cm soil profile. Both the extractable organic and inorganic nitrogen were enriched in the surface and subsurface soils, and showed a high temporal variability throughout the cucumber growing season. Manure application increased the stocks of extractable organic nitrogen significantly in the soil profile. Average extractable organic nitrogen reserves in 0–60 cm layer were 47, 71, and 131 kg ha−1 for the treatments of 0, 20, and 30 t dry chicken-manure application ha−1, respectively, during the cucumber growing season. As a result, while extractable organic nitrogen only accounted for a small part of total extractable nitrogen, its high contents and large temporal variation demonstrated its leaching risk in intensively irrigated vegetable cropping systems. Soil extractable organic nitrogen should be taken into account when an advanced environment management strategy is to be developed in greenhouse vegetable planting practice.",

    "abstract": "Common scab (Streptomyces spp.) is a worldwide economic important disease of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) because it degrades the appearance of the tubers and thereby decreases market value. For the newly reported Streptomyces turgidiscabies and Streptomyces europaeiscabiei in Norway, little is known about their specific environmental requirements, particularly their pathogenicity under varying moisture levels. Scab development after soil inoculation of S. turgidiscabies and S. europaeiscabiei in dry, normal and wet soils was studied in three pot experiments (2009–2011) under controlled climate conditions at natural light in Tromsø, Norway (69.7 N). With increased soil moisture, statistical significant reductions in scab severity were found in two out of three experiments for S. turgidiscabies (about 50% reduction). Similarly, scab caused by S. europaeiscabiei was reduced significantly in one experiment (65% reduction), and with a tendency of reduction in the other experiments. Scab development from seed-transmitted inoculum was investigated for both species. In one trial with four scab severity levels on mother tubers (0%, 10%, 30% and 50% of surface covered), we found that seed-transmitted disease development occurred for both species although few lesions were recorded. There were no significant differences in scab severity on progeny tubers, no matter the infection levels on seed tubers. These results indicate that seed tubers might play a minor role for transmitting common scab for S. turgidiscabies and S. europaeiscabiei, but further work is warranted. Related to growers practice, the results implicate that potato common scab caused by S. europaeiscabiei and S. turgidiscabies may be reduced by irrigation during the early stages of tuber formation, similar to currently recommended control measures for Streptomyces scabies.",

To control the disease, agronomical, chemical and biological methods are commonly applied; however, the introduction of resistance into cultivated potatoes has been considered to be the most promising approach. Therefore, in this study, the authors identified resistant breeding lines derived from somatic hybrids that were produced by protoplast fusions between Solanum brevidens and Solanum tuberosum. Initially, in vitro assay was applied to select resistant interspecific hybrids, but field assays were also performed to develop resistant breeding lines and populations. Although chromosome number and crossability were not completely recovered back to the cultivated potatoes on somatic hybrids and backcross populations, breeding lines and populations with resistance to common scab that could be used for further breeding were developed. Finally, four BC2 populations were selected and tested for resistance to the common scab and for productivity. There were variations in resistance to the common scab within each line and in productivity between lines, but the average percentages of tuber surface area with disease symptom in BC2 lines were approximately 85% and 46% less than the commercial parent controls, 'Dejiam' and 'Superior', respectively and the productivities of two populations recovered by 80–103% and 90–115% relative to 'Dejiam' and 'Superior', respectively. The results obtained in this study may contribute genetic analysis and further breeding for resistance to the common scab.",

In this research, the effects of macronutrient fertilizers on mineral contents and some biochemical contents of 'Tombul' hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) variety cultivated in the Black Sea Region of Turkey were investigated, and the contribution of these nuts to human nutrition was determined. The trials were carried out at 'Tombul' hazelnut orchards, and the hazelnuts were fertilized with five different doses of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in each year for three consecutive years. The basic fertilizers (N, P2O5, and K2O) significantly affected some biochemical contents and mineral compositions of the hazelnuts. In order to improve the biochemical and mineral compositions of hazelnut, 200 kg ha−1 and 400 kg ha−1 N fertilizations, 120 kg ha−1 and 160 kg ha−1 P2O5 fertilizations, and 400 kg ha−1 and 600 kg ha−1 K2O fertilizations could be recommended for practice. According to the daily mineral element requirements, 100 g of hazelnuts provided about 43.5% P, 13.2% K, 19.4% Ca, 37.0% Mg, 0.2% Na, 53.8% Fe, 24.5% Zn, 14.5% B, and 66.7% Mo of the recommended dietary allowances. Cu and Mn contents of 100 g hazelnut were higher than the respective daily requirements. These results indicated that the mineral composition of hazelnut depended not only on the variety but also on the cultivation techniques such as soil condition and especially basic fertilization practices.",

Flavonoids were extracted from sprouted pea seeds, and Nod factors were isolated from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae strain GR09. Pea seeds were soaked with flavonoids (F), Nod factors (Nod), mixture of both compounds (F + Nod) or water (control, C) and then planted. Enzyme activities (dehydrogenases, protease and acid phosphatase), the numbers of cultivable fungi, bacteria, Pseudomonas and Bacillus were determined in pea rhizosphere. Generally, a significant increase was observed in dehydrogenases and protease activities, bacteria, Pseudomonas and Bacillus numbers under F, Nod and F + Nod treatments compared to control and decrease in fungi number. The effect of F and Nod factors was significant for most of the microbial parameters analysed. Significant interactions between F and Nod factors for a number of fungi and Pseudomonas population were found.

(Brassicaceae), is one of the three cultivated rocket species, the demand and production of which have recently increased in Mediterranean countries where irrigation water is scarce. Besides its use as a crop, D. tenuifolia has been observed to flower for a long period and to be attractive to pollinators. In this study we assessed the effect of drought stress and moderate- and severe-deficit irrigation on growth, flower development, and attractiveness to pollinators in D. tenuifolia. The results showed that in greenhouse conditions, potted D. tenuifolia could be without irrigation for 4 days without affecting its growth, flowering, and attractiveness to pollinators. However, lack of irrigation for 8 days or longer significantly reduced the vegetative growth, number of open flowers, total floral area, flower diameter, corolla tube diameter, and corolla tube length of D. tenuifolia. This study shows that regulated-deficit irrigation can improve water use efficiency, and depending on the purpose of growing D. tenuifolia, as a crop or as a beneficial plant to attract pollinators, it can reduce water consumption from 40% to 70% without affecting its vegetative and floral development and without reducing its attractiveness to pollinators.",

In the Loess Plateau regions, the annual precipitation is low and varies annually and seasonally, with more than 60% concentrated in the summer months from July to September, which is the summer fallow period in the winter wheat-summer fallow cropping system. With bare fallow in summer as a control, a 3-year location-fixed field experiment was conducted in the Loess Plateau to investigate the effects of wheat straw retention (SR), green manure (GM) planting, and their combination on soil water retention (WR) during summer fallow, winter wheat yield, and crop water use and nitrogen (N) uptake. The results showed that SR increased soil WR during summer fallow by 20 mm on average compared with the control over 3 experimental years but reduced the grain yield by 8% in the third year and the grain N content by 6–15% in all 3 years. In contrast, GM planting markedly reduced soil WR by 16 mm and 33 mm in the first and third year, respectively, but increased water use efficiency (WUE) by 16% in the third year and nitrate N accumulation in 0–100 cm soil at winter wheat sowing. Their combination did not significantly affect the soil WR or the soil nitrate N content in any of the 3 years, but did increase WUE by 11% in the third year and grain yield by 2.6% in the second year. In conclusion, the combination of SR and GM planting mitigated the negative effects of the individual measures, providing a feasible method for summer fallow management in the semiarid Loess Plateau in China and other similar regions.",

Various warning and forecast systems have been developed in different countries (in Latvia – under the framework of Danish-Baltic joint project 'Development and Implementation of an Internet-based Decision Support System for Integrated Pest Management'), but results were contradictory. The aim of this investigation was to identify the possibilities for integrated disease control under intensive management of winter wheat. Different schemes of fungicide treatment, including a decision support system, were tested in field trials from 2008 to 2012 in two places. Leaf blotches caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Zymoseptoria tritici are recognised as the most harmful wheat diseases in Latvia. The total impact of diseases, which was calculated as area under disease progress curves, was affected by the year and the scheme of fungicide treatment. Significantly higher yields were obtained in treatments with fungicide application, but differences between control strategies were not significant. The obtained results confirmed that two fungicide applications are not necessary (except certain cases). The results suggest that recommendations should be based on the disease incidence on the third or second leaf of wheat.",

This study combined results from a climate chamber experiment involving 41 spring wheat varieties and a field experiment involving six winter and six spring wheat varieties grown with and without the application of mineral N fertiliser. The climate chamber experiment was analysed by partial least squares (PLS) regression, with several predictors and NUE as response, to identify traits related to NUE. Specific hypotheses were then tested in the field experiment. The PLS indicated six traits of particular importance for overall NUE: leaf chlorophyll (SPAD value) of the top leaf at stem elongation, grains ear−1, ears pot−1, straw biomass pot−1, days between emergence and anthesis, and days between emergence and completed senescence. In the field experiment, the SPAD value of flag leaves of winter wheat around anthesis was positively correlated with NUE and total grain N, at both N levels. Fast development was positively correlated with high NUE and N uptake efficiency in spring wheat. Early senescence of the flag leaf was positively correlated with grain N concentration and negatively correlated with grain-specific N efficiency in winter wheat at low N fertilisation levels. The results indicate that high SPAD value of the top leaf might be a candidate trait that could be used in wheat breeding for improved NUE, while genetic variation in senescence could possibly be used to tailor varieties for different end-use quality when grown at low N. More studies are needed to validate these findings in other environments and for other genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of soil transformations and degradation is important not only for agriculture, but also for fundamental research on identification of new features for classification. In 1999, new Lithuanian soil classification (LTDK-99) was developed by adopting the diagnostic principles of WRB 1998. Together with new knowledge, it highlighted some relevant soil research and classification problems. Not only new terms but also diagnostic features of several newly distinguished first-level soils groups are being discussed, especially for the identification of cambisols, planosols, arenosols, and regosols. Additionally, a group of stagnosols is suggested for inclusion into this classification. The presence of glaciogenic secondary clay minerals in Lithuanian cambisols does not imply unambiguous brownification involvement, neither any study shows cambisols having specific to brownification iron minerals. The intensively occurring lesive in these soils questions correctness of identification of cambisols additionally aggravated by strong and deep anthropogenization of the soil profiles within the territorial range. Complex glaciogenesis makes it difficult to identify Lithuanian planosols. WRB 2014 (update 2015) identifies planosols according to the pedogenesis in old, strongly weathered binomial deposits using examples mostly from South American, South and East African plateaus of the subtropical zone. The same classification assigns planosols identified in Lithuania to stagnosols, that is, to the soils characterized by binomial genesis and stagnification. The diagnostic features of arenosols and regosols are similar in both groups and are related to primitive pedogenesis. Difficulties in distinguishing between the two groups in Lithuania are strengthened by the intensive cultivation of the ecosystems in their territorial range. The existing problems in Lithuanian soil diagnostics underline the questions of soil classification in general, especially regarding the evolution tendencies in soil classification. The article draws attention to the soil diagnostic aspects like distribution and genesis of clay particles, genesis of territory, and anthropogenic transformation for the improvement of soil identification.",

This study used diallel mating design to elucidate general combining ability and specific combining ability, to determine the gene action controlling storage root dry matter, starch and sugar content in sweetpotato and the heterotic potential of the traits to facilitate the crop’s improvement for increased utilisation. A general model for estimating genetic effects, GEAN II, was used to analyse the data. Genetic variability was seen for dry matter, starch and sugar content of sweetpotato and much of this genetic variation was additive in nature. The study also revealed significant heterosis in sweetpotato which offers opportunity for breeding non-sweet, high dry matter sweetpotato varieties that are preferred by farmers and consumers in Ghana.",

The objectives of this study were to assess the level of phenotypic diversity present among sweetpotato varieties grown in Rwanda, and to select suitable parents for breeding DPSVs. Fifty-one diverse sweetpotato genotypes were evaluated in field trials conducted at the Rubona and Karama experimental stations of the Rwanda Agriculture Board using a 6 × 9 unbalanced alpha lattice design with three replications. Genotypes and sites showed significant interaction (P < .05), indicating differential response of genotypes in fresh root yield (FRY), root dry matter content, dry root yield (DRY), marketable root number, marketable root weight, flowering frequency and harvest index. The top two genotypes selected for their high FRY were RW11-4923 (20.9 t ha−1) and RW11-2419 (20.18 t ha−1). RW11-4923 and Wagabolige were the best performers for vine yield, producing 23.67 and 23.45 t ha−1 of vines, respectively. Ukerewe performed well for its DRY (7.09 t ha−1), while RW11-4923 had the highest mean dry vine yield (5.17 t ha−1). RW11-2910 and 8-1038 had root-to-vine ratios of 2.0 and 1.5, respectively, suggesting their suitability as breeding parents, to breed DPSVs. Two main phenotypic groups with 10 sub-groups were detected through cluster analysis. Principal component analysis showed that the first four components accounted for 76.33% of the phenotypic variation present among the 51 genotypes.

    "abstract": "Unsuitable soil management in agriculture is known to results in the deterioration of soil health and the decline of biodiversity. The experiment tested whether no-tillage with mulch (NT), could boost biological activity of soil macrofauna population in continuous maize monocropping system compared with rotational tillage with mulch (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). Soil macrofauna was sampled at the end of the 2014/2015 growing season using 25 × 25 × 25 cm steel monoliths. The mean density of individual orders was higher (p < 0.001) under NT (46%) and RT (38%) compared with CT (16%). However, the Shannon-Weaver index revealed that the diversity and evenness of orders were similar for all treatments. Macrofauna patterns revealed that NT and RT contained higher (p < 0.001) population of Isoptera and Diplopoda. Isoptera was 51% and 17% higher in NT than CT and RT, while in Diplopoda, NT was 39% and 2% higher than CT and RT, respectively. It was concluded that NT and RT systems favoured the development of macrofauna communities in the studied maize continuous monoculture cropping system but did not favour order diversity of macrofauna. This suggests the importance of crop rotation for the development of the more diverse macrofaunal population.",

Considering that, the maize is extremely sensitive to micronutrient deficiency the main aim of this study was to asses: (1) micronutrient availability in soil, (2) micronutrient status in silage maize; and (3) the relationship between micronutrient soil availability and maize plant concentration. Soil samples for micronutrient availability (n = 112) were collected from 28 farms in 7 municipalities. Plant available micro- and macro- nutrients in soil were extracted using Mehlich-3, except plant available Se was extracted using 0.1M KH2PO4. Result showed that on average there was no significant difference between different soil types regarding their potential in plant available nutrients. P deficiency was present both, in soil and plants in whole region. Soil extractable P was ranging from 0.003–0.13 g kg−1 and total plant P was ranging from 0.79–4.95 g kg−1. Zinc deficiency was observed in two locations both in soil (0.71 mg kg−1; 0.79 mg kg−1) and plant (11.5 mg kg−1; 15.8 mg kg−1). Potential Se soil deficiency was observed on some locations, while Se plant status is not high enough to meet daily requirements of farm animals. Extractable soil nutrients could be used as relatively good predictor of potential soil and plant deficiencies, but soil nutrient interactions and climate conditions are highly effecting the plant uptake potential.",

Therefore, the prescribe study was conducted using Line × Tester design to determine combining abilities, and about the maternal-and-paternal gene actions involved in achene yield and seed quality traits in 21 single cross hybrids. Significant mean differences for achene yield and seed quality traits were observed, with total attributed variation (R2 = 0.89). Principal component analysis (P < 0.05) explained 92.6% variation and using factor analysis, we found factor 1 had primary variables (AW, AL, AT, HD, PH, PC, LA and OC) contributed 35.6% variation to achene yield. Combining ability analysis showed the positive general combining ability for E%, HD, PH, 100 AW and AYP in parental inbred lines, whilst, hybrids had positive specific combining ability for E%, HD, PH, 100 AW, DTF, DTM, OA, LA, OC and AYP. Females contributed significantly higher (P < 0.05) for AYP, E%, HD, NWPH, PH, 100 AW, LA and OA than that of males. Two-way hierarchical clustering showed the most promising hybrid H5 (A-18 × G-79) in Cluster V. The hybrid H5 also showed heterosis, heterobeltosis and commercial heterosis, therefore, genetic exploitation of H5 is highly desirable in future breeding to map QTLs/genes in arid/semi-arid zones and /or similar growing conditions to boost up yield and seed quality traits.",

The use of Striga resistant varieties is an economical and environmentally friendly option that can be easily adopted by smallholder farmers. Uptake of newly developed varieties would be high if the breeding process is inclusive and consultative to farmer preferred traits and preferences. The aim of this study was to identify farmers' maize production constraints, current Striga control options, trait preference and perceptions among smallholder farmers in western Tanzania. Surveys were conducted in four districts, namely Igunga, Shinyanga rural, Urambo and Uyui during the 2017/2018 cropping season. Data were collected from 324 farmers using a semi-structured questionnaire (166), focus group discussions (158) and field observations. The major maize production constraints reported by farmers were; drought (97.2%), Striga infestation (93.1%), insect pests in field (90.1%) and in stores (72.7%). The main Striga control options described by farmers across the studied districts were: hoe weeding, uprooting, manure application and crop rotation in descending order. Only 59% of the farmers used the seed of improved maize varieties of either hybrids or open-pollinated varieties (OPV) which are Striga susceptible and the remaining used home saved seed. A breeding programme aiming at improving maize varieties for Striga resistance, including farmers' preferred traits, should be designed and executed to control Striga infestations thus improving maize production, productivity and profitability in western Tanzania.",

The results showed that the soil bulk density with RTO treatment were higher than with CT and RT treatments. And the soil EC, aggregate mean weight diameter in both wet and dry sieving with NT and RT treatments were higher than that of RTO treatment. CT and RT treatments had the best soil quality and produced the highest rice yield of average 2016–2018. Removing the crop residues gave the lowest yield and less favourable soil physical and chemical characteristics compared to the application of crop residues treatments. It was found that conventional tillage and rotary tillage with crop residues retention is a feasible management technology for farmers producing rice in the double-cropping paddy field of southern China, resulting in a better soil quality and higher yield than with the conventional farmer practice.",

There were no significant differences in the concentration of total flavonoids, phenolic acids and fatty acids in the camelina seeds during the research years, but there were differences between the spring and winter cultivars. The total concentration of flavonoids in the spring forms amounted from 404 ± 38.5 to 429.9 ± 13.8 mg/kg; in the winter ones from 507.3 ± 51.4 to 526.4 ± 10.4 mg/kg.

The effects of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation given by UV-B tubes (Q-panel UV 313) and by standard cool white fluorescent tubes (Philips Master TL-D 36W/840) on flavonol and anthocyanin synthesis in lettuce cv. Lollo Rosso (Carmoli) were studied. The aim was to increase the content of flavonoids without reducing the fresh weight of the plant. Cool white fluorescent tubes induced high amounts of flavonoids in the plants during a five-day experimental period, with no growth reduction. The highest doses of UV-B from the UV-B tubes resulted in higher flavonoid synthesis, but with some growth reduction. The increase in flavonoids was highest in the first two to three days. The kinetics of flavonoid accumulation were measured with the chlorophyll fluorescence excitation ratio (FER) method using a portable multiple wavelength fluorometer. The accumulation of flavonoids can be rapidly and frequently measured with this non-destructive FER method. The FER method can easily be used by cultivators to get an estimate of the flavonol and anthocyanin content that may contribute to the nutritional value and marketability.",

Significance of boron (B) in nutrient management studies has been increasingly underlined under intensive cropping systems particularly in acid soils. In order to understand the distribution of soil native B in different fractions and their contribution to plant B uptake as influenced by nutrient management, soil samples collected after wheat (2009–2010) from a long-term experiment (LTE) continuing since 1972–1973 on Typic Paleustalf of Ranchi were subjected to sequential fractionation of soil B. Treatments included N alone, NP, NPK, 150% of recommended NPK, NPK + farmyard manure (FYM), NPK + lime, and an unfertilized-control. Five soil B fractions were determined along with hot CaCl2-extractable (available) B. Averaged across the treatments, the soil had low organic carbon (C), pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC), and high free sesquioxides. Total B content was 21.7 mg kg−1. Among different B fractions, residual B was the major contributor to total B and other fractions collectively shared 7% of total B only. Application of N alone depleted readily soluble, specifically adsorbed and organically bound B bringing the contents even below unfertilized-control. Conjoint use of lime or FYM with NPK increased significantly these fractions, whereas a decrease in oxide bound B was noticed under these treatments. Available B was positively correlated with these fractions indicating their significance in controlling B availability in the soil. The study revealed that use of lime or FYM helped modifying the distribution of soil B in different fractions by way of changing soil pH and organic C content, resulting in enrichment of plant available pool. A drastically low available B content in different treatments receiving fertilizers alone, however, suggested the necessity of B fertilization at prescribed rates for maintaining soil B fertility as also high crop yields.",

Therefore, a pot experiment was conducted to contribute to the development of alternative compound fertilisers with balanced nutrient ratios for cereal production. We compared the (1) fertilisation effects and (2) effects on soil chemistry of four organic nitrogen (N)- and phosphorous (P)-rich waste-based products (WBPs), applied with or without potassium (K)-rich bottom wood ash (BWA). WBPs and BWA were applied at two rates (80 kg N ha−1 + 35 kg K ha−1 and 160 kg N ha−1 + 70 kg K ha−1) to spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) in year one and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) in year two, and the effects were compared with those of commercial mineral and organic compound fertilisers. The K fertilisation effects of BWA were masked by the soil's ability to provide plant-available K during both years of the experiment. Plant-available N was, therefore, the growth-limiting factor for barley in year one, when there were no differences in grain yield between treatments with and without K-rich BWA. The mineral fertiliser equivalent of WBPs was 64–118% for N uptake in barley grain, but can be expected to be lower under field conditions. During year two, wheat yield was determined by the plant availability of P and N. Meat-rich meat and bone meal caused P deficiency at the lower application rate as a result of alkaline soil conditions, whereas the P in BWA appeared to be almost as plant-available as soluble mineral P.",

Analysis of the underlying variables was done based on a multivariate data analysis strategy. The strategy successfully divided the clones into WUEi performance categories. Differences between clonal WUEi responses were traced back to differences in the net photosynthetic rate. Stomatal conductance (gs) did not vary significantly between the clones. Leaf abscisic acid (ABA) concentration and leaf water potential were found to reflect known isohydric behaviour for potato, and a non-linear relationship could be established for gs and leaf ABA concentration across the WUEi groups. Similarly, a common non-linear relationship between leaf ABA concentration and soil water potential was found. The latter findings suggest that the investigated population did not harbour significant genetic variation as to ABA production as function of soil desiccation level or with respect to the sensitivity of stomatal aperture vis-à-vis leaf ABA concentration and soil water potential.",

    "abstract": "Six potato cultivars grown in Turkey in boron-prone areas and differing in their tolerance towards high boron were studied to reveal whether boron causes oxidative stress. To assess stress level, chlorophyll fluorescence and growth parameters were measured. Oxidative damage was assessed as malondialdehyde level, and antioxidant protection was evaluated as ascorbate (AA), dehydroascorbate, reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione amounts and superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities. High boron stress affected photosynthesis negatively in a threshold-dependent manner and inhibited growth. No pronounced changes in oxidation of lipids occurred in any cultivar. Activation of APX suggested the involvement of an ascorbic acid–reduced glutathione cycle in the protection against oxidative stress caused by high boron. Efficient work of this antioxidant system was probably hindered by boron complexation with NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H and resulted in the inhibition of GR and a decrease in AA and GSH. Hence, oxidative stress associated with high boron is a secondary component of boron toxicity which arises from metabolic changes caused by boron interference with major metabolites. Potato cultivars tolerate excess boron stress well and show damage only in very high boron concentrations. The potato cvs best suited for high boron soils/breeding purposes are cvs Van Gogh and Agria.Abbreviations: AA: ascorbic acid; APX: ascorbate peroxidase; CAT: catalase; DHA: dehydroascorbic acid; DHAR: dehydroascorbate reductase; DTNB: 5; 5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid; DTT: dithiotreitol; Fv/Fm: photosynthetic efficiency at the dark-adapted state; GR: glutathione reductase; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSSG: oxidized glutathione; MDA: malondialdehyde; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SOD: superoxide dismutase; TCA: trichloroacetic acid",

    "abstract": "Mycorrhizal symbiosis is the one of the most important relationship between microbiota and plants to sustain plant nutrition in relatively unfavourable conditions. Somehow this relation is threatened by time, therefore, definition of the factors effecting mycorrhizal symbiosis has become essential. The aim of this study was to determine the differences in specific mycorrhizal parameters such as sporulation and soil–plant environment conditions in three different regions of Turkey. During 1996−2002, 53 soil series were selected from natural and agricultural plant communities in three different agro-ecological zones of Turkey: Central Anatolia (CA), the Southeastern Anatolian (SA) project area and the Coast of Mediterranean (CM). The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), spore numbers and mycorrhizal root colonization were related to the annual average precipitation, soil characteristics and host plant identity.In the CM zone (average annual precipitation of 650 mm), soils found under natural vegetation contained a maximum value of 108 spores g−1, with bare soils containing a minimum number of 0.1 spores g−1. In the CA zone (330 mm annual average precipitation), the maximum number of spores in the soil samples was 46.5 spores g−1 with a minimum of 6.8 spores g−1 and in the SA soil samples (380 mm annual average precipitation), a maximum of 48.4 spores g−1 and a minimum of 14.2 spores g−1 were recorded. The overall mean number of mycorrhizal spores g−1 soil was 15.5 ± 14.4, 22.2 ± 8.6 and 27.9 ± 25.4 for the CA, SA and CM zones, respectively. Mean spore numbers differed in only two of the three zones, with the third zone being intermediate. Precipitation was the most affecting factor on the sporulation of AMF. Also host plant species and certain soil parameters, such as positive correlations with CaCO3 and N-min and a negative correlation with organic matter, have an influence on sporulation.The key finding is that the cropping system has a large impact on spore numbers/abundance. Seventeen standing crops as well as bare soil, fallow and natural areas were compared. There are a large number of factors which can affect mycorrhizal development; in the present work, it seems that soil and crop management, and environmental factors (such as precipitation) affect sporulation and root colonization. Covering land surface with mycorrhiza-dependent cover crop, irrigation and less soil till may increase indigenous mycorrhizal spores.",

    "abstract": "Soil erosion is a major land degradation problem in South Africa (SA) that has economic, social and environmental implications due to both on-site and off-site effects. High rates of soil erosion by water are causing rapid sedimentation of water bodies, ultimately leading to water crisis in SA. Lots of financial and human resources are channelled towards controlling of soil erosion but unfortunately with little success. The level of soil erosion in a particular area is governed by the site properties. Therefore, it is inappropriate to generalize data on soil erosion at a large-scale spatial context. The literature on soil erosion in SA classifies Eastern Cape Province as a high-erosion-potential area using data collected at a large-scale spatial context. Collecting soil erosion data at a large spatial scale ignores site-specific properties that could influence soil erosion and has resulted in failure of many traditional soil erosion control measures applied in the province. Moreover, scientific principles underlying the processes and mechanisms of soil erosion in highly erodible soils are missing in SA. This review was to find effective soil erosion control measures by having an insight on what happens during soil erosion and how soil erosion occurs in Ntabelanga. The literature suggested that erosion in Ntabelanga could be influenced by both the erosivity and erodibility factors though the erodibility factors being more influential. Soil permeability contrast between the horizons could be influencing the rate and nature of soil erosion. To mitigate the impact of soil erosion in Ntabelanga, efforts should aim to improve the vertical flow capacity in the B horizon. Clay spreading, clay delving, addition of gypsum, deep ploughing and mulching could aid the water permeability problems of the subsurface horizons. However for effective soil management and control option, detailed studies of specific site properties are needed. The generated information can assist in formulating soil erosion policies and erosion control strategies in the Ntabelanga area and SA at large.",

    "abstract": "The use of plastic mulch is associated with a higher increase in yield of vegetables. However, at the end of the growing season for each crop, plastic mulching can create environmental pollution that can cause negative impacts on the environment that could be solved by the use of degradable plastics. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oxo-degradable plastic mulches on soil temperature, growth, gas exchange, and cucumber crop yield. The study was conducted in two locations in the northeast of Mexico during the spring and summer of 2013. The plastic mulch colors with additives were blue, green, and red and each color having 8% and 12% of pigment and 22% and 23% of Titanium dioxide (Rutile). The resultant treatments were compared with the black plastic mulch, which is the standard plastic in the world, and bare soil in a randomized complete block design with three replications in two locations. The mean soil temperature at both locations was statistically higher in black plastic mulch, followed by the oxo-degradable plastics mulches and lowest in the control. Gas exchange was not affected by plastic mulches. SPAD units as the index of chlorophyll content in leaves were very little affected by plastic mulch. Both, commercial and total yield were statistically similar in the oxo-degradable plastic mulches and the black plastic mulch, and lowest in the control. Plastics with higher concentrations of pigment registered higher degradation in both locations. Our results suggest that different plastic mulches impact positively on the yield of cucumber crop. The benefit in yield by the different plastic mulches in the conditions of this study was due to their soil warming ability that results in improved soil temperature, leaf area, and plant dry weight.",

    "abstract": "Four field trials (spring wheat and oats) were conducted (one on clay soil, one on loam soil and two on silt soil) for three years in important cereal growing districts, to investigate the influence of tillage regimes (ploughing versus reduced tillage in either autumn or spring) and straw management (removed and retained) on plant residue amounts, weed populations, soil structural parameters and cereal yields. The effect of tillage on soil structure varied, mainly due to the short trial period. In general, the amount of small soil aggregates increased with tillage intensity. Reduced soil tillage, and in some cases spring ploughing, gave significantly higher aggregate stability than autumn ploughing, thus providing protection against erosion. However, decreasing tillage intensity increased the amounts of weeds, particularly of Poa annua on silt soil. Straw treatment only slightly affected yields, while effects of tillage varied between both year and location. Reduced tillage, compared to ploughing, gave only small yield differences on loam soil, while it was superior on clay soil and inferior on silt soil. Our results suggest that shallow spring ploughing is a good alternative to autumn ploughing, since it gave comparable yields, better protection against erosion and was nearly as effective against weeds.",

In this study, whether acidic compost tea (CT) could increase the available P in calcareous soil was evaluated through a pot experiment. The P forms of the samples were analysed using Hedley sequential P fractionation. CT had significant effects on different soil P fractions and P uptake (p < 0.05). Compared with organic fertiliser (OF), acidic CT increased the availability of H2O-P and NaHCO3-P by 15.9% and 12.6%, respectively, it mainly comes from the dissolution of HCl-P and residue-P. CT also promoted the growth and yield of cotton and significantly increased P use efficiency by 13.8% and 31.6% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared with OF, because the H+ in CT reduced the pH of the calcareous soil, promoted the dissolution of stable P in soil, and reduced the fixation of P from the fertiliser. However, the organic matter in CT did not contribute much to the desorption of P. These findings provide a new idea for the activation and utilisation of P in calcareous soil.",

    "abstract": "Mineral fertilisers differ in changing soil properties, and revealing how the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere respond could provide a robust assessment of fertiliser regimes. Rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils were sampled from five fertilisation treatments in a long-term (24 year) experiment. Enzyme activities and total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) content in the rhizosphere soil were 85.8% and 51.3% higher than in the non-rhizosphere soil, respectively. Fertilisation increased enzyme activities, especially the N-cycling enzyme β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase in NP fertilised soil (1.5 and 2.5 times for rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil, respectively). The PLFA composition indicated that fungi dominated in the rhizosphere fertilised with P, whereas bacteria were more common in the non-rhizosphere soil. The PLFA contents and enzyme activities in the rhizosphere of P-fertilised plants were lower than those in the non-rhizosphere soil because P availability was lower in the rhizosphere. The redundancy analysis showed that the microbial community in the rhizosphere soil was different from that of the non-rhizosphere soil, mainly because there were differences in the 15:1ω6c and 16:0. Long-term (24 year) fertilisation strongly increased nutrient contents, and microbial biomass and activity in paddy soil. It is advisable to apply P fertiliser in the root zone to increase fertiliser use efficiency.",

A total of 74 geo-referenced composite surface (0-30 cm) soil samples were collected from representative farm lands. Soil chemical properties were analyzed following standard procedures. In addition, semi-variogram model was applied to estimate the spatial variability of soil properties. The results showed that soil chemical properties are below their threshold values in all agroecosystems and soil groups. The value of soil pH ranged from 4.3 to 6.8; Exchangeable acidity ranged from 0.124 to 0.180 cmol (+) kg−1; EC ranged from 0.02 to 0.19 dS m−1; OC ranged from 0.7 to 3.8%; TN ranged from 0.11 to 0.27%; Exchangeable potassium from 0.29 to 2.0 cmol (+) kg−1and CEC from 22 to 56 cmol (+)kg−1. The results also revealed that soil pH, exchangeable acidity, electrical conductivity, and exchangeable potassium showed strong spatial dependence whereas SOC and TN had moderate spatial dependence. The results indicated that soil quality is deteriorating. Hence, crop, soil and site-specific soil management strategies, primarily focusing on improving the content of SOM and addressing the problems of soil acidity are suggested to improve the soil conditions.",

A total of 7 onion genotypes were exposed to constant temperature of 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45°C under in vitro and grown under increasing temperature from March to May to study the impact of high temperature on morphological traits and bulb yield. The genotypes responded differently and high temperature led to decline in germination (%), survival days, seedling length and weight. Sel. 140 exhibited less decline compared to other genotypes. The drastic reduction of germination percentage was recorded at higher temperature of 40 and 45°C. The highest seedling vigour index of 2062 was exhibited by Sel. 140. The highest germination (%) was recorded in March sowing in genotype Sel. 140 (90.3) and least in May sowing in genotype Sel. 417 (65.3). High temperature resulted in a significant reduction in vegetative growth traits and yield traits. Agrifound Dark Red and Sel. 140 were found promising for high temperature tolerance. The high amount of variability suggests scope for improvement and gradual genetic drift is possible to develop onion varieties suitable for high temperature condition.",

    "abstract": "How much does weed biomass increase if one abstains weed control in a single year, and would that increase involve weed species that may be beneficial to pollinating insects? To answer these questions, data on weed biomass were analysed from untreated and chemically treated plots in nearly 2000 field experiments conducted in spring- and autumn-sown cereal crops in Sweden. About 50% of the weed biomass was of the 30 species classified as 'pollinator friendly' based on the amounts of pollen and/or nectar produced. Increases were slightly larger in autumn- than spring-sown crops. The increase in biomass varied somewhat geographically and due to soil type, while type of crop seemed less important. Most important for the increase was the overall abundance of weeds in a field. We conclude that applying a single-year no-treatment strategy would be most suited in fields with relatively low weed abundance. Considering the low cost, potential acreage covered and assumed biodiversity benefit, such a strategy might be a preferable environmental mitigation method. To further evaluate this potential mitigation methods, data on biodiversity and pollinator visits to weed flowers within arable fields would be welcome, as well as potential side effects, like weed control challenges in following years.",

After two growth seasons CO2 enrichment enhanced RGR and total plant dry weight by 11 and 35% in Picea abies and by 12 and 36% in Pinus sylvestris, respectively. Elevated CO2 decreased the shoot:root ratio in Larix leptolepis, and decreased the needlerstem ratio in Picea glauca, but increased it in Pseudotsuga menziesii. Elevated O3 significantly decreased the plant dry weight in Picea sitchensis, Pseudotsuga menziesii and in one of three provenances of Pinus sylvestris, while the other species and provenances were unaffected.

Emissions of NH 3 , N 2 O and CH 4 from deep litter compost were measured using a dynamic chamber over a period of 57 days from 2 July to 26 August 1997. High concentrations of N 2 O inside the compost heap were found initially and after 20 days of composting. Methane concentrations in the heap were high during days 8-15. As a result of NH 3 volatilization, 2.2 kg NH 3 -N t -1 (23% of total N) was lost in the first 5 days. Emissions of N 2 O amounted to 0.22% of the total N present at the start of the experiment and CH 4 emission represented 0.01% of total C. In this experiment no leaching occurred, and thus non-volatile nutrients were conserved during composting. The population of nitrifying bacteria remained low throughout the experiment (around 105 cells g -1 dry matter) and the density of denitrifying bacteria stayed high (4.2 2 107 cells g -1 dry matter).

Four instruments, Instron, Texture Analyser, penetrometer PNR10 (SUR Berlin) and Bareiss HHP-2001-Fff, were tested. In addition \"Eisenhuth's method\" was tried, which involves putting the fruits into a cylinder, placing a load on the top and measuring the compression. Eisenhuth's method was found to be cheap, time-saving and easy to use, and is a promising method for firmness testing of strawberries. Bareiss is a small instrument, which was found to be easy and quick to use, and gave reliable results. The results were easily transmitted to a personal computer. Instron and Texture Analyser are good and advanced instruments with reliable results, but they are expensive, complicated and time-consuming. The PNR10 is quite easy to use but time-consuming, and the results showed large variations. Relatively large natural variability in strawberry firmness was found; therefore, the sample size should be at least 25 fruits. Strawberry fruit firmness was tested in 18 cultivars by two methods. Considerable cultivar differences were found and the ranking of the cultivars was different by the two methods. Large variations in fruit firmness and in soluble solids between individual fruits within samples were observed, especially for cv. 'Korona'. The correlations between firmness and soluble solids content were not significant. Small fruits tended to be firmer than large ones. Ripe fruits were softer than pink ones, but the difference was reduced during storage. The fruits were softer when the internal fruit temperature was 20°;C than at lower temperatures. Fruit colour measured by a Minolta Colorimeter showed smaller variations than in firmness and soluble solids. Only low correlations between colour and other fruit characteristics were found.

An additional objective was to determine whether alternative legume species to those in common use (T. subterraneum and M. polymorpha) in the area, could improve BNF. The field studies were conducted in two edaphic conditions, granitic (Entisol) and clay (Vertisol) soil, located in Cauquenes, VII Region, in the sub-humid Mediterranean zone of Chile. In the granitic soil the percentages of N derived from fixation were high in all species (74 to 94%); yellow serradela cv. Tauro presented the greatest N content in dry matter and N fixation, equivalent to 91 kg N ha−1. In contrast, pink serradela cv. Cádiz and subterranean clover cv. Gosse presented the lowest N fixation. In the clay soil, under periodically waterlogged conditions, balansa clover cv. Paradana and persian clover cv. Prolific had high percentage values of BNF (>95%) and fixed more N (100.2 and 82.5 kg N ha−1, respectively) than burr medic and subterranean clover cv. Gosse. The present study allowed the identification of new germplasm of high capacity of N fixation which is an additional criterion for selecting species for infertile and waterlogged soil conditions in the Mediterranean area of Chile.",

Significant differences between tillage systems were recorded on the measured properties, apart from moisture content, at 15–30 cm soil layer. The CT1, CT2 and RCT systems resulted in similar penetration resistance and bulk density values below the 15 cm soil depth, while the RT and NT systems resulted in higher but similar values. The mean penetration resistance values were less than 1 MPa in the CT1, CT2 and RCT systems at the 0–15 cm depth, while they were 1.41, 1.84 MPa in RT and NT, respectively. The mean total porosity increased with tillage from 8.2 to 28% when compared with NT. The CT1, CT2 and RCT systems resulted in lower moisture content at the 0–15 cm depth.

Rotations that included intensive cropping without pastures, and crops with short- or long-term pastures were maintained for 12 years after which soil samples were taken at 0–5 and 5–10 cm depths for analysis of the C, N and S contents in the different grades of water-stable aggregates. The mean weight diameter of the aggregates was also determined as an indicator of structural stability. The results showed that the rotations which included long-term pastures of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) or white clover (Trifolium repens L.) had higher contents of C, N and S in soil and there was a higher concentration of these elements in macro-aggregates (>0.5 mm) than in micro-aggregates (<0.5 mm). Additionally, the rotations with pastures also produced greater structural stability of the soil aggregates. Consequently, crop rotations that included pastures, particularly those of longer duration, improved the soil and were therefore a more sustainable use of the soil resource compared to the more intensive rotations. Additionally, there was evidence of hierarchical organization of the soil structure, which is a previously non-described feature of volcanic soils.",

During the period 1978–1995, a long-term field trial was conducted on highly decomposed peat soil in order to investigate the impact of adding mineral materials to improve soil characteristics and increase grass yield. Shell sand or moraine soil (200, 400 or 800 m3 ha−1) was incorporated into peat soil. Generally, addition of both shell sand and moraine soil improved the physical properties of the soil and grass production. During the first nine years, shell sand (400 m3 ha−1) was the most efficient. Thereafter, moraine soil (400 and 800 m3 ha−1) seemed most beneficial. This study indicates that additions of shell sand or moraine soil to peat are appropriate methods to improve and conserve the physical properties and cropping potential of these vulnerable soils.",

The results revealed differences in chemical parameters between the hulled and hull-less varieties, especially in carbohydrate composition. Also, variations within the types were found, which indicated that factors other than the presence or lack of hull may also influence the carbohydrate composition. As expected, varieties grown at the same location in both seasons had a lesser variation in their grain composition between the growing periods than varieties grown at different locations. Changing the growth location from Canada to Norway also gave an increase in starch and insoluble fibre, but decreased the amount of β-glucan, protein and soluble fibre. Promising varieties for the food industry are samples with an atypical starch characteristic without hull, due to higher levels of the proposed health-beneficial components.

A long-term field experiment was thus conducted to study the influence of fertilization on soil physicochemical properties, microbial biomass carbon, microbial quotient, enzyme activities, and cypermethrin dissipation. Five fertilization treatments were arranged: organic manure (OM), NPK fertilizer, PK fertilizer, NK fertilizer, and no fertilizer (control). Soil organic C, N, P contents and enzymatic activities were higher in soils with balanced fertilization as opposed to those with unbalanced fertilization, especially fertilization with organic manure. The longest half-life of cypermethrin was in the NK treatment (15.1 d), the least in the PK treatment (9.6 d). Pesticide dissipation in non-sterilized and sterilized soils showed that changes of cypermethrin persistence were caused by biodegradation. Soil N/P ratio (ratio of soil-available N to available P) and available N content positively correlated with half-life (p<0.05), and could limit cypermethrin dissipation greatly. These results indicate that in agricultural practice, oversupplying N should not be advocated. P application may be an efficient way to decrease N/P ratio and enhance cypermethrin dissipation in soil with high available N content. Based on a comprehensive consideration of soil fertility, crop yield, and environment, a mixed application of organic manure and inorganic fertilizers is recommended in the region, although balanced fertilization results in slower cypermethrin dissipation than does N-deficiency treatment.",

The growth, dry-matter (DM) production, and drought tolerance of twelve accessions of Lotus tenuis Waldst & Kit, Syn. L. glaber, naturalized in Chile were evaluated with the objective to select contrasting genotypes, tolerant and sensitive to drought, for future breeding programmes. The accessions were sown in pots of 1.3 L containing a volcanic soil (Andisol). A completely randomized design with all combinations of Lotus accessions and four water treatments [100, 70, 40, and 10% of soil water availability (SWA)] was used. The relative rate of stem elongation (RRSE), the shoots and roots DM production, the relative water content (RWC), and the specific leaf area (SLA) were measured. A drought-sensitivity index (DSI) and the interaction genotype×environment were calculated. The RRSE, the DM production, RWC, and SLA all showed a significant reduction (P<0.05) in the treatment with the higher water restriction (10% SWA). There were significant differences (P<0.05) within RRSE and DM production genotype means, but the RWC and SLA did not differ among populations. The DSI varied broadly among genotypes, from 0.49 to 1.34, and was correlated negatively with DM production under water stress (10% SWA). It was concluded that the Lotus tenuis populations showed water-stress tolerance genetic variability, with accessions Lt14 and Lt4 the most contrasting. These findings will permit us to identify chromosomal regions associated with drought-tolerant genotypes which will allow us to accelerate the development of cultivars adapted to water-restricted environments.",

The biomass yield of plant mulches, total cabbage and onion yields, and biomass and number of weeds before planting and harvest of cabbage and before sowing and harvest of onion were assessed. Weed infestation was determined by the quantitative-weighting method. The biomass yields of phacelia and oat amounted to 26.6 and 24.8 t·ha−1, respectively, and were almost 2.5-times higher than biomass yields of serradella and vetch. The average cabbage and onion yields were 45.8 and 41.9 t·ha−1, respectively. The yields of vegetables following mulches were higher than the yields recorded in the unmulched control. The weed species most often found in the experiment were Viola arvensis Murr., Capsella bursa pastoris, Matricaria indora L., Chenopodium album L., and Stellaria media (L.) Vill. Of the examined dates of mulch ploughing down, the spring-incorporated mulches were most effective in reducing the number of weeds in cabbage whereas the nonincorporated mulches showed such an effect in onion. Nonlegumes (phacelia and oat) used as mulch produced higher fresh biomass yields than did vetch and serradella. Oat and phacelia mulches significantly reduced the fresh biomass and number of weeds before cabbage planting. Additionally, oat mulch reduced the fresh biomass of weeds before cabbage harvest. Also, oat and phacelia mulches reduced the number of weeds before onion harvest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Festulolium (×Festulolium) is a cross between the two species fescue (Festuca L.) and ryegrass (Lolium L.) and is a promising forage and seed crop. To stimulate the production of Danish organic festulolium seeds a three-year field experiment was performed from 1999 to 2002 in a ryegrass-type festulolium, Paulita, and in a fescue-type festulolium, Hykor. The objectives were to examine the influence of row spacing (12, 24, and 36 cm) and seed rate (8, 12, or 16 kg ha−1) on plant establishment, development, and seed yield. Observations of autumn and spring in-row plant densities indicated satisfactory plant establishment in all combinations of seed rate and row spacing. The number of reproductive tillers was in the range from 800 to 2200 m−2 in Paulita and from 500 to 1300 m−2 in Hykor. Row spacing had an effect on the number of reproductive tillers and in both cultivars the highest number was achieved at 12-cm row spacing. Seed yields in the Italian ryegrass type averaged from 1050 to 1150 kg ha−1 and in the tall fescue type from 650 to 800 kg ha−1. Doubling row spacing from 12 to 24 cm had no effect on seed yield in Hykor, while a further increase of row spacing to 36 cm showed a decrease in seed yield. No effect of row spacing on seed yield was observed in Paulita. Neither of the two types was affected in seed yield by seed rate. The fact that row spacing in both types can be increased to 24 cm without having a concomitant negative effect on seed yield implies that mechanical weed control is an optional management technique. Therefore our results have important implications in/for organic grass-seed production.",

The soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and forest vegetation C pools were estimated using field data and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tier 1 method. The analysis of a temporal series of satellite imagery was found to be an effective tool to determine the land-use-change dynamics in the mountain watershed. During the period 1976–2003, overall forest area decreased by 24%, with significant increase in area under cultivated lands (82%). While taking into account the individual land-use types, the areas under rainfed upland, managed dense forest, and Schima–Castanopsis forest increased by 200, 174, and 58%, respectively, with substantial decreases in both degraded forest/shrub lands (35%) and pine mixed forest (92%). The effects of land-use change on SOC pool varied according to the type of land-use change. There was a net gain in the SOC pool in the larger part of the watershed during 1976–1989, but in the period 1989–2003 a net loss was observed. Conversion from forest to cultivated lands has resulted in a severe loss of vegetation carbon. However, in the future, there will be higher vegetation carbon pools in the watershed, because a significant land area under degraded forest/shrub land and pine mixed forest has been converted to managed-dense forest and Schima–Castanopsis forest, which were shown to contain significantly higher amounts of vegetation carbon.",

    "abstract": "On the Loess Plateau of China, lots of check-dams were constructed originally for sediment management. Simultaneously, these artificial projects can change the hydrological cycle in the form of collecting runoff and conserving water. An understanding of soil water spatial distribution in dam farmland is crucial for water resource management as well as the layout of check-dams construction. In this study, soil water spatial distribution in a selected dam farmland was analyzed by taking 2288 soil samples in autumn and spring, respectively. The results showed that the soil water contents presented obvious stratification characteristics along the soil profiles. From the back position to the front position along the alluvial direction, the mean soil water content and its variability showed by coefficient of variation (CV) increased. For different transects, semivariograms of soil water content of 0–150 cm can be generally well fitted by Gaussian model except for transect 9, which behaved the deepest soil layer and the nearest away from the dam body. Geostatistical analysis showed that from back position to front position, not only nugget variance but also structural variance increased but for correlation length, it decreased. These changes of spatial structure were believed to be associated with the sedimentation deposition characteristics along the alluvial direction. Soil water content with depth generally showed moderate spatial dependency. Compared with autumn, the soil water content in spring was significantly lower. The magnitude of variability in autumn was generally somewhat larger than in spring. For correlation length, however, it was a little smaller in autumn than in spring.",

For this work, 'organic' refers to commercial fertilizers manufactured from wastes such as sewage sludge (biosolid), poultry byproducts (manure, litter, feather meal), or other byproducts (whey, meals, oils). Organic fertilizers can behave as a slow-release N fertilizer, with a delayed greening response, low burn potential, and varying N release rates in different environments. Three separate 3-month long studies (one creeping bentgrass, two hybrid bermudagrass) evaluated the effects of organic fertilizers on various turfgrass and soil parameters. The objectives of this research were to evaluate turfgrass response to organic fertilizers in the field by measuring turf colour, quality, clipping yield, N uptake, total soil microbial biomass, soil inorganic (NO3-N, NH4-N), and organic N and carbon content. Organic N sources included materials made from dehydrated biosolids, turkey litter, and meat, bone, blood and feather meal. These sources were compared with hybrid bermudagrass and bentgrass fertilized with urea or a commercial urea/methylene urea fertilizer. All N sources were applied one time each year at a rate of 4.9 g N m−2. Plots were moved to a new location in each year of the study. In general, application of sources with large portions (or 100%) of soluble N (urea and a urea/methylene urea blend) produced turf with a darker green colour, higher N content, and greater clipping yield than plots fertilized with materials containing organic N. Urea provided consistent high quality colour for the same 10–12 week period as the organic sources, and no organic source provided acceptable colour for any longer period than soluble N sources. There were few differences in soil N, C, or microbial biomass due to N source.",

The experimental object was agrophytocenoses of spring barley – Hordeum vulgare L. – crop of spring barley ‘Aura’ and unsown soil, and weeds growing in them. The crop was formed sowing 0, 120, 200 and 280 kg ha−1 (0, 2.7, 4.5 and 6.2 million seeds per ha−1 respectively) seeds of spring barley ‘Aura’. Spring barley crop was not harrowed and herbicides were not applied. In the field experiment estimates were made of changes of weeds and spring barley inter- and within- species competition optimizing crop density. During three years of field experiment in the crop of spring barley annual weeds prevailed at 88–99%, such as Chenopodium album, Stellaria media, Erysimum cheiranthoides. Perennial weeds formed 1–12% of the crop weeds, such as Sonchus arvensis, Cirsium arvense, Equisetum arvense. General number of weed species in spring barley crops varied from 13 to 21. Weed abundance proportionally declined in the crops of higher density, hence, higher seed rate should be recommended for organic agriculture where weeds are controlled in non-chemical ways. Consistently increasing barley stand density, the competition between species (spring barley with weeds) gradually turned into competition within species (between barley plants) when a higher number of weaker and non-productive stems started forming. Spring barley yield did not significantly depend on the stand density. Increasing stand density enhanced cultivated crop yield to a certain level (200 kg ha−1), since an increase in spring barley plant number resulted in the reduction in weight per plant and 1000 grain weight, which was compensated by an increase in the number of spring barley plants. Different spring barley density had an essential influence on the chemical composition of weeds which was similar to that of spring barley. Weeds accumulated the greatest amount of crude proteins, crude fat and crude fibre growing without spring barley.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The fragile ecosystem of China's Loess Plateau is being exposed to increasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition but little information about the response of the region's natural vegetation is currently available. We studied the responses of aboveground biomass (AGB) to simulated nitrogen deposition in a field experiment conducted on natural grassland on sunny and shady slopes. Three levels of simulated nitrogen deposition were applied, and two treatments with phosphorus were included to test for secondary phosphorus limitation. For the same level of nitrogen deposition, grass generally grew better on the shady slope than on the sunny slope. Compared to a control treatment with no additional nitrogen, we found: (1) the 2.5 g N m−2 yr−1 treatment significantly increased biomass only on the sunny slope; (2) the total AGB increased significantly in the 5 g N m−2 yr−1 treatment on both the shady slope (by 31%) and the sunny slope (by 25%); and (3) for 10 g N m−2 yr−1, AGB was also significantly increased, however, phosphorus limitation became more apparent, and soil nitrate N levels increased significantly, suggesting nitrogen saturation and the potential for nitrate pollution. The AGB of Stipa bungeana (the dominant grass) was significantly increased by nitrogen, but not by phosphorus. The biomass of the second dominant species Lespedeza davurica Schindl., was not affected by increased nitrogen but addition of phosphorus had some positive impact. Therefore, nitrogen deposition was proven to have effects on plant growth in our study area on the Loess Plateau of China, but high level of nitrogen deposition would result in P limitation. Furthermore, increasing nitrogen deposition is likely to induce diversity change.",

This study investigated the effects of plantation species on major soil physical and chemical properties and further evaluated the soil quality under different land uses. Soil samples in triplicates, collected under different plantations, were analysed for their physical and chemical properties. Based on these soil properties, an integrated soil quality index was determined. The soil bulk density (BD) varied from 0.72 to 0.80 cm−3 in plantations established on primary forest land and natural forest and from 0.86 to 1.14 g cm−3 in those plantations established on cultivated soils. Also significantly lower pore volume and infiltration rate were observed under plantations established on cultivated lands than those on primary forest soils. Higher water volume (% at −1500 kPa matric potential) was obtained in soils under Juniperus procera and natural forest compared with that under the rest of the plantations investigated. The concentration of soil organic carbon (SOC) varied from 3.4 to 10.2%, N from 0.3 to 1.0% and Av.P from 1.5 to 7.0% in soils under plantations and natural forest. Exchangeable cations generally showed a decreasing trend with depth in all land use types with minor exceptions. The concentrations of exchangeable Ca+2 varied from 6.5 to 22.7 cmol kg−1 and were significantly higher under Juniperus procera than under Eucalyptus species. The soil under plantations on previously cultivated lands showed soil quality index below 0.5 (the baseline value), while those established on undisturbed forest soil were generally above that value. The study results suggest that selecting species such as Juniperus procera and prolonging the harvesting period would improve and maintain the quality of soil properties.",

In one geophysical approach, fields were mapped to characterize the horizontal variability in apparent electrical conductivity down to 1.5 m soil depth using an electromagnetic induction meter (EM38 device). The data obtained were geo-referenced by dGPS. The other approach consisted of measuring the vertical variability in electrical conductivity along transects using a multi-electrode apparatus for electrical resistivity tomography (GeoTom RES/IP device) down to 2 m depth. Geophysical field work was complemented by soil analyses. The results showed that despite 40 years of different fertilization regimes, treatments had no significant effects on the apparent electrical conductivity. Instead, the comparison of sites revealed high and low conductivity soils, with gradual differences explained by soil texture. A significant, linear relationship found between apparent electrical conductivity and soil clay content explained 80% of the variability measured. In terms of soil depth, both low and high electrical conductivity values were measured. Abrupt changes in electrical conductivity within a field revealed the presence of 'deviating areas'. Higher values corresponded well with layers with a high clay content, while local inclusions of coarse-textured materials caused a high variability in conductivity in some fields. The geophysical methods tested provided useful information on the variability in soil texture at the experimental sites. The use of spatial EC variability as a co-variable in statistical analysis could be a complementary tool in the evaluation of experimental results.",

Fifteen days after sowing, osmotic stress was applied by means of 25 mM mannitol (low stress level) or by 75 mM mannitol (high stress level). Fifteen days after treatment plants were harvested and different physiological and biochemical parameters were analysed. Results showed no significant differences between the studied symbioses under control conditions. However after exposure to osmotic stress our results showed better tolerance of COCOT to osmotic stress when inoculated with the native R. gallicum 8a3. This can be partially explained by better water-use efficiency in both leaves and nodules, better relative water content in nodules and better efficiency in utilization of rhizobial symbiosis as compared with COCOT-CIAT 899 symbiosis. Hence, the present study suggested the better use of native soil isolated strains for the inoculation of common bean in order to improve its performance and nitrogen fixation potential under stressful conditions.",

Soil moisture content was studied between January 2005 and December 2006 at different depths (from 0–150 cm) with a neutron probe. The results showed that mean soil moisture content in the evergreen broad-leaved forest was usually higher than in the tea tree plantation in the dry season, whereas it was lower than the tea tree plantation in the rainy season. In addition, mean soil moisture content was depth dependent, and in the 10–50 cm layer the spatial variability was due to the active root zone within this depth area in two types of land use. From 50–150 cm, the spatial variability was slightly increasing in the evergreen broad-leaved forest or relatively stable in the tea tree plantation. Our study also showed that soil moisture content was higher and more stable under the evergreen broad-leaved forest than the tea tree plantation, hence we stress that evergreen broad-leaved forest plays an important role in holding soil moisture. It is suggested that the protection of evergreen broad-leaved forest should be strengthened.",

So far, scientific focus has been on the effects of cropping systems on soil characteristics. The main findings indicate that soil porosity and hydraulic conductivity were greater in cropping systems with a large proportion of ley, soil bulk density showed the opposite trend. In terms of chemical properties, cropping systems incorporating more ley also have greater soil organic carbon content than annual crops systems, and both soil carbon and N storage decrease over time in cropping systems with only annual crops.

In growth chamber experiments, plants were grown for 3 weeks in sand with 12.5, 25, 50 or 200 mg N L−1 in the irrigation water and at two mowing intensities, cut at 5 mm twice per week or uncut. It proved possible to control important turf grass traits such as shoot growth rate, shoot:root ratio, leaf morphology and carbohydrate storage through leaf N concentration. The relationship between leaf N concentration and aboveground growth was linear for both cut and uncut turf. The relative N demand of the studied species, based on their N productivity, was 1:0.67:0.67:0.37 for creeping bentgrass, velvet bentgrass, chewings fescue and slender creeping red fescue, respectively. Clipping significantly reduced N productivity, and hence turf N demand. The lowest possible leaf N concentration without adverse effects on plant health and appearance was between 3.1 and 3.5% of dry matter (DM) in both bentgrasses and fescues. This value can be used as a target in minimizing fertilizer usage and N leaching losses. In conclusion, fertilization based on the influence of leaf N concentration on growth-related processes offers possibilities to control growth in a predictable and desirable manner under varying climate and growth conditions. This could provide more environmentally friendly and economic fertilization regimes and also better playing quality.",

Twenty-one genotypes of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) derived from a half diallel cross between six inbred lines were evaluated in both stress and non-stress conditions using a randomized complete block design for each one. Eight drought tolerance indices comprising stress tolerance index (STI), mean productivity (MP), geometric mean productivity (GMP), harmonic mean (HM), stress susceptibility index (SSI), tolerance index (TOL), yield index (YI) and yield stability index (YSI) were calculated based on grain yield under stress and non-stress environments. Significant genotypic differences were observed in TOL, GMP, MPSTI, HM and YI. Diallel analyses revealed the importance of both additive and non-additive gene effects in GMP, STI, HM and YI. However, the Baker ratio supported the predominance of an additive effect in their expression. Our results demonstrated that SSI, YSI, TOL and MP are not reliable indices to select drought tolerant genotypes in sunflower breeding programmes because of their low heritability. Indices such as GMP, STI, HM and YI were moderately heritable and are usually able to select high-yielding genotypes in both environments and could be usefully employed in drought tolerance breeding programmes of sunflower.",

In this study, we integrated CENTURY 4.5 model with GIS to assess the soil organic carbon sensitivity to climate variable shifting and atmospheric carbon dioxide enrichment in northern Chinese grasslands. The response of top soil (0–20 cm) organic carbon to climate change depended on the relative sensitivity of net primary productivity and soil respiration. A 4°C increase in soil temperature led to a loss of 4.7% of soil organic carbon in the Alpine Meadow region, but the same temperature increase led to a maximum loss of only 2.3% of soil organic carbon in the Temperate Steppe region. The effects of precipitation changes on soil organic carbon were varied depending on the moisture level of the local grassland system. The direct effect of carbon dioxide enrichment was to reduce carbon loss throughout northern Chinese grasslands, especially in droughty regions. Alpine Meadow was the most sensitive region under climate change, and it will become the biggest potential carbon source in Chinese grasslands as climate warming continues to occur. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations led to net carbon sequestration in all grasslands and tended to diminish the carbon loss driven by precipitation and temperature changes.",

This study describes grass seed production of three different types, respectively, of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) and their optimum number of growing seasons in terms of yield, selected yield components and economic gain. Three harvest years gave the maximum yield in the red fescue type with long stolons (cv. Pernille) and the highest number of fertile tillers in all three red fescue cultivars. Four harvest years gave the maximum yield for types with short stolons (cv. Suzette) and without stolons (cv. Tamara). The fifth year significantly reduced the yield compared to the highest obtained yield within each cultivar. The diploid amenity cv. Allegro and forage type cv. Borvi of perennial ryegrass can be harvested in five consecutive years without a significant yield reduction. The tetraploid type cv. Tivoli had the highest thousand seed weight and a significant yield decrease from the first to the second year of seed harvest and a continuous decline in seed yield is observed from the first to the fifth harvest year in this cultivar. Yet, when the economic incentive was calculated it was found that optimum harvest years cannot be determined by yield considerations alone. A combination of high grass seed price and low cereal price shows that red fescue can be grown up to four years and perennial ryegrass up to five years with high economic returns.",

This study aimed to examine the physical protection of C and GHG emissions provided by soil macroaggregates in a cultivated volcanic soil under no-till soil management and different N source fertilization and liming additions. A long-term experiment under no-till system was used. Studied plots had been fertilized annually from 1996 to the present with four fertilization treatments: nitrate (T1), ammonium (T2), ammonium plus 0.5 Mg CaCO3 ha−1 (T3), and ammonium plus 1 Mg CaCO3 ha−1 (T4). Soil samples were collected in 2009. From each treatment, six sizes of soil macroaggregates were obtained by dry sieving (0.25–0.5 mm, 0.5–1 mm, 1–2 mm, 2–4 mm, 4–6 mm, >6 mm in diameter): one subsample was kept undisturbed and another subsample was finely crushed. Microbial biomass and CO2 and N2O emissions were evaluated through soil aerobic incubations in laboratory. There was a trend of smaller macroaggregate that showed higher CO2 emissions in T1 and T3, and higher N2O emissions were observed in T1, T2, and T3. It was concluded that soil macroaggregates larger than 2 mm produce less CO2 and N2O than smaller ones in a no-till systems. The physical protection exerted by soil macroaggregates on soil organic C was confirmed.",

Basil plantlets were transplanted 30 days after seeding, utilising a gravel-film technique hydroponic system under a 40% black-and-white shadenet structure. Plants were subjected to five plant densities, i.e. 10, 16, 20, 25 and 40 plants/m2, with two harvesting methods, i.e. tipping and cutting. Experimental layout was a randomised complete block design with four replicates. During the spring/summer season, the results showed no significant differences in plant growth and total yield per unit area at plant densities of 20, 25 or 40 plants/m2. Results during the summer/fall season showed the highest leaf fresh mass, leaf area and total plant fresh mass at the highest plant density of 40 plants/m2. Harvesting method did not have a significant effect on yield or on the total fresh and dry mass of basil. Results demonstrate that a plant density of 40 plants/m2 can improve growth and yield of basil significantly during the summer/fall season. However, during the spring/summer season, a plant density of 20 and 25 plants/m2 will be more cost effective with no significant effect on yield. Plant density recommendations are, therefore, 40 plants/m2 during the summer/fall season and 20 or 25 plants/m2 during spring/summer season.",

In addition to four NaCl levels of 50, 100, 150 and 200 mM, the treatments were repeated with 10 mM K and 10 mM Ca at each NaCl level. The results revealed that Na+ and Cl− concentrations were significantly increased and the K+, Ca2+ and NO3 − concentrations were decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations in the growth medium. Being very important to the physiology and biochemistry of plants decreases in K+, Ca2+ and NO3 − reduced both growth and the yield. The additions of K+ and Ca2+ reduced the Na+ and Cl− concentrations in the plant tissues, increased the K+, Ca2+ and NO3 − concentrations, resulting in an improvement in the marketable yield of the spinach plants. Even though the effects of supplemental K+ and Ca2+ were similar in some plants at different salt concentrations, the effect of additional Ca2+ alone was higher overall. Thus, the results of this study confirmed the principal effects of K+ and Ca2+ supplies in reducing the detrimental effects of salinity.",

In three field trials with 5–45% infected seeds no significant improvements on yields were seen from seed treatments, indicating that the Danish threshold of 15% attacked seeds is a conservative threshold. In two field trials including seed lots with more than 90% infected seeds, fludioxonil improved germination by approximately 100%, which led to an improved crop stand and yield increases in the range of 1.2–1.5 tonnes ha−1. Attacks of Fusarium head blight were relatively slight in the two trials and the content of deoxynivalenol was below the EU limits of 1250 ppb in the harvested grain. Even so, seed treatments with fludioxonil did not help reduce attacks of Fusarium head blight at GS 75 or content of deoxynivalenol in the harvested grain.",

Results showed that Fe-deficient plants excreted large amounts of LMWOAs in comparison with Fe-sufficient plants across all Cd treatments (p <0.05). In both cases the concentrations of the four organic acids were tartaric > citric > malic > acetic. The results showed that the Fe-deficient plants with higher concentrations of LMWOAs accumulated more Cd (p <0.05) and induced a decrease in solution pH compared with the Fe-sufficient plants. Cadmium accumulation in the Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient plants had significant positive correlations with the exudation of malic and acetic acids (p <0.05 and p<0.01). Cadmium accumulation in the Fe-sufficient plants had a significant (p<0.01) positive correlation with the exudation of tartaric acid, whereas there was a negative correlation (p<0.01) between Cd accumulation and the exudation of tartaric acid in the Fe-deficient plants. No significant correlation between the exudation of citric acid and Cd accumulation was obtained. Our results indicate that Fe-deficiency could induce Cd accumulation and translocation through an increase of LMWOAs exudation and pH alteration, both of which enhance Cd bioavailability.",

Four irrigation (Kcp) levels with a drip irrigation system based on adjustment coefficients (0, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.25) of pan evaporation were used. Nitrogen (N) treatments were consisted of four different nitrogen rates (0, 75, 150 and 225 kg N ha–1). The following yield and quality parameters were determined: curd weight, curd diameters, number of leaves per crop, above ground biomass (AGB) and curd/AGB ratio. Fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) and leaf mineral contents were also determined to clarify the productivity of N treatments. According to the results; the amount of irrigation water and/or total received water affects the plant water consumption, consequently, crop yield in a field grown cauliflower. The highest yield was obtained in Kcp1.0 irrigation level which represents full irrigation treatment. The excess water applications had negative effect on yield and AGB of cauliflower. Highest yield was obtained at 225 kg N ha–1. The water use efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency values increased with decreasing irrigation rate. However, lower Kcp coefficients resulted in lower total yield. The FUE in irrigation treatments showed linear increases from non irrigation to full irrigation plots. However, excessive irrigation caused a decrease in FUE. It can be recommended that the Kcp1.0 crop-pan coefficient with 225 kg ha–1 nitrogen application can be used to achieve the highest yield for field grown cauliflower in the Eastern Mediterranean coastal region of Turkey.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One problem in evaluating efforts to reduce phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) losses to waters is that variations in weather conditions cause nutrient concentrations and waterflow to vary. Analyses of biweekly stream water samples collected manually from two small, neighbouring Swedish agricultural catchments with clay soil (E23 and E24) demonstrated unpredictability in P and N concentrations. However, particulate P (PP) concentrations in the two separate catchments, usually sampled within 2–3 hours on the same day, were clearly correlated to each other (Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.70). Corresponding nitrate–nitrogen (NO3–N) concentrations were also correlated to each other (r=0.79). Particulate P concentrations could reasonably be predicted from suspended solid (SS) concentrations above base flow (BF) in both catchments (regression coefficient R 2=0.84 and 0.86, respectively). In the period 1993–2009, before eutrophication control programmes were introduced in catchment E23, there was no general trend in PP or SS in either catchment. Mean PP (0.13 mg L−1) predicted (R 2=0.88) from high-resolution (15 minute) turbidity concentrations was significantly higher than flow-weighted mean PP concentration estimated from discrete samples (0.10 mg L−1) collected manually at the catchment E23 outlet. Mean PP concentration estimated directly from flow-proportional sampling was also higher. High synoptic concentrations of PP (up to 0.65 mg L−1) were recorded along the open reach of the stream in the ascending limb of high-flow pulses. Using high-resolution monitoring at the catchment outlet, episodes with a clear clockwise hysteresis effect for PP concentration (seen as turbidity) were frequently observed. By contrast, the NO3–N peak appeared 4–7 hours after the flow peak and anticlockwise hysteresis was observed. Significant erosion along stream banks may take place, and the degree of erosion was estimated based both on farmers' observations and on results from a distributed erosion model (USPED). Monitoring and erosion mapping are currently being used in practical remedial work.",

Seventeen OFSP and eight white/cream-fleshed sweetpotato clones were evaluated across six diverse environments (Halaba, Kokate, Areka, Arbaminch, Hawassa and Dilla) in southern Ethiopia in 2014 using a 5 × 5 simple lattice design. Nutritional traits data were collected on dry-weight basis and subjected to analysis of variance and correlation analyses. Environment, genotype, and genotype × environment interaction effects were highly significant (p < 0.01) for all parameters measured. A newly developed genotype, designated G8, had the highest contents of β-carotene (20.01 mg 100 g−1), protein (7.08%), iron (2.55 mg 100 g−1), zinc (1.42 mg 100 g−1), fructose (4.45%), glucose (5.34%) and sucrose (16.20%). Genotypes G15 and G19 also performed relatively well for the above nutritional traits. The three genotypes, G8, G15 and G19 had mean fresh root yield of 23.5,13.7 and 21.3 tha−1, respectively. These genotypes had root dry matter content of 26.99%, 25.23% and 33.09%, respectively. Β-carotene content had significant positive correlations with iron, zinc, fructose, glucose and sucrose content. This reflects the potential to breed for OFSP varieties enriched with the important micro-nutrients. Overall, the candidate OFSP clones, G8 (Resisto × PIPI-2), G15 (Resisto × Temesgen-23) and G19 (Resisto × Ogansagen-23) were good sources of nutritional traits such as vitamin A, iron, zinc, protein, sucrose, glucose and fructose. The selected genotypes can be recommended for large-scale production, food processing or further sweetpotato improvement to alleviate nutrient deficiencies in Ethiopia or similar environments in sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "Data from a field experiment conducted in China's Loess Plateau (2013–2015) were used to determine the energy balance of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as affected by tillage and straw treatments. Tillage treatments included chisel plow, no tillage, and mouldboard plow. Crop straw levels included straw returning and straw removed. The energy balance was evaluated by comparing the following parameters: net energy, energy profitability, energy use efficiency, and energy intensity. The yield parameters were significantly influenced by the tillage treatments and revealed that the chisel plow entailed fewer field operations and lower energy requirements with a higher yield than mouldboard plowing tillage. The highest proportion of energy input came from a nitrogen fertiliser, followed by diesel fuel. The total energy input applied per hectare increased with an increase in the tillage intensity, and the lowest energy input was required for the no tillage case with the straw returning treatment, and the highest for the case of mouldboard plow with the straw returning treatment. The lowest average energy intensity was recorded for the no tillage case, followed by the case of chisel plow tillage in both cropping seasons. Moreover, in the case of mouldboard plough tillage, the maximum energy intensity was recorded in both cropping seasons. In the cases of the chisel plow tillage and the no tillage, we observed the maximum energy gain, while in the no tillage case, we observed the maximum energy use efficiency. The net return and the benefit/cost ratio were higher in the case of straw returning than those in the case of no straw treatment. We concluded that no tillage and chisel plow tillage with straw returning could improve the energy use efficiency and the benefit/cost ratio of winter wheat production systems.",

Here we study the effect of chemical characteristics of shoots and roots from fodder radish (Raphanus sativus oleiformis L.), a widely used cover crop, on the release of their C and N after addition to soil. Shoots and roots were incubated for 180 d at 20°C using four soils with different management histories (organic versus mineral fertiliser, with and without use of cover crops), and the release of CO 2 and extractable mineral N was determined. More shoot C than root C was mineralised during the first 10 d of incubation. After 180 d, 58% of the C input was mineralised with no difference between shoots and roots. At the end of incubation, shoots had released more N (42% of shoot N) than roots (28% of root N). Moreover, management history did not affect net mineralisation of added plant C. Residues incubated in soil with a management history involving cover crops showed an enhanced net N mineralisation. Therefore, long-term decomposition of C added in radish shoots and roots is unaffected by differences in chemical characteristics or soil management history. However, the net mineralisation of N in shoots is faster than for N in roots, and net N mineralisation of added materials is higher in soil with than without a history of cover crops.

Twelve soil samples were taken from two watersheds with IWSM and another 12 soil samples from two watersheds without IWSM at 30 cm soil depth. Physical, chemical, and biological properties of these soil samples were then analysed in a laboratory. Soil moisture content, Soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus (Pav) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spore density of soils were significantly high in watersheds with IWSM as compared to watersheds without IWSM. Although insignificant, total porosity, cation exchange capacity, Exchangeable bases and micronutrients also had higher mean value on watersheds with IWSM practices than watersheds without. Thus, this study reviled that an introduction of these IWSM practices has a positive impact in improving soil-health. Moreover, IWSM practices implemented on dolerite geological formation showed a higher impact on soil-health as compared to management practices implemented on sandstone geological formation.",

Among them, five bacterial isolates viz., BTR1.0, BTR1.1, BTR4.4, BTR7.0 and BTR8.6 were found to inhibit the mycelial growth of P. aphanidermatum. The maximum antagonistic effect was shown by BTR1.0 followed by BTR7.0 and BTR1.1. Based on the MALDI Biotyper analysis, these bacterial isolates were identified as Serratia marcescens (BTR1.0 and BTR1.1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BTR7.0 and BTR8.6) and Alcaligenes faecalis (BTR4.4). Analysis of plant growth stimulating activity of bacterial strains revealed that A. faecalis BTR4.4 recorded the highest vigour index followed by S. marcescens BTR1.0. The biocontrol activity of bacterial antagonists against tomato damping-off was tested under salt-water irrigation. Among the bacterial strains tested, S. marcescens BTR1.1 was found to be highly effective under non-saline water irrigation, which suppressed the disease by 68% compared to infected control. However, at 50 mM NaCl concentration, S. marcescens strain BTR1.0, P. aeruginosa strain BTR7.0 and A. faecalis BTR4.4 provided a significant level of control of the disease. At 100 mM NaCl concentration, no significant effect of the bacterial strains on the disease incidence was observed.",

Understanding the three-dimensional (3D) spatial distribution of soil nutrients in mining area farmland is crucial for agricultural production and environmental management.

In our study, a sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) algorithm was used to analyse the spatial distribution of SOM based on observations of 180 soil samples in the Zhaogu mine in China. The results showed that the SOM content had considerable variation in spatial distribution at different soil depths (0–20, 20–40, 40–60 cm) and decreased with the increase in soil depth. The spatial variability of surface organic matter was the largest, and the coefficient of variation was 29.38%, which was moderately mutated. The spatial distribution of SOM also varied among slope locations. The SOM content was higher upslope and downslope than on the middle slope. In addition, given a threshold, SGS can be used to calculate the probability that the organic matter content at any position is lower or higher than the given value.

Apple orchard soils' intercropping of three different forage species, including native wild grasses, red clover (RC), ryegrass, and clean tillage (CT) at varying depths (0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm), was analyzed using Biolog Eco-PlateTM. The average well color development (AWCD) in samples subject to ELISA indicated that the carbon metabolic capacities of the microbial community in RC soil were greater than those in the remaining three soil treatments, with no significant (P>0.05) differences among the three depths. Diversity and richness indices of the bulk soil samples (except the RC) declined significantly with depth, while the evenness indices of most soil samples only demonstrated a slight change. The diversity and richness indices of the CT of 0–10-cm soil sample were markedly higher than those of 10–20-cm and 20–30-cm soil samples, especially when compared with the remaining three soil treatments. Principal component (PC) analysis showed that the CT soil at 10–20 and 20–30 cm was oriented in the axis-positive direction of the PC2 axis, but was oriented in the axis-negative direction at 0–10 cm. Therefore, we surmise that there exists an extensive microbial diversity among the soil samples. In summary, our results show that planting RC improved microbial community functional diversity to a greater extent than did the other forage species and CT at all the three measured soil depths, except for CT at a 0–10 cm soil depth.",

Hence, in the present study, identification, quantification, and contribution of organic acids present in its leaf extract were conducted using the principle of bioassay-guided procedure. High pressure liquid chromatography identified four organic acids, viz. citric, malic, oxalic, and tartaric acids, in its leaf aqueous extract with the predominance of oxalic acid (7.5 g kg−1 leaves fresh weight) followed by tartaric acid (7.3 g kg−1). The allelopathic activity of identified acids and aqueous extract was evaluated on lettuce seedlings growth based on the specific activity (EC50). The crude extract reduced radicle growth more adversely than hypocotyl at the concentration of 2.5 g L−1 (EC50). It hindered the normal physiological growth process through weak and curly seedlings, and necrosis of their tips. Among the identified acids, oxalic acid had the highest specific activity (40 mg L−1) and citric acid had the lowest (>1000 mg L−1). As a consequence of its high contents, the total activity, a function of specific activity and concentration, of oxalic acid (188) was found higher followed by tartaric acid (146). The contribution of both acids influencing the specific activity of the crude extract was then turned out to be 74%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report identifying the oxalic and tartaric acids as growth inhibitors in tamarind leaves and quantifying their contribution in its allelopathic expression. Based on the total activity, the results suggested that oxalic and tartaric acids are the major allelochemicals in tamarind leaves. The allelopathic potential of these acids might promote the development of natural herbicides as an alternative to the synthetic ones in a most sustainable manner.",

The present research was aimed to study SWG genetic resources for most important agrobiological traits with a view of extending the range of energy plants in the Nemoral zone of Europe. SWG was studied for the peculiarities of developmental stages, winter hardiness, and dry matter (DM) yield. SWG regrowth in spring started one month later compared to the reed canary grass (variety ‘Chiefton’). All investigated genotypes matured seeds in the second half of September. The most winter-hardy SWG accessions (0–20% winter damage) were the majority of wild ecotypes and the variety ‘Dacotah’ from North Dakota (2–4 hardiness zone) as well as the variety ‘Summer’ from South Nebraska (4, 5 hardiness zone). Ecotypes from North Dakota exhibited a high breeding potential and prospects in Northern regions of Europe due to genotypic variation of winter hardiness trait. The varieties ‘Alamo’, ‘Falcon’, ‘Grenville’, ‘Shawnee’, and ‘Trailblazer’ that originated from warmer climate zones (6–9 hardiness zone) were heavily damaged or completely killed. The worst overwinter survival of plants was recorded after the first winter. DM yield was estimated at two regimens of cutting. When grass was cut once at seed maturity stage, DM yield in the first harvest year was 249 g per plant, in the second harvest year 349 g per plant, and in the third harvest year 493 g per plant. When grass was cut twice per season (at the beginning of anthesis and after regrowth of aftermath), DM yield was significantly lower: in the first harvest year the DM yield was 203 g per plant (18.4% less), in the second harvest year 182 g per plant (47.9% less), and in the third harvest year 272 g per plant (44.7% less).",

    "abstract": "The potential of bambara groundnut as a crop-based approach for the sustainable reduction of protein–energy malnutrition prevalent in Nigeria is still being explored. However, one of the limitations to sustainable production of this adapted species is low and unstable yield. Here, we employed multiple statistical analyses to determine traits that could be useful in predicting grain yield. Furthermore, additive main effect and multiplicative interaction and genotype × genotype × environment models were used to identify high yielding and stable landraces. Twenty-four bambara landraces were evaluated in two contrasting dry land growing seasons at four environments. Based on the results of correlation, path coefficient values and stepwise multiple regression analysis, it is reasonable to assume that seed growth rate would be effective as indirect selection criteria for grain yield improvement in this set of breeding materials under early and late planting environment. However, optimizing biomass growth rate, pod fill period, 100-seed weight, number of pods per plant and time to flowering may have important role in the improvement of grain yield in bambara groundnut. Due consideration should be given to 100-seed weight and time to flowering in the early dry and late planting environment. The possibility of successful cultivation of bambara groundnut in forest–savannah transition agricultural zone of Nigeria, particularly when planting is done around early August has been established in this study. However, based on the strong association between seed yield and its related characters in early and late planting environments, selection for higher seed growth rate combined with large number of pods appears to be the best indirect traits when selecting bambara groundnut plants to enhance grain yield under early and late planting environments. While landraces TVSu 1520 and 1578 were considered the best adapted landraces, TVSu 1670 and 1518 are promising landraces that could contribute to increasing grain yield stability.",

    "abstract": "Efficient nitrogen (N) applications are crucial for sustainable agricultural development. A three-year field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of N fertilization on soil NO3-N contents, N balance, grain yield, and N use efficiency of film-mulched maize (Zea mays L.) in the semiarid northwest China. Six N levels were examined: 0 (N0), 100 (N100), 200 (N200), 250 (N250), 300 (N300), and 400 (N400) kg N ha−1. Results showed that residual soil NO3-N contents after harvest and apparent N losses markedly increased with increased N fertilizer rate. High accumulations of soil NO3-N were detected in the 80–200 cm layers in the N300 and N400 treatments in 2010 and 2011, indicating that excessive N applications resulted in NO3-N leaching in this semiarid region. The N use efficiency decreased with increased N fertilizer rate, but insignificant differences in agronomic efficiency, apparent recovery efficiency, and physiological efficiency were observed between N100, N200, and N250 treatments. Maize grain yields increased with N fertilization, but it did not further increase when N application was higher than plant N requirements. A linear plateau relationship was observed between grain yield and N supply (fertilizer N plus initial soil NO3-N in the 0–100 cm layers). The minimal N supply rate required to obtain the maximum yield (13.9 Mg ha−1) was 279 kg N ha−1, which was similar to plant N uptake and simultaneously reduced apparent N losses. We conclude that N fertilizer recommendations which consider soil NO3-N contents can simultaneously provide sufficient N for high yields and improve N fertilization of film-mulched maize in the semiarid areas.",

We aimed to assess the efficacy of some contemporary by-products to provide nutrients to crops as well as the potential harm of adding toxic elements to the environment. Four different by-products widely available in Northern Europe were tested for their effects on two nutrient-poor agricultural soils in terms of increasing available macro- and micro-nutrients as well as toxic elements. Assessing soil microbial community as a sensitive tool for evaluating soil quality was conducted with the focus on microbial activity, carbon metabolism and on Rhizobium/Agrobacterium. Wood ash increased pH and CaEDTA, KEDTA and MgEDTA in the soils. The only increase in EDTA-extractable micronutrients in the soils was observed by applying pot ale, increasing Cu. None of the amendments increased the availability of Pb and Cd in the soils. Soils amended with the by-products thus remained similar to the unamended control but were quite different from fully mineral fertilised soils. There were no detectable adverse effects on the physiological and genetic profiles of microbial communities. The by-products were moderately beneficial and did not change the soil microbial community as much as the fully fertilised treatment with mineral fertilisers. Changes in the microbial community profiles were probably due to direct effects on microbes limited by K, Ca and N as opposed to indirect effects on plant growth. This is potentially significant in understanding how to improve impoverished and marginal soils as microbial activity affects many other ecosystem functions.",

    "abstract": "A three-year field experiment was carried out in Mediterranean conditions to study the effects of different irrigations and organic fertilizers on yield, quality and nitrogen utilization of eggplant crop and on soil properties. In a split-plot design, two irrigation treatments (re-establishing 100% and 50% of the calculated maximum evapotranspiration) and four fertilizer treatments (mineral fertilizer, commercial stable manure, anaerobic digestate and municipal solid waste compost) were compared. The highest water volume increased significantly the total and marketable yield, the number of marketable fruits, the dry matter of fruits and the nitrogen-use efficiency with respect to the treatment with the lowest irrigation. Nevertheless, the same treatment decreased significantly the fruit dry matter percentage and total soluble solid content. The lowest water volume led to an improvement of fruit quality. Anaerobic digestate increased significantly the total and marketable yield and dry matter compared with compost. Harvest index, nitrogen harvest index, pH, acidity and total soluble solids did not show significant differences among all fertilizer treatments. N translocation ability of plants and fruit quality were not influenced by the type of fertilizer. At the end of experiment, anaerobic digestate and compost reached the highest levels of soil total organic carbon and humic and fulvic acids content. Besides, anaerobic digestate increased the total extractable carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen content compared to all other treatments. Soil copper, nickel and lead content in all treatments enhanced compared to that at the beginning of experiment, but this accumulation did not represent a possible environmental risk. The content of heavy metals in the soil, after 3 years of application, did not exceed the limits imposed by the Italian law. This study showed that the organic wastes, after being adequately processed, could be applied successfully in agriculture especially in arid environments, characterized by quick mineralization and very low organic matter content.",

Seed with high and low levels of infection was mixed to obtain six infection levels in the proportions of 100/0, 80/20, 60/40, 40/60, 20/80, and 0/100 percent.

In the field trials using untreated seed, there were significant differences between infection levels only for some agronomic characters and levels. Fungicide seed treatment with CEFM in spring wheat had no significant effect on most agronomic characters including yield. In winter wheat and oats, seed treatment with CFM increased yield by 7–11% and plant density by up to 33% while having no effect on other characters. The percentage discoloration of crown roots and stem bases due to Fusarium/Microdochium spp. was also investigated visually in winter wheat and oats and found to increase with higher infection level. Fungicide seed treatment thus mainly increased plant emergence in seed lots with low-to-moderate Fusarium/Microdochium spp. infection and had little or no effects on other agronomic characters.",

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of farmer's practice and optimal water and nitrogen management on nitrate leaching, and water and nitrogen use efficiencies (WUE, NUE) during winter wheat season in the NCP. A winter wheat experiment with four treatments (traditional irrigation plus traditional fertilizer, W1N1; traditional irrigation plus optimal fertilizer, W1N2; optimal irrigation plus traditional fertilizer, W2N1; optimal irrigation plus optimal fertilizer, W2N2) was conducted from October 1999 to June 2001 in Beijing suburban. The soil–plant system, water and solute transport model was calibrated and validated based on the data collected from the experimental field, then the model was used to simulate the water movement, nitrogen (N) transport, and crop growth process. The results showed that the simulated soil water content, nitrate concentration in the soil profile, leaf area index, crop N uptake, and grain yield were all in good agreement with the measured data. The simulated results indicated that the improved management of water and fertilizer practice could increase crop yield, and reduce water drainage, nitrate leaching, and gaseous N loss compared to farmers' practice. WUE and NUE under improved practice were 1.36 kg m−3 and 34.9 kg kg−1N−1 in 2000, 1.07 kg m−3 and 31.5 kg kg−1N−1 in 2001, respectively. Compared to farmers' practice, the optimal management practice can save water about 4–19%, water drainage decreased 50–65%, N leaching reduced over 90% and gaseous N loss decreased about 70%, at same time leading to an increase in WUE and NUE by 10.6% and 10.3% in 2000, 64.5% and 98.3% in 2001, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Reduced soil tillage and wheat monoculture have become increasingly widespread technologies in Latvia. The aim of this study was to estimate the development of winter wheat crown and root rot, depending on soil tillage and crop rotation. Two-factor experiments were carried out from 2009 to 2012: (1) crop rotation and (2) soil management. The incidence of the complex of stem-base diseases (root and crown rot) was determined after wheat harvesting. Causal agents were determined microscopically; species of Fusarium were identified by sequencing the Transcription Elongation Factor (TEF) region and subsequent phylogenetic clustering of acquired DNA sequences. The most important factor influencing the progression of crown and root rot was year (p < 0.05). The disease incidence among years fluctuated between 13 and 72%. Crop rotation (p < 0.05) and soil tillage method (p < 0.1) also affected the level of crown and root rot development. Conventional soil tillage slightly decreased disease development. The disease incidence in continuous wheat cropping was 10% higher compared to that in winter wheat fields following oilseed rape. The spectrum of pathogens and other fungi did not differ depending on soil tillage and crop rotation. The most common pathogens were fungi of the Fusarium genus: on average, 36% of isolates were identified as Fusarium spp: F. culmorum and F. avenaceum were the dominant species, but F. sporotrichioides and F. trinctum were also identified. The problem of wheat stem base and root rot is complex; different circumstances and unknown factors influence the spectrum of causal agents and the total disease level. Further investigations are necessary to research changes in disease development during a longer time period, as well as to clarify the occurrence of different pathogens, depending on different factors.",

To study the effect of soil crust on sloping farmland on runoff amount and erosion sediment yield, the soil crust on sloping farmland has been studied in this paper for plantings of corn, soybeans, millet, and winter wheat. Using an outdoor rainfall simulator, the influence of soil crust on runoff rate and sediment yield on sloping farmland covered by crops has been observed. The results revealed that soil crust thickness was increased after rainfall and soil crust coverage showed little change after rainfall. Soil crust had a significant impact on runoff and sediment yield on sloping farmland. Slopes with soil crust showed higher runoff rate and less soil loss than slopes without soil crust. On slopes planted with four crops (corn, soybeans, millet, and winter wheat), runoff rates on slopes with soil crust were respectively 20%, 25%, 25%, and 21% higher than on slopes without soil crust; sediment yield on slopes with soil crust was respectively 15%, 14%, 14%, and 8% lower than on slopes without soil crust. Crops enlarged the runoff difference between the two kinds of slope and decreased the sediment yield difference between them. Crop growth enhanced these differences in runoff and sediment yield between slopes with and without soil crust.",

Twenty-four compounds were identified in the oil among which d-limonene was a predominant component, followed by myrcene, α-pinene, linalool, sabinene, decanal, and other minor components. Direct contact toxicity assay showed the effectiveness of the essential oil against O. melanopus larvae causing the mortality of 85% during 48 hours. The persistence study revealed high dissipation rate of the oil from treated plants, whereas concentrations lower than 0.01 g/kg were detected by GC-MS 5 min after the application of the oil, suggesting its environmental and food safety. These results, together with previous literature reports reviewed in this study, indicate the great potential of the C. sinensis essential oil for future use in crop protection against insect pests.",

However, the impact of agronomic practices such as mulching on soil respiration in greenhouses has been less thoroughly studied. Consequently, field experiments were conducted during the growing seasons of 2011 and 2012 in greenhouse to evaluate soil respiration and the biotic and abiotic factors that influence it in hot pepper cultivation under four types of mulch practices (without mulch, wheat straw mulch, plastic film mulch, and combined mulch with plastic film and wheat straw). Soil water content had an overriding influence on soil respiration in hot pepper culture during the growing season under mulching treatments in a greenhouse, whereas the influence of soil temperature was relatively less. Additionally, the study showed that root biomass and root vigor should also be incorporated as predictor variables for soil respiration under mulching in greenhouses.",

A two-year small-scale field experiment was performed to determine the species complex and abundance of flea beetles (Chrysomelidae: Alticinae) associated with eight cruciferous oilseed plants: Brassica juncea (L.) Czern., Brassica napus L. var. oleifera subvar. annua, Brassica nigra (L.) Koch, Brassica rapa L. var. oleifera subvar. annua, Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz, Eruca sativa Mill., Raphanus sativus L. spp. oleifera (DC) Metzg. and Sinapis alba L. Their relative attractiveness to flea beetles was compared to assess their potential for use within a trap crop system for spring oilseed rape. Adults of six species of flea beetles were found on the test plants. Phyllotreta undulata Kutsch. was the most abundant species followed by Phyllotreta nigripes (Fabr.), Phyllotreta nemorum L. and Phyllotreta vittata (=striolata) (Fabr.), while Phyllotreta atra (Fabr.) and Chaetocnema concinna Marsh. were occasionally present. The species composition of flea beetles on seven of the investigated plant species was fairly similar but differed significantly on C. sativa. The flea beetle species discriminated between the tested host plants, with a general gradient in attraction from E. sativa > B. juncea > B. nigra > R. sativus > S. alba > B. rapa > B. napus through to C. sativa. Brassica juncea and B. nigra developed faster and at early growth stages were more attractive to overwintered adult flea beetles than B. napus and therefore had potential as trap plants to protect spring rape. R. sativus and E. sativa, despite their development rate being slower than B. napus were also more attractive to flea beetles. Thus, further experiments with a complex of attractive early season and late-season plant species (multiple trap crops) should be undertaken.",

We also present soil physical analyses and use the compaction verification tool (CVT) to assess compaction on plots with annual ploughing and minimum tillage, after using slurry tankers with contrasting wheel loads (4.1 Mg, 6.6 Mg) and wheeling intensities (1×/10×) in the 11th trial year, and yields monitored two years after compaction. Winter wheat yields in the period before compaction were strongly affected by tillage, with annual ploughing giving on average 24% higher yield than direct drilling. Both wheat and oats were far less affected in treatments with harrowing only or ploughing/harrowing alternate years, on average within 6% of annual ploughing. Yields after compaction were affected by both previous tillage and compaction intensity. In the first year, single wheeling after annual ploughing gave 23% yield reduction with 4.1 Mg wheel load and 28% reduction with 6.6 Mg wheel load, whilst multiple wheeling gave 14% reduction at 6.6 Mg wheel load. Yield reductions after minimum tillage ranged from 63% (single wheeling with 4.1 Mg) to 100% (multiple wheeling with 6.6 Mg). Similar trends were found in the second year. The soil physical data indicated that all wheeling led to changes in bulk density, pore sizes and permeability in both topsoil and subsoil on both sampled tillage plots. However, effects in the subsoil were partly masked by the soil's high initial bulk density, partly due to its high clay content. The CVT, which plots air capacity against hydraulic conductivity, suggested some harmful compaction on both plots, with the minimum tillage plot being less affected than the ploughed plot. However, yield results did not support this conclusion, indicating that other factors limited yields on the minimum tilled plot.",

Analysis of data from the Swedish environmental monitoring program on arable land showed that Ni concentrations in soils were significantly correlated with clay contents (R2 = 0.55; p < 0.001), while the correlation with organic matter content was weak, although significant (R2 = 0.02; p < 0.001). Concentrations of Ni in grains were positively correlated with the concentrations of total Ni in soil (R2 = 0.13; p < 0.001), negatively correlated with soil pH values (R2 = 0.14; p < 0.001), and multiple regression including Ni in soil and soil pH improved the correlation (R2 = 0.34). Therefore, analysis of total Ni concentrations in soils together with pH values can provide some guidance on where low Ni concentrations in crops are most likely to occur. Data from long-term field trials showed that Ni concentrations in wheat grain did not increase significantly after long-term application of cattle manure or sewage sludge compared with mineral fertilized or unfertilized treatments. Differences detected were attributed to pH changes in soil and differences in yields. It was found that Ni in organic amendments was not easily available for crop uptake. Application of inorganic fertilizer (NPK) decreased Ni concentrations in wheat grain compared with the unfertilized treatment, probably due to dilution in high-yielding crops. Concentrations in grains were low, and mean concentrations were 0.18, 0.07, and 1.20 for winter wheat, spring barley, and oats, respectively. For barley, this implies that 77% of the samples from the monitoring program had Ni concentrations below a proposed critical concentration for optimal germination (0.09 mg kg−1). Nickel shortage can be an overlooked problem in Swedish seed production that needs further attention.",

For this reason and for the purpose of diminishing the use of synthetic insecticides against the cabbage pests the field experiments in 2006 and 2008 were conducted. We found out that individual cabbage genotypes – they had different epicuticular wax content – differ in regard to their susceptibility to attacks by the studied groups of harmful insect pests. The highest susceptibility to attacks by Phyllotreta spp. was confirmed for the hybrid 'Cheers F1', in the first year (1.68 ± 0.05), as well as in the second year of the experiment (2.87 ± 0.13). Cabbage stink bugs in both years of the experiment caused the highest extent of injuries on the hybrids 'Destiny F1', 'Cheers F1', and 'Vestri F1'. In both years we found higher epicuticular wax content in red cabbage genotypes. In almost all studied genotypes we found a pronounced negative correlation between the content of epicuticular wax and the extent of injuries done by both groups of harmful pests. We have established that epicuticular wax is an important factor of cabbage's antixenotic resistance to attacks by cabbage flea beetles and cabbage stink bugs, and that the cabbage genotypes with higher content of this substance are consequently more suitable for environmentally acceptable manners of cabbage production.",

    "abstract": "Sugarcane management systems affect soil attributes such as the carbon cycle. This fact has stimulated the sugar and alcohol industry to refine the sugarcane production systems by replacing the pre-harvest burning (PB) and manual harvest with mechanized harvesting followed by residue deposition. The aim of this study was to evaluate different management systems with respect to C cycling carbon dioxide and soil parameters (chemical, physical and biological) which were determined over the season. Three sugarcane cultivation systems were evaluated at the following periods: (a) PB, (b) 5-year green harvest and (c) 10-year green harvest. The results indicated that CO2 emission was 36% greater in the 10-year sugarcane green harvest system than in the PB system. The bulk density and macroporosity were the factors that were most affected by the different sugarcane management systems and that significantly influenced soil CO2 emissions. The principal component analysis showed that soil CO2 emission was 18% influenced by base saturation (V%) and 14% by pH, especially in the PB area. Additionally, 19% was affected by carbon and macroporosity in the 5- and 10-year green harvest areas, respectively. From our results, it can be concluded that the most CO2 emissions are in the areas of sugarcane green, this is due to the higher carbon concentration when compared with the area of burning sugarcane. The parameters that most influenced the CO2 emissions were bulk density, porosity, macroporosity, pH and V%.",

    "abstract": "A meta-analysis of 297 treatment data from the Vezaiciai Branch of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry long-term field experiment published from 2006 to 2015 was used to characterize the changes in SOC under different fertilization treatments and residue management practices in Lithuania's acid soil. A meta-analysis was performed to quantify the relative annual change (RAC) of SOC content and the average RAC rate of SOC under four fertilization modes (farmyard manure (FYM) (40 t ha−1)); alternative organic fertilizers (in the manure background (40 t ha−1)); FYM (60 t ha−1); alternative organic fertilizers (in the manure background (60 t ha−1)) in two soil backgrounds (naturally acid and limed soil). The average RAC under four fertilization modes was 1.46 g kg−1 yr−1, indicating that long-term fertilization had considerable SOC sequestration potential. Incorporation of alternative organic fertilizers in unlimed soil showed negative effects (−0.39 and −0.66 g kg−1 yr−1) in the observed long-term experiment. The RAC in the limed soil with incorporated organic fertilizers (FYM and alternative organic fertilizers), compared to the control, and varied from 0.25 g kg−1 yr−1 in the treatment with incorporated alternative organic fertilizers (in the manure background (40 t ha−1)) to 0.71 g kg−1 yr−1 in the soil with FYM (60 t ha−1). In this study, the average RAC rate of SOC under organic fertilization treatments in limed soil (5.07–6.54%) was longer than organic fertilization in unlimed soil (2.11–3.49%), which might be attributed to the application of organic manure that would result in a slow release of fertilizer efficiency. Our results indicate that the application of manure (40 or 60 t ha−1) showed the greatest potential for C sequestration in agricultural soil and produced the longest SOC sequestration duration.",

The aqueous methanol extracts of mango leaves inhibited seedling growth of garden cress, radish, rapeseed, foxtail fescue and crabgrass, and the inhibitory effects increased with the increasing extract concentration, suggesting that mango leaves may contain allelopathic substances. The extract was then purified by several chromatographic runs through a bioassay-directed fractionation, and an growth inhibitory substance was isolated and identified by spectral data as methyl-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (methyl gallate). Methyl gallate at the concentration of 10 mM inhibited 98.6% and 99.8% of root and shoot growth of garden cress relative to the control, respectively, and 94.4% and 49.3% of those of foxtail fescue, respectively. The concentrations of methyl gallate required for 50% growth inhibition (I50) on garden cress roots and shoots were 3.9 and 3.3 mM, and those on foxtail fescue roots and shoots were 1.5 and 9.5 mM, respectively. It is the first report of an allelopathic substance in mango leaves and allelopathic activity of methyl gallate. Therefore, the mango leaves may have potential as a soil additive material for the weed management options.",

Both models used for assessment of latency period duration on cv. Turnia and cv. Ostroga performed well. The influence of climate changes on leaf rust latency period was then simulated using meteorological data from three weather stations located in western Poland and virtual data obtained after transformation of the recorded data to reflect a temperature changes under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios according to giss_e2_r climate model. The study shows that without mitigation of greenhouse gas emission latency period of wheat leaf rust is going to decrease which may result in increase of wheat leaf rust incidence.",

This study aims to construct an optimal estimation model of winter wheat leaf moisture content (LMC) through spectral data processing and feature band selection. LMC and spectral reflectance were measured in 2017-2018 to construct models using simple linear regression (SLR), principal components regression (PCR), and partial least square regression (PLSR); feature bands for modelling were selected through correlation analysis and the effects of feature band number on estimation accuracy were compared. The results showed that data transformation significantly enhanced the correlation between spectral features and LMC. However, the band position corresponding to the maximum correlation coefficient for each transformation was not fixed. The accuracy of PLSR models were significantly higher than that of PCR and SLR models. The comparison of relative percent deviation (RPD) values indicated that the RPD values increased rapidly and then tended to be stable with the increase of feature band number. The R′′ -PLSR model constructed with 28 feature bands (R2c = 0.8517; RPD > 2.0) estimated the LMC more accurately than other models. This study provides a good method for non-destructive monitoring of crop moisture content.",

    "abstract": "There is a need both in organic farming and on farms using integrated pest management for non-chemical measures that control the perennial weed flora. The effect of mechanical weeding and fertilisation on perennial weeds, fungal diseases and soil structure were evaluated in two different experiments in spring cereals. Experiment I included six strategies. The first strategy was (1) without specific measures against perennial weeds. The other strategies encompassed one or two seasonal control measures; (2) rhizome/root cutting with minimal soil disturbance in autumn, (3) hoeing with 24 cm row spacing, (4) combined hoeing and disc harrowing in autumn, (5) ‘KvikUp’ harrowing in spring, and (6) ‘KvikUp’ harrowing in spring and autumn. Experiment II included factor (i) inter-row hoeing and (ii) fertilisation level. This experiment included the comparison between normal row spacing (12 cm) with weed harrowing versus double row spacing (=24 cm) in combination with inter-row hoeing and 4 fertilisation levels (50–200 kg N ha −1). In experiment I the strategies consisting of no or one direct weed control measure (1, 2, 3 and 5) clearly did not control the perennial weeds. The two seasonal control measures (4 and 6) gave a satisfactory weed control and highest crop yield. The combination of best weed control and no measured harmful effects on soil structure or increase of fungal diseases may explain the highest yields for these strategies. In Experiment II, hoeing and 24 cm spacing gave less perennial biomass compared to 12 cm spacing. Grain yields increased linearly with increasing nitrogen input. The study shows that both inter-row hoeing and weed harrows, are important elements in integrated pest management practice and organic farming. In addition, our results indicate that efficient mechanical weeding is possible without harmful effects in crop rotation consisting of various spring cereals as regards soil structure and plant health.",

Within the Ocimum genus there occur about 200 species in different varieties and forms. A pot experiment was performed to better understand salt stress responses in crop plants; we compared the impacts of salinity stress on growth and physio-biochemical characteristics in three varieties of basil (Ocimum basilicum) var. odoratus, O. b. var. alba and O. b. var. purpurascens) grown under four levels of salinity stress (0, 50, 100, and 150 mM NaCl) with mycorrhiza (Glomus clarum Nicol. & Schenck) or without. Results showed significant differences within salinity treatments in all cultivars studied. In this study, the biomass production and physio-biochemical parameters of all cultivars reduced with raised salinity levels except concentration of reducing sugars, sodium, and proline at 150 mM of NaCl, only the variety ‘purpurascens’ didn't show reduction and observed resistant against severe salinity. The colonization of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi enhanced the biomass production and accumulation of nutrients, reducing sugars, total soluble carbohydrates, photosynthetic pigments, proline, and protein by reducing Na. This study should help understand the function of AMF fungi in basil cultivars’ tolerance to salinity stress.",

The genetic and agronomic factors have an impact on the growth, quantity and quality of cereal grain yields, so they can also affect the content of ARs in triticale (Triticosecale Wittmack). The purpose of this research was to determine the impact of production technology on AR content in the grains of four winter triticale varieties cultivated under different cultivation systems. The research was conducted in the years of 2010–2014 at the Experimental Station in Osiny (51°27′N; 22°2′E), Poland. The experiment was located on a lessive soil (Luvisol), on plots sized 45 m2 in four replications. The first factor was cultivation system (tillage and no-tillage) and the second factor was type of production technology (integrated and intensive), which was diversified in terms the doses of mineral fertilizers and the intensity of plant chemical protection. The study indicated that the content of ARs in winter triticale grains is mostly determined genetically but it also depends on weather conditions and production technology. This content is the least dependent on soil cultivation system. The highest AR content was recorded for Fredro variety, while the lowest for Pizarro, 444 and 277 mg kg−1, respectively. Using intensive production technologies favored the accumulation of ARs, especially under abundant rainfall during the tillering, at the beginning of shooting and earring, as well as under limited rainfall during plant ripening. The production of pro-health food of a high content of ARs would benefit the most from using Fredro variety of winter triticale, cultivated in tillage system under intensive production technology.",

High annual forage yield of legume–grass mixtures can be obtained with proper selection of species and an appropriate legume–grass ratio.

The mixtures and legume pure stands achieved better forage production both per cutting and on the annual basis and had better forage quality than grass pure stands.",

Five sweet and three bitter cultivars of lupin were selected, respectively, having low- and high-alkaloid content. The contents of the dominant lupine alkaloids in these plants were determined. It was found that the susceptibility of the plants to slug damage is dependent on their content of alkaloids. The plants of high-alkaloid cultivars (Karo, Mirela and Oskar) were less heavily damaged by the studied species of slugs. The greatest differences were recorded for A. vulgaris and D. reticulatum, while the differences for A. rufus were smaller.

In total, 120 soil samples were collected from the 0–20-cm soil layer in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province. Traditional statistical and geostatistical methods were used to analyse the spatial distribution of SOM and STN; a geographical detector (GeoDetector)was used to explore the factors influencing the spatial variation. The SOM and STN concentrations were 6.92–44.57 and 0.52–2.54 g/kg, respectively. The Cokriging interpolation map showed a similar spatial distribution pattern for SOM and STN concentrations, which decreased from the northeast to southwest directions in the study area. GeoDetector results revealed that the three primary factors influencing the spatial variability of SOM and STN were soil type, annual accumulated precipitation and elevation, with their explanatory power ranging between 38.4% and 59.5%. Two-factor interactions enhanced the explanatory power of the spatial variability of SOM and STN. The research results provide a reference for conservation tillage and precision agriculture.",

We also examined whether acidification could increase the effect of BC on SD effectiveness and compared the effects of untreated and acidified BCs with that of sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄). The treatments included unamended SD (SDUT) and SD amended with untreated BC (BCUT), H3PO4-acidified BC, (BCH3PO4) H2SO4-acidified BC (BCH2SO4), or pure H2SO4. These treatments were compared in a pot experiment with ryegrass (Lolium perenne, L.) and evaluated based on N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) taken up by plants and remaining in the soil. The N input to the soil was doubled for all applied amendments compared with SDUT. However, the fertilisation effectiveness of SD amended with BCUT alone was comparable to that of SD treated with pure H₂SO₄, offering the additional benefits of higher C input and reduced C loss from the soil. We concluded that the effect of BC on the effectiveness of SD as a fertiliser is similar to, or even better than, that of H2SO4.",

The advantage of the disk meter was the stability of model parameters from day to day. The advantage of the sward stick is that the readings can be applied directly into practice. None of the methods is reliable enough when precise HM estimates are needed from small-scale experiments, but they are useful in large areas or when HM estimates tolerate larger errors.",

Cracking appeared to be related more to the rate of water uptake than to the total amount of water that was accumulated. The less susceptible cultivars, \"Ulster\" and \"Sam\", appeared to obtain their cracking resistance by displaying a slower rate of water uptake and thereby having a greater period to accumulate the damaging quantities of water prior to cracking rather than by tolerating more water once absorbed. It is evident from this study that cultivaral differences in cracking are closely associated with indirect effects that the fruit osmotic potential and skin permeability have on the rates of water accumulation. Fruit from the more cracking-susceptible cultivar \"Van\" on F.12/1 rootstock accumulated more water and underwent more cracking than fruit from Colt rootstock. Fruit moisture content, fruit transpiration rates, fruit size and firmness, however, failed to help explain the cultivar difference in cracking propensity.",

K-Deficiency and water stress reduced the starch content of boiled potatoes, for K from 77 to 62% in DM. S-Deficiency increased total dietary fibre (TDF), from about 7.7 to 9.5%. Water stress, N-application and P-, K-, Ca- and S-deficiency increased total- and NO3-N concentrations, which varied from 0.88 to 3.73% and from 14 to 230 ppm in DM. S-Applications increased total-S content from 0.06 to 0.15% in DM, of which between 81 and 45% were found in methionine + cystine. Total-N/total-S ratios decreased from 33.5 to 10.8 with S-applications. An N/S ratio of about 13 or less seems necessary for high yield and quality. Increasing N in DM, due to water stress, high N-rates or deficiencies of other nutrients, decreased concentrations in crude protein (CP) of all essential amino acids, whereas aspartic acid (asparagine) in most cases increased. S-Deficiency caused particularly strong decreases in concentrations of essential amino acids, from 1.36 to 0.56, 1.60 to 1.10, 4.93 to 3.88 and 5.41 to 2.86 g/16 g N of cystine, methionine, lysine and leucine, respectively.

In N-balance trials with rats increasing crude protein concentrations in DM of boiled potatoes increased the true digestibility (TD) of the protein from 78 to 89 but decreased the biological value (BV) from 94 to 66. S-Deficiency caused a further reduction of the BV to 55. Excluding S-deficiency treatments, linear regression equations between CP concentrations and BV and TD gave correlation coefficients, r, of −0.90∗∗∗ and 0.89∗∗∗, respectively.

Gunnar) was studied during three growing seasons. Also the interaction of K application and drought during the early grain-filling period was studied. The soil was coarse-textured and low in K content and water holding capacity. Maximum accumulation of K occurred at the end of heading and was 140 to 200 kg/ha at K-level 1 and 210 to 280 kg/ha at K-levels 2 and 3. In the shoot solution, the K concentration increased by increasing K application and varied from 200 to 250 mM in non-maturing plants. The shoot tissue water content also increased by increasing K application and was 5–20% higher at K-level 3 than at K-level 1. At the tillering stage of growth an increasing number of shoots were established by increasing K application, which resulted in a higher number of ears at high K-levels. Differences in the effect of K on shoot initiation were noticed between dry and 'wet' years, as high K application did not increase the number of shoots under the latter conditions. High K application increased the leaf size and the leaf area index (LAI) of the upper leaves, resulting in a larger LAI than at low K application during the grain-filling period and under drought. The specific leaf area (SLA) increased with the level of K application, probably caused by increase of water content and cell size. SLA decreased during a season with high light intensity and increased with low intensity.

The fruit quality was evaluated on juice optical density (OD), titratable acidity (TA), pH, soluble solids content (SSC), ethanol, firmness and flavour. In general, CA had little effect on SSC in the three seasons and did not show any effects in reducing pitting. Controlled atmosphere has shown some beneficial effects on flavour, reducing decay, reducing toughening, and maintaining TA in sweet cherries. Generally, flavour score was higher for fruit kept in CA than for fruit stored in air, and the higher the CO2 the better the taste. 'Van' and 'Sam' showed excellent taste scores after three weeks both from CA and air storage. There was very little ethanol accumulation in the fruits under CA, and it was well below the detrimental level.

In 1998, unsprayed control and hand-thinned 'Victoria' trees were compared with trees treated at full bloom with a single application of 1% Armothin® or 1.5% ammonium thiosulphate (ATS). The same programme was conducted in the following two years with the addition of a single full bloom treatment with 250 ppm ethephon and a post-bloom application one month after full bloom with the mixture 10 ppm 1-napththalene acetic acid (NAA) and 75 ppm ethephon. High volume sprays were conducted the first two years and low volume the last year. Thinning trials testing 1–1.5% ATS and 5–7% lime sulphur in comparison with unthinned and hand-thinned trees to the cultivars 'Opal' and 'Victoria' were conducted in 2000, at growers' sites. Generally, thinning treatments reduced crop load and enhanced fruit quality (fruit size, soluble solid content, fruit firmness and ground and surface colour), but the results varied from year to year. Fruit set was reduced to about half of control values and the percentage of class 1 fruits was doubled compared to the control trees. High volume sprays to running off were more effective than low volume sprays. The cultivar 'Opal' was more sensitive to ATS than 'Victoria' and a low dosage is recommended. All thinning compounds caused some minor leaf injury but no fruit damage. The flower thinners were efficient at rather low temperature. No differences in the amount of gummosis (internal disorder of the fruits) were observed as a result of treatments on 'Victoria' plums. Return bloom was improved by thinning. In conclusion, a single dilute application at full bloom of 1% Armothin®, 1.5% ATS or 250 ppm ethephon or one application of the mixture 10 ppm NAA-75 ppm ethephon four weeks after bloom reduced fruit set and crop load and increased fruit quality and return bloom of the cultivar 'Victoria'. Similar results were achieved with one dilute spray with 1% ATS or 5% lime sulphur at full bloom to the cultivar 'Opal'.",

Wheat shoots were pulse-labelled once with 14CO2 to trace the photosynthetically fixed C within the soil/plant system. Fertilizer N increased root length and canopy water use efficiency (WUE). At each N level, root length and WUE were higher under elevated than under ambient CO2, but no CO2-N interaction was observed. The N concentration in roots, but not in shoots, was affected by a CO2-N interaction. Fertilizer N increased and elevated CO2 decreased shoot N concentrations. The root-to-shoot (R/S) ratio decreased with N addition and was affected by interactions between N and CO2. Plant biomass C and N increased significantly with increased N addition. The effect of elevated CO2 on shoots was relatively small regardless of N level, whereas roots experienced a clear CO2-N interaction. The 14C recovered one week after labelling was mainly in the shoot biomass (80%). The activity increased with N addition, reflecting a larger shoot biomass, but the relative distribution of 14C between shoots, roots, soil and rhizosphere respiration was little affected by CO2 level and N addition. Soil 15N contributed 7.1 to 9.0 g N m−2 to shoot N, the total increase (9.3 to 24.3 g N m−2) being dominated by contributions from fertilizer N. We conclude that effects of elevated CO2 on wheat tissue N cannot be compensated for by N additions, and that plant uptake of native soil N is marginally affected by added N and elevated CO2.",

We applied yield component analysis on four dwarf and 11 traditional (conventional stature) genotypes; an ontogenetic approach was employed to provide the appropriate view of this process. Using the k-means clustering procedure, the genotypes were grouped subject to similar yield structure (i.e., mean values and coefficients of variation of grain yield and its components, first clustering), similar correlation matrices among grain yield and its components (second clustering), and similar results of yield component analysis (third clustering). Based on the analysis, we attempted to provide an overall general view of determining winter triticale grain yield by its components. Thus, we elucidate that the pattern of influencing winter triticale grain yield by its components, as well as the pattern of co-relationships among these traits, cannot be explained by yield structure, and hence these two processes are determined by genotypic factors. The correlation among the traits (grain yield and its components) and the results of yield component analysis, on the other hand, were significantly related in the study, so they have similar genotypic sources.",

    "abstract": "The restoration of the physical structure of soil by plant roots depends on the ability of roots to penetrate strong soil. The sensitivity of root growth to mechanical impedance can be considered as a possible screen for species suitable as 'biological subsoilers'. The ability of roots to penetrate hard wax layers in sand cores has recently been identified as a useful tool for identifying rice varieties that are good at penetrating strong soil, and this method provides the possibility of a rapid laboratory screen which can be used to identify other species with the same characteristic. However, comparing plants with very different root anatomy may be more difficult than comparing the performance of root systems that are essentially similar, except for the number and length of roots, as is the case with rice. In this paper, we compare the penetration of roots of barley, chicory, lupin, red clover and lucerne through soft and hard wax layers installed at 50 mm depth in sand columns. Barley had the lowest fraction of roots that penetrated the hard wax layer, although it had a higher absolute number of roots penetrating the hard wax than the other species. The numbers of chicory, lupin, red clover and lucerne roots penetrating the hard wax layer were similar, although lucerne had the highest number. The proportion of roots penetrating the hard layer as a proportion of those penetrating the soft layer was highest for lucerne. Comparison with previous data for barley and lucerne supports the use of the wax layer screen for identifying species with good root penetration.",

Plant morphology, green biomass production, and dry matter content were evaluated. Studies revealed that S. trifoliatum is easy to cultivate and up to 28.8 t/ha of biomass dry weight, on average, could be achieved. Thus, the plant could be potentially utilized for various purposes. Determinations of secondary metabolite contents (essential oil, flavonoids, oleanosides, and phenolic acids) were carried out using leaves, inflorescences, and rhizomes of Silphium trifoliatum during the ontogenesis stage. It was found that the plant's rhizomes contained the highest level of essential oils (up to 0.46% v/w), and thus, they are the most promising raw material. Leaves contained the highest level of flavonoids (up to 0.90%). However, oleanosides were present in greatest abundance in leaves at the budding stage (6.02%). Inflorescences were characterized by the largest amounts of phenolic acids (up to 52.73 mg/100 g DM, in total). It was also found that caffeic acid was the dominant phenolic acid in S. trifoliatum. The optimum date of harvest was the period just before flowering.",

Phosphorus seed coating resulted in alteration to plant stand structure traits. Despite the fact that seedling emergence sometimes decreased, the number of total and productive stems, number of grains per ear and 1000-grain weight increased. The positive effect of P seed coating on grain yield was revealed when the growth conditions during post-anthesis were favourable for exploiting the potential that was obtained during the pre-anthesis phase. In our experiment favourable conditions were considered those that generated a grain yield over 6 t ha−1. According to path coefficients analyses the significant positive effect of P seed coating on malting barley yield increase was related to seed weight increase. Although P seed coating slightly increased single grain N concentration and thus grain protein concentration, grain protein concentration ranged from 8.6% to 10.2% and met the quality standard requirements for malting barley in all trials and treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To gain information about how widening of the row distance influences seed yields in first-year perennial ryegrass, experiments with four row distances in three types of perennial ryegrass were conducted at the University of Aarhus, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences. Perennial ryegrass was undersown at 12-, 24-, 36-, or 48-cm row distance in a cover crop of spring barley. The seeding rate in perennial ryegrass was 6 kg seeds ha−1 regardless of row distance. Although increasing the row distance from 12 to 48 cm had a negative effect on the yield component number of reproductive tillers, the yield was not affected in the first-year seed production in three perennial ryegrass cultivars. Regardless of row distance the seed rate was 6 kg ha−1 and hence in-row plant density in autumn and spring was higher at 48 compared with 12 cm; however, in all three cultivars the highest number of reproductive tillers was recorded at 12-cm row distance. Row distance affected seed yields of only the diploid amenity cultivar 'Allegro', where a row distance of 48 cm reduced the seed yield compared with 12- and 24-cm row distance. When data from the three cultivars were merged there was a positive correlation between the seed yield and seed weight (r=0.72***), whereas the correlation between seed yield and the number of reproductive tillers was negatively correlated (r= − 0.49***). This may reflect choice of cultivars in the experiment with the tetraploid forage cultivar 'Tivoli' having the lowest number of reproductive tillers, highest seed weight, and highest seed yield, and the diploid amenity cultivar 'Allegro' having the highest number of reproductive tillers, lowest seed weight, and the lowest seed yield. When the three cultivars were merged, there was a positive and highly significant correlation between seed weight and seed yield (r=0.72***). In contrast, there was no correlation between seed weight and seed yield when data were analysed for the individual cultivars. This suggests a cultivar-dependent relationship between seed weight and seed yield and furthermore between number of reproductive tillers and seed yield.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growth and development of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) are under the influence of complex environmental factors. Understanding of the growth responses of the groundnut to environmental factors may improve the application of better management practices and develop better cultivars to overcome the problems causing reductions in yield. A two-year field experiment was conducted to determine the growth and development response of groundnut genotypes to environmental factors in the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey in 2001 and 2002. Time from sowing to physiological maturity (R8) ranged from 2513°Cd to 2588°Cd in 2001 and from 2514°Cd to 2573°Cd in 2002 while total calendar days varied between 147 and 153 and between 156 and 161 depending on genotypes in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Dry matter accumulation in each part of the plants continued until maturity although accumulation rate differed depending on plant age. Combination of suitable temperature and photoperiod during the reproductive stages resulted in continuous and abundant reproductive plant parts, which led to delayed harvest and increased unmarketable pods. The slower growth rate due to the cooler conditions during early stages caused slower biomass accumulation in successive stages indicating the importance of initial crop growth for final yield. Therefore, the genotypes having high initial growth rate, less reproductive organs, and shorter growing period should be developed for the Mediterranean conditions by breeders. The management studies should also deal with increased initial growth rate and reduced number of flowers, pegs or pods per plant. Based on our results, groundnut has a great yield potential under the Mediterranean conditions. However, further breeding and management studies are needed to improve the yield and profitability and reduce the complications arisen from the Mediterranean climate.",

Males showed greater attraction to unmated females than to mated females and mated females showed a negative density dependent response with extremely significant repulsion shown when 10 mated females were present. Plants of the susceptible tea cultivar TRI2025 were significantly more attractive to females than those of the less susceptible cultivar TRI2023, although stem extracts of the susceptible cultivar were not found to be attractive to beetles. Beetles were found to be attracted to ethanol and to the known tea volatiles eugenol, hexanol, α- and β-pinene, geraniol, and methyl salicylate. The attraction of the tea volatiles was found to be enhanced when they were mixed with ethanol, indicating that ethanol has a broad synergistic effect. In a study on phagostimulant effects of tea extracts, sugars, and caffeine, the methanol extract of cultivar TRI2025 and the sugars glucose and sucrose were found to be attractive, and caffeine repulsive, to beetles. Pellets containing the extract were found to be preferred over those containing glucose. Beetles were attracted to pellets containing glucose/inositol mixture with glucose:inositol in the 3:1 ratio found in the susceptible cultivar TRI2025, being preferred to the mixture in 5:1 ratio found in stems of the less susceptible cultivar TRI2025. Both volatile and nonvolatile constituents of tea appear to play a role in attracting the female beetle to the plant.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wetlands are an important component of the terrestrial ecosystem, and play a crucial role in sequestering carbon. However, to date, there is little information about the land-use and nitrogen-fertilization effects on temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in wetland. In this investigation, effects of land use and nitrogen fertilization on temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q 10) in a freshwater marsh of northeast China were studied. The results showed that change of land use significantly affected Q 10-value, which followed the order: Intact Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland soil >upland forest soil >abandoned cultivated soil >cultivated soil. Our data confirmed that soil temperature and moisture were important factors affecting Q 10-values. Besides temperature and soil moisture, availability of C and N and microbial activity in soil were important factors affecting Q 10-values. Nitrogen fertilization resulted in an increase in Q 10-value not only in the intact wetland, but also in the cultivated soil. Although availability of N could stimulate temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, high nitrogen fertilization (i.e., 240 kg N ha−1 in this study) inhibited temperature sensitivity. Further studies are indicated as a means of answering these questions and providing additional information on the effects of nitrogen fertilization on Q 10-value.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With focus on maximizing grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production, especially in China, information available in the literature on how nitrogen (N) fertilization of rice crops affects biofortification of iron (Fe) and (Zn) in grains is limited. The objective of the experiment was to investigate to what degree application of N fertilizer attained the optimum Fe and Zn concentration in rice grains as well as grain yield under pot conditions. Two rice cultivars of the indica 'Zhenong 952' and the japonica 'Bing 98110', grown widely in the area of the Yangtse River Delta in southern China, and fertilized with four rates of urea (0, 0.50, 1.00 and 1.50 g N pot−1), were investigated. The results showed that, in the pot trails, the optimum application of N alone on rice crops could increase the concentration of Fe in the polished rice. By considering both health and commercial reasons, when N application reached 1.00 g pot−1, the optimal Fe and Zn concentrations were attained as well as grain yield for 'Zhenong 952', and for 'Bing 98110' the optimum N application was 1.50 g pot−1. Fe appeared not to be so easily mobilized as Zn in the plant. The ratio of Zn deposited in the brown rice was about 40% of total Zn in the plant, irrespective of N application. However, deposited Fe was only about 3% of total Fe. Fe concentration in brown rice was only about ½ that in rice husk, 1/5 that in peduncles, 1/10 that in leaves, and only a little more than 1% of that in roots. These results suggested if we wanted to increase the amount of Fe in grains the translocation mechanism of Fe in rice plant must be clearly understood first.",

Priming, a seed enhancement technique with solid carriers, can be a useful tool for improving germination characteristics of switchgrass seeds. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of priming on three non-aged and aged switchgrass cultivars of ‘Cave in rock’ ‘Dacotah’, and ‘Kanlow’. Seeds were primed with a synthetic calcium silicate (MicroCel E) and water at 30°C for five days. Seed, carrier and water proportions were 1 g, 0.5 g, and 1.5 mL, respectively. There was a 5% point (pp, Cave in rock), 8 pp (Dacotah), and 19 pp (Kanlow) increase in primed seeds compared with non-treated control seeds. Furthermore, priming decreased mean germination time by 26–36% in all seeds compared with the non-treated control. Accelerated aging was induced by storing seeds for 0, 10, and 21 days at 42°C and 95% relative humidity (RH). Germination percentage decreased and mean germination time increased with the aging. These results suggest that priming is an effective technique to improve the performance of switchgrass cultivars.",

To document the responses of winter cereals grown under cold conditions at northern latitudes, autumn growth of winter wheat exposed to ambient and elevated levels of temperature (+2.5°C), CO2 (+150 µmol mol−1), and shade (−30%) was studied in open-top chambers under low light and at low temperatures. Throughout the experiment, temperature dominated plant responses, while the effects of CO2 were marginal, except for a positive effect on root biomass. Increased temperature resulted in increased leaf area, total biomass, total root biomass, total stem biomass, and number of tillers, but also a lower content of total sugars and a weaker tolerance to frost. The loss of frost tolerance was related to the larger size of plants grown at elevated temperature. The 30% light reduction under shading did not affect the growth, sugar content, or frost tolerance of winter wheat. At the low temperatures found at high latitudes during autumn, the atmospheric CO2 increase is unlikely to enhance autumn growth of winter wheat to any significant extent, while a temperature increase may have important and major effects on its development and growth.",

Seeds from three populations were harvested from the mother plants and sown in pots buried in an experimental field, either in late autumn or after winter storage at outdoor temperatures. Seeds were sown on the soil surface or covered by a 2-cm soil layer. In addition, some of the seeds sown in autumn were also subjected to mechanical disturbance in autumn or in spring. Population and soil cover both had a strong effect on total emergence. The light requirement of the species for germination was indicated by a higher rate of emergence from seeds sown on the soil surface than from covered seeds. Sowing date influenced the timing of emergence but not the total emergence. Autumn sowing led to earlier and more concentrated emergence, while seedlings from spring-sown seeds showed a more intermittent emergence pattern. Stirring after sowing had a positive effect on emergence compared with emergence from undisturbed, covered seeds. In all populations and treatments, emergence continued throughout the growing season, contradicting earlier findings that R. crispus seeds germinate mainly in early spring and autumn, and enter secondary dormancy during summer. The delay of emergence in seeds that had remained on the mother plant over winter indicates a certain level of dormancy, which was gradually broken in early summer.",

The inclusion of autumn harrowing increased these figures to 94 and 98%, respectively. Over the last six years, spring ploughing gave 5% lower yield than did autumn ploughing. Relative yields of unploughed versus ploughed treatments were negatively correlated with summer rainfall. Grain protein was lowest with spring harrowing only. In trial 2, on clay loam, direct drilling has since 1998, as in previous years, given around 10% lower yield than has autumn ploughing. Autumn harrowing gave 4% lower yield in winter wheat and 6% higher yield in spring oats than did autumn ploughing, whilst yields of spring turnip rape were not significantly affected by tillage. In trial 3, also on clay loam, six alternative straw treatments were compared under four unploughed tillage regimes. Relative to straw removal, retaining large residue amounts depressed yields hardly at all with autumn and spring harrowing, but by 7% with spring harrowing only and by 13% with direct drilling. Overall, direct drilling gave 18% lower yields in this trial than did autumn and spring harrowing, whilst the yield reduction with spring harrowing only was 7%. In trial 4, on silt loam, both spring harrowing only and direct drilling have since 1998 given 6% lower yield than has autumn ploughing, whereas autumn and spring harrowing has given 6% higher yield. Under drier conditions during 1991–1997, autumn ploughing gave up to 11% lower yield than did unploughed treatments.

The response of five parental genotypes and their F1 hybrids to a phoma black stem isolate (MA6) were evaluated in a diallel programme under controlled growth chamber conditions. Significant GCA and SCA indicate that both additive and non-additive gene effects contributed in the inheritance of partial resistance to phoma black stem, however, the Baker ratio showed that the additive genetic effects were more important than nonadditive ones. It is recommended that the GGEbiplot methodology could be an excellent tool for visualizing entry by tester (diallel) data. By using this technique to analyse black stem severity data, interaction among the sunflower genotypes in providing partial resistance to phoma black stem was clearly identified. Based on GGEbiplot presentation and Griffing's diallel analysis, the mutant line ‘M6-54-1’ showed the largest GCA, indicating contribution towards partial resistance, and the genotype B454/03 presented the smallest GCA, indicating contribution towards susceptibility. Our results show that the F1 hybrids ‘SDR18×B454/03’ and ‘M6-54-1×B454/03’ showing heterosis for partial resistance to phoma black stem come from the crosses between a susceptible genotype ‘B454/03’ and two partially resistant genotypes (SDR18 and M6-54-1), originated from different breeding programmes. We conclude therefore that these genotypes possess at least some different resistance genes, which were expressed in the hybrids and led to the observed effects.",

Cotton plants grown in pots with three N levels (0, 4.5, and 9.0 g N pot−1, equivalent to 0, 240, and 480 kg N ha−1, respectively) were subjected to waterlogging for eight days and then permitted to recover for fifteen days. The dry weights of root and shoot were decreased by waterlogging, and were highest at 240 kg N ha−1. In waterlogged root, the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase decreased and that of peroxidase increased in comparison with the control. The application of N increased the activities of catalase and peroxidase of both waterlogged root and the control, but decreased superoxide dismutase activity. Malondialdehyde content, an indicator of membrane lipid peroxidation, was significantly increased, and was lowest in the 240 kg N ha−1 N treatment during waterlogging. Both root vigor and canopy apparent photosynthesis rate, which were weakened by waterlogging, reached a peak at 240 kg N ha−1. At the 15th day after termination of waterlogging, N application promoted root vigor and canopy apparent photosynthesis rate of waterlogged cotton plants. These results indicated that an appropriate N supply (240 kg N ha−1) may contribute to waterlogging resistance of cotton by adjusting the antioxidant enzyme activities of root, reducing lipid peroxidation and boosting root vigor; however, excessive N supply (480 kg N ha−1) may lead to an adverse impact on waterlogging resistance of cotton. Therefore, the application of N should be reduced to decrease stress when waterlogging occurs, and additional N fertilizer may be used to promote cotton growth after waterlogging.",

The malting barley cultivar Supi 3 was planted during the growing seasons 2005 and 2006 at two contrasting sites in China. Five nitrogen (N) application rates (0, 75, 150, 225 and 300 kg ha−1) were applied for research of effects of N rates application on grain yield, protein content and N use efficiency. At both sites and in both years, grain yield increased with increasing N application rates up to 225 kg N ha−1, and decreased with 300 kg N ha−1. Net photosynthetic rate (P N) and the amount of accumulated dry matter distributed into grains showed the same response to N application as grain yield. Grain protein content increased with increasing N application rates. Moreover, based on further analysis of these results with a quadrant model, the optimum N application rates for high grain yield with high nitrogen use efficiency in malting barley could be indicated. So, the higher yields could be mainly ascribed to the higher accumulation of photoassimilates between anthesis and maturity. In order to achieve high grain yield and quality of malting barley in China farmers are recommended to fertilize with 150–209 kg N ha−1.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between soil physical characteristics and earthworms in a regional-scale field study in Denmark. The earthworm populations along within-field gradients in soil texture were quantified at five field sites, representing dominant soil types of Denmark. Eleven earthworm species were found, but populations were mainly dominated by Aporrectodea tuberculata and A. longa. Despite considerable variation in soil parameters across the five study sites the results suggest that the biomass of anecic worms (or A. longa as a species) was not causally associated with the soil parameters studied. This indicates that there must be other causal factors associated with the abundance (and composition) of anecic worms that are not among the soil texture and structure parameters studied. On the other hand, soil texture (Coarse sand) was associated with the abundance of the dominant endogeic species, A. tuberculata, but not endogeic worms in general. It was hypothesized that anecic and endogeic earthworms might respond to local soil water characteristics rather than soil texture, but this hypothesis could not be confirmed with the present data.",

In order to determine a measuring time-window which can represent the daily average soil CO2 efflux rate from a Black soil in north-east China, soil CO2 efflux rates from no-tillage (NT) and mouldboard plough tillage (MP) plots were measured at a 2-h interval over 48 h four times in the growing season of 2008. Results showed that during the course of measurements, NT soil had a higher soil CO2 efflux rate than MP soil. Daily average soil CO2 efflux rate was matched relatively well with the CO2 efflux rate occurring between 09:00 h and 13:00 h, and between 19:00 h and 23:00 h. Our results indicate that the soil CO2 efflux rate measured between 09:00 and 11:00 h represents the daily average soil CO2 efflux rate during sunny days. When the measurements were conducted outside this time window, a procedure to adjust the CO2 efflux rates measured between 07:00 and 21:00 h (outside of the optimum time-window) to estimate daily average soil CO2 efflux rate is described.",

Hence, to explore the allelopathy of both plants, the aqueous methanol extracts of their leaves were examined at five different concentrations (3-, 10-, 30-, 100-, and 300-mg dry weight [DW] equivalent extract/mL) on the seedling growth of cress, lettuce, alfalfa, Italian ryegrass, barnyard grass, and crabgrass, and on the germination of cress and barnyard grass. The bioassay experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications. The inhibitory activities of both extracts depends on the concentration and test plant species. Considering the I50 values, the seedling growth of lettuce was most sensitive to both extracts and barnyard grass was least sensitive. At concentration of 300-mg DW equivalent extract/mL, R. communis completely inhibited the germination of both cress and barnyard grass, and the seedling growth of cress, lettuce, Italian ryegrass, and barnyard grass. At the same concentration, complete inhibition on the germination of cress and the seedling growth of lettuce and alfalfa was only observed by J. curcas extracts. These results suggest that both plants have allelopathic properties and may possess allelochemicals. Since R. communis extracts had greater activity than J. curcas against the major crop weeds, this plant could be the best candidate for isolation and identification of allelochemicals, which might promote the discovery of new natural herbicides for sustainable agriculture.",

A relationship between polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and forage quality has not been established. Our objective was to investigate seasonal, site, genotype, and management effects on specific PPO activity in RC in three experiments under field conditions, and relate the activity to forage-quality parameters. In Experiment 1, six RC genotypes at two study sites were submitted to a 3-cut system. Specific PPO activity, forage quality, and vegetation stage were determined. PPO activity varied between harvest and study sites, with genotypes differing up to 3-fold in PPO activity within harvests. The specific PPO activity, forage quality, and vegetation stage in RC subjected to 5-cut system and grazing (Experiment 2) were determined. Additionally, in Experiment 3, cutting frequency in RC swards including mechanical stress (rolling) was investigated. The induction of PPO activity in RC by grazing or mechanical stress (Experiments 2 and 3) increased the activity up to 2.5-fold compared with RC at similar vegetation stage submitted to the 5-cut system. Mechanical stress induced by grazing or rolling, and seasonal differences, seem to have a larger influence on specific PPO activity than does the genotype effect observed in Experiment 1. For forage quality, an increased specific PPO activity explained 29–46% of the reduction in protein fraction ‘A’ content (non-protein N) in the cutting systems in Experiments 2 and 3. Other CP fractions achieved a lower relation. Furthermore, the precipitation-to-temperature ratio preceeding a harvest explained 63% of the variation in the specific PPO activity. In conclusion, the PPO activity in RC is induced by grazing and rolling. Whereas weather conditions preceeding a harvest showed a large influence, genotype influence had only minor relevance. These results may have implications for regional harvest management towards efficient N utilization by ruminants.",

    "abstract": "The scarcity of good-quality water is forcing the use of brackish water for irrigation in many areas around the world. Alternate fresh- and brackish water irrigation is a feasible irrigation method (IM). A pot experiment was carried out with three brackish water IMs and at three levels (1, 3 and 5 g NaCl L−1). The various levels of brackish waters were irrigated at the seedling stage, the jointing and tasseling stage and the after tasseling stage, respectively. The responses of maize (Zea mays L.) to alternate irrigation were investigated through gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence. The results showed that the alternate use of fresh- and brackish water reduced the increasing soil salinity caused by brackish water irrigation. The changes in net photosynthesis rate (Pn), stomatal conduction (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and chlorophyll content (SPAD) values revealed that maize was more resistant to brackish water at the after tasseling stage. Moreover, significant reductions in maximum quantum yield (Φpo), effective quantum yield of photochemical energy conversion (Φ2), photochemical quenching (qp), non-photochemical quenching of variable chlorophyll fluorescence (qN) and non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching (NPQ) of photosystem II, grain yield and biomass weight of maize subjected to high NaCl level brackish water at the jointing and tasseling stage were observed. This implied that maize plants were extremely sensitive to brackish water irrigation during the jointing and tasseling stage, and freshwater should be applied at this growth period. Our results would be helpful for sustainable maize production using alternate irrigation with fresh- and brackish water in arid and semi-arid areas.",

The movement of N through the plant-soil system was traced using 15N-labeled urea. The study consisted of twelve treatments, including two irrigation amounts (405 and 540 mm, I405 and I540, respectively); two N application rates (240 and 360 kg N/ha, N240 and N360, respectively); and three irrigation water salinity levels [0.35, 4.61 and 8.04 dS/m, representing fresh water (FW), brackish water (BW), and saline water (SW), respectively]. A randomized complete block design was used with three replications. The results showed that cotton biomass, N uptake, and yield increased as irrigation amount and N amount increased; however, all three variables were significantly less in SW than in FW and BW. Plant 15N recovery rates were greater (i) in the I540 treatments than in the I405 treatments and (ii) in the N360 treatments than in the N240 treatments. Plant 15N recovery rates in BW were 7.98% and 30.01% greater than those in FW and SW, respectively. Residual soil 15N increased as N fertilizer amount increased but declined as irrigation amount increased. Residual soil 15N in BW and SW was 6.02% and 21.44% greater, respectively, than in FW. Total 15N recovery was significant greater in BW than in FW and SW. The 15N leaching losses increased significantly with increases in irrigation amount, irrigation water salinity, and N rate. Our study suggests that if appropriate amounts of irrigation water and N fertilizer are used, then brackish irrigation water (4.61 dS/m) will not affect cotton growth, yield and N recovery. In contrast, saline irrigation water (EC > 8 dS/m) reduces cotton growth, yield, and N use efficiency.",

The results indicated that the highest percentage of mortality of first instar nymph of the citrus cottony scale was observed in the Dayabon treatment of 9 and 10 ml/L, 100.0% ± 0.0% and the lowest percentage was observed in Palizin treatment of 1.5 ml/L, 34.7% ± 2.9%. In the second instar nymph, the highest mortality was seen in the Dursban treatment of 2 ml/L, 94.7% ± 2.4% and the lowest mortality in the Palizin treatment of 1.5 ml/L, 30.0% ± 2.3%. Also, for overwintering adults Dayabon 10 ml/L caused the highest mortality, 96.0% ± 4.0% during 24 h. In the case of ladybird insects, the highest and lowest percentage of mortality was observed in the Dursban treatment of 2 ml/L, 76.7% ± 8.8%, Dayabon 5 ml/L, and Palizin 2 ml/L, 3.3% ± 3.3%, respectively.

The enzymes, rhodanese and arylsulphatase, take part in transforming sulphur in soil.Material and methodsThe seaweed biostimulant Kelpak (auxins 11 mg l-1 and cytokinins 0.031 mg l-1) was applied to increase the uptake and accumulation of sulphur affecting the yield of oilseed rape cv. 'Chagall'. Field experiments were conducted in Poland (53°N.18°E), in Alfisol (USDA) over 2010–2013. In the experiment, the nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus rate applied was as follows: high: 180 N, 70 P, 132 K [kg ha-1] or low: 144 N, 35 P, 66 K [kg ha-1], fertilization rate with elemental S (36 or 0 kg ha-1) and with biostimulant (Kelpak 2 l ha-1 in autumn and 2 l ha-1 in spring) or without it.ResultsThere was found no relevant effect of biostimulant on the activity of the enzymes studied. With a low sulphates content in soil during ripening the rape, the activity of arylsulphatase increases. The highest rate of NPK resulted in a 27-42% increase in the content of SO42− in soil as compared with the soil sampled from NPK fertilization at lower rates. Sulphur recovery efficiency from fertilizer with S elemental increased for higher NPK fertilization.ConclusionsBiostimulant application can compensate for a low level of oilseed rape crops cultivation technology (low rates of NPK fertilization) by improving the use of S from a fertilizer. In growing oilseed rape, it is essential to correlate the management of NPK and S fertilization at the right rate for a high sulphur recovery efficiency.",

PM and SS were applied at 50 and 150 kg/ha nitrogen equivalent fertilizer doses. Biomass production levels in the organic and mineral treatments were similar, except for the SS-50 for FL0 and the PM-150 for Ar40, FL40 and FL0. Biomass production levels of Ar40 were higher than those of Ar0 for the first cycle. In the initial state, the soil P content in Ar40 was higher than that of the Ar0 soil. With the treatment repetition, Ar0 showed the same production level as Ar40. For the fluvisols, biomass production levels of FL40 were lower than those of FL0 for the first cycle. Indeed, the initial nitrate content in FL40 was lower than in FL0. The biomass production levels of FL40 were higher than those of FL0 for the following cycles.",

    "abstract": "Measurements on groundwater level and subsurface drain discharge have been carried in a small field-scale catchment from November 2012 to February 2013 in south-western Norway. The main objective of the measurements has been to study the interaction between the subsurface drainage discharge and groundwater level. Different methods were used to analyse the measurements. One method was to study the variation in groundwater level and drain discharge. The measurements showed there were large day to day variations. However, in addition, there were large diurnal variations in both the groundwater level and drain discharge. Also the recession of groundwater level was studied using a two-exponential decay function. During several months the precipitation largely exceeded the long-term precipitation. The measurements showed that drainage system had the capacity to react fast to precipitation-induced rise in groundwater level, resulting in a fast drawdown. The measurements at the small scale field catchment showed that the drainage system is designed and capable to react to high precipitation amounts like those predicted by climate change scenario studies.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of phenolic acids in soil is one of the main problems associated with continuous cropping of peanut. Although laccases secreted by fungi can efficiently transform phenolic acids, there are few reports on the use of these enzymes to bioremediate continuous cropping soil. Food waste and wheat straw are waste products; however, they could be used productively as resources for laccase production by the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambari B3. We cultured Phomopsis liquidambari B3 in medium containing food waste as the main nitrogen source and wheat straw as the main carbon source. In order to study the effects of fermentation liquid on phenolic acid degradation, rhizosphere soil microbial communities and peanut seedling growth, the fermentation product, which had high laccase activity, was added to continuously cropped soil of peanut. The concentration of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and coumaric acid in soil had decreased by 57.4, 52.5, and 49.4%, respectively, compared with no-treatment control during 28 days. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles showed that the bacterial and fungal community structures in rhizosphere soil were affected by changes in the phenolic acids concentration. The biomass of peanut plants and the number of root nodules were increased 68.3% and 5.9-fold, respectively. These results showed that the laccase product reduced the accumulation of phenolic acids in soil, the decrease in phenolic acids concentration and the increase in certain dominant microorganisms promoted peanut seedling growth and nodulation. This technology provides a new strategy for bioremediation of continuous cropping soil, while simultaneously reducing waste and protecting the environment.",

A field experiment was designed as split-blocks with three replicates. Residue mass, straw mass as well as N, P, K, Ca and Mg amounts were determined in the residues and straw. The residue amount of spring triticale was the greatest. N, Ca and Mg amounts in the residues of spring triticale/field pea mixtures were similar or higher whereas P and K amounts were similar or lower compared with spring triticale residues. Spring triticale straw contained less N, P, Ca and Mg than the straw of either field pea or spring triticale/field pea mixtures. Grain yield, yield components, N content and N uptake in the grain of winter wheat following field pea and spring triticale/field pea mixtures were significantly higher compared with winter wheat following spring triticale. Increasing proportions of field pea in mixtures with spring triticale cultivated as previous crops significantly increased winter wheat grain yields as well as N content and uptake. The residues of the previous crops combined with the straw significantly increased winter wheat grain yield, number of ears per m2, number of grains in an ear, thousand-grain weight and N content and uptake. The highest winter wheat grain yield and N uptake were determined following an application of residues and straw of field pea and 25+75% spring triticale/field pea mixture. The grain of winter wheat after field pea had the greatest N content.",

Forty-three alleles were scored at 20 SSR loci. The average number of alleles per locus (na) and the effective allele number (ne) were 2.15 and 1.72, respectively. Observed heterozygosity (0.55) was higher than the expected (0.38) indicating lack of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The genetic similarity matrix for individuals was constructed using Kosman and Leonard similarity coefficient, and Nei's Genetic Identity as well as Kosman's genetic distance was calculated among populations. Dendrograms were constructed by the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) algorithm. The analysis of molecular variance revealed lower genetic variation among populations (14%), than within populations (86%). The average number of migrants (Nm) between populations based on AMOVA (Fst = 0.062) was 4.79. Results displayed high variation among individual plants, possibly because of the high allogamy. Genetic similarity between populations in this study could be considered as consequences of genetic equilibrium that has occurred over the long period of cultivation of confectionery sunflower in this region as well as seed exchange among provinces. The traditional assumption that selecting genotypes of different geographical origin will maximize the diversity available to a breeding project does not hold in confectionery sunflower.",

Ψ (MPa) were estimated at 10-day intervals between July 10 and September 30, 2008 by using a Scholander pressure bomb, and were monitored in five different plants per species at 06:00 h (predawn) and 14:00 h (midday). Air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and soil water content were registered throughout. Data were subjected to one-way ANOVA and linear correlation analysis. At the wettest period, Ψ at predawn varied from − 0.29 (C. pallida and E. texana) to − 0.37 (F. angustifolia and Z. fagara); in contrast, at the driest period, predawn Ψ ranged from − 3.28 (F. angustifolia) to − 4.50 (Z. fagara). At midday E. texana achieved the highest (−1.14) and lowest (−4.20) values at wettest and driest sampling dates, respectively. It seems that air temperature and vapor pressure deficit negatively influenced Ψ values in all species; conversely, Ψ values augmented as relative humidity increased. Since F. angustifolia and C. pallida maintained higher predawn and midday Ψ values under water stress, these species may be considered as drought-adapted species while, Z. fagara and E. texana that acquired lower values, may be less adapted to drought and in physiological disadvantage under limited water conditions.",

The architecture of the system is built around a mobile roboticunit. The internet based architecture of the system includes a station unit that works as a mobileon-farm operating console, the mobile robotic unit, and a field server for generating and storingmaps. The hypothesis is that it is possible to automate the planning and execution of theoperation of monitoring of the in-field weed density and species distribution. The developedplanning system includes the automatic field geometrical representation and the route planningfor the mobile unit. For the field representation two algorithmic approaches for automated trackgeneration were used. For the route planning, a graph-based field coverage algorithm and adiscrete grid-based path planning method were used.The low computational requirements of the implemented algorithms make it feasible to adopt areal-time re-planning strategy in which a set of new planning problems are solved based on thelatest information. The central part of such a planning, concerns the dynamic re-evaluation of theinitial plan for sampling and routing based on the on-line analysis of the samples. This providesthe basis for a fully sequential adaptive adjustment of the sampling procedure after eachindividual sampling. It is expected that such a dynamic targeted sampling and routing systemwill reduce the overall cost and time consumption of the weed monitoring operation.Key words: autonomous vehicles, farm management, mission planning, route planning,sampling.",

For this purpose, a bacterial isolate, Bacillus thuringiensis CR-371, and an actinomyces isolate, Streptomyces avermectinius NBRC14893, were examined for their ability to protect tomato from root-knot nematode and bacterial wilt diseases under glasshouse conditions. Treatment of tomato roots with B. thuringiensis CR-371 and S. avermectinius NBRC14893 followed by challenge inoculation with R. solanacearum and M. incognita significantly decreased disease severity of bacterial wilt alone, root-knot nematode alone, or mixed infection by both pathogens compared to the control. Furthermore, pretreatment of tomato roots with B. thuringiensis CR-371 and S. avermectinius NBRC14893 significantly reduced bacterial proliferation of R. solanacearum both in pathogen alone inoculated plants and in plants co-inoculated with R. solanacearum and M. incognita. In conclusion, our results suggest that the treatment of tomato roots with B. thuringiensis CR-371 and S. avermectinius NBRC14893 simultaneously suppresses bacterial wilt and root-knot nematode diseases. Therefore, B. thuringiensis CR-371 and S. avermectinius NBRC14893 could provide new options for integrated pest management strategies against plant diseases, especially against bacterial-nematode disease complexes that cause synergistic yield losses.",

    "abstract": "Quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) affect physical, chemical, and biological soil properties, and are pivotal to productive and healthy grasslands. Thus, we analyzed the distribution of soil aggregates and assessed quality, quantity, and distribution of SOM in two unimproved and improved (two organic and two conventional) grasslands in subarctic Iceland, in Haplic and Histic Andosols. We also evaluated principal physicochemical and biological soil properties, which influence soil aggregation and SOM dynamics. Macroaggregates (>250 µm) in topsoils were most prominent in unimproved (62–77%) and organically (58–69%) managed sites, whereas 20–250 µm aggregates were the most prominent in conventionally managed sites (51–53%). Macroaggregate stability in topsoils, measured as mean weight diameter, was approximately twice as high in organically managed (12–20 mm) compared with the conventionally managed (5–8 mm) sites, possibly due to higher organic inputs (e.g., manure, compost, and cattle urine). In unimproved grasslands and one organic site, macroaggregates contributed between 40% and 70% of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen to bulk soil, whereas in high SOM concentration sites free particulate organic matter contributed up to 70% of the SOC and nitrogen to bulk soil. Aggregate hierarchy in Haplic Andosols was confirmed by different stabilizing mechanisms of micro- and macroaggregates, however, somewhat diminished by oxides (pyrophosphate-, oxalate-, and dithionite-extractable Fe, Al, and Mn) acting as binding agents for macroaggregates. In Histic Andosols, no aggregate hierarchy was observed. The higher macroaggregate stability in organic farming practice compared with conventional farming is of interest due to the importance of macroaggregates in protecting SOM and soils from erosion, which is a prerequisite for soil functions in grasslands that are envisaged for food production in the future.",

The experiment was carried out in 2007–2009, and its aim was the determination of the effect of different nitrogen fertilizers (ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, and Entec-26) on yielding and nutritional value of seven spinach cultivars (Greta F1, Industra, Markiza F1, Matador, Olbrzym Zimowy, Rembrandt F1, and Spokane F1), cultivated in foil tunnel for autumn harvest. The obtained data indicated that the highest marketable yield was provided by application of Entec-26 fertilizer. Similar yielding was also recorded for plants fertilized with ammonium or calcium nitrate, whereas significantly lower one resulted from fertilization with ammonium sulfate. Olbrzym Zimowy appeared to be the best – yielding cultivar, although Spokane F1 and Rembrandt F1 gave the results at comparative level. The application of ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate contributed the least to the accumulation of nitrates in spinach leaves, whereas comparison of cultivars revealed the lowest nitrates accumulation in Matador. Furthermore, this cultivar also contained the highest amount of vitamin C, which was particularly apparent when Entec-26 fertilization was applied. The use of Entec-26 was associated with the highest accumulation of potassium and the lowest content of magnesium. The highest levels of potassium were found in Industra, magnesium – in Olbrzym Zimowy, and Greta F1 featured the highest content of calcium. Ammonium sulfate, assuring the best quality of the crop expressed by a high content of vitamin C and lower nitrates accumulation than other sources of nitrogen, can be recommended for the use in practice.",

There is however limited information on how these SUW affect soil quality and cereal production and quality. In order to answer this question we identified around Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) sites cultivated with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) that had received SUW for less than 5 years, for more than 5 years and less than 10 years and for more than 10 years. We sampled soils at 0–15 and 15–30 cm depth and we analysed pH, total carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and inorganic phosphate (P) content and P and heavy metals availability. We also measured at some of these sites sorghum production and nutrient and metal contents in sorghum grain and straw. Our results show that the 0–15 cm horizon of the soils that had received SUW for less than 5 years had lower pH, available P and heavy metals contents and produced lower yields than those that had been amended with SUW for more than 10 years. Maximum grain yield was observed in the sites that had been amended for more than 5 years but less than 10 years. There were no clear effects of SUW application time on the heavy metal contents of sorghum grain and straw. The increases in nutrient and heavy metals content observed in the 15–30 cm horizon of soils that had been amended for more than 10 years point out to the risks of element transfer to deeper horizons. Our results suggest that a complete sorting of organic matter from SUW and its further composting as presently recommended, is not necessary. Simply removing dangerous items from the SUW such as plastics, glass and batteries, would be sufficient. Adding this sorted substrate for 5 to 10 years to cereal fields would be sufficient to reach optimal yields, thereafter this substrate should be added to other surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Investigations of diurnal and seasonal variations in soil respiration support modeling of regional CO2 budgets and therefore in estimating their potential contribution to greenhouse gases. This study quantifies temporal changes in soil respiration and their driving factors in grassland and arable soils located in Northern Germany. Field measurements at an arable site showed diurnal mean soil respiration rates between 67 and 99 mg CO2 m–2 h–1 with a hysteresis effect following changes in mean soil temperatures. Field soil respiration peaked in April at 5767 mg CO2 m–2 day–1, while values below 300 mg CO2 m–2 day–1 were measured in wintertime. Laboratory incubations were carried out in dark open flow chambers at temperatures from 5°C to 40°C, with 5°C intervals, and soil moisture was controlled at 30%, 50%, and 70% of full water holding capacity. Respiration rates were higher in grassland soils than in arable soils when the incubating temperature exceeded 15°C. The respiration rate difference between them rose with increasing temperature. Monthly median values of incubated soil respiration rates ranged from 0 to 26.12 and 0 to 7.84 µg CO2 g–1 dry weight h–1, respectively, in grassland and arable land. A shortage of available substrate leads to a temporal decline in soil respiration rates, as indicated by a decrease in dissolved organic carbon. Temporal Q10 values decreased from about 4.0 to below 1.5 as temperatures increased in the field. Moreover, the results of our laboratory experiments confirmed that soil temperature is the main controlling factor for the Q10 values. Within the temperature interval between 20°C and 30°C, Q10 values were around 2 while the Q10 values of arable soils were slightly lower compared to that of grassland soils. Thus, laboratory studies may underestimate temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, awareness for transforming laboratory data to field conditions must therefore be taken into account.",

L–1) for the control of the winter-active pathogens Micordochium nivale and Typhula incarnata. Five experiments were conducted on greens and fairways at four sites in Norway and Sweden during the winter seasons of 2011–2012 and 2012–2013. Iprodione (Chipco Green, 250 g a.i. L–1), which was used in Scandinavia until 2009 and is still a widely used fungicide internationally, was included in two experiments. One application of propiconazole (468 g a.i. ha–1) or azoxystrobin + propiconazole (187.5 + 312 g a.i. ha–1) in October controlled 80% of the microdochium patch, and the control of both microdochium patch and typhula blight usually exceeded 90% if the first application of one of these fungicides was followed by at least one application of fludioxonil (375 g a.i. ha–1) before snow cover. After an initial application of propiconazole or azoxystrobin + propiconazole in October, two applications of fludioxonil in late autumn were more efficient in improving visual turf quality in spring than one application of fludioxonil in autumn plus one application of propiconazole just after snow melt in spring. Fludioxonil gave the same level of control of microdochium patch as iprodione despite a much lower use of the active fungicide ingredient. In conclusion, one application of propiconazole or azoxystrobin + propiconazole while the turf is still growing, followed by one applications of fludioxonil after growth cessation, will usually provide adequate control of the winter diseases in turfgrass.",

    "abstract": "The native vegetation in the Tropics is increasingly replaced by crops, pastures, tree plantations, or settlements with contradictory effects on soil organic carbon (SOC). Therefore, the general objective was to estimate the SOC stock depth distribution to 100-cm depth in soils of Costa Rica and to assess their theoretical carbon (C) sink capacity by different management practices. A study was established in three ecoregions of Costa Rica: the Isthmian-Atlantic Moist Forest (AM), the Pacific Dry Forest (PD), and the Montane Forest (MO) ecoregions. Within each ecoregion, three agricultural land uses and a mature forest were sampled to 100-cm depth. The SOC stock in 0–100 cm depth was 114–150 Mg C ha−1 for AM, 76–165 Mg C ha−1 for PD, and 166–246 Mg C ha−1 for MO. Land use had only weak effects on SOC concentrations and stocks except at PD where both were lower for soils under mango (Mangifera indica) and pasture. This may indicate soil degradation which was also supported by data on SOC stratification. However, it was generally unclear whether differences among land uses within each ecoregion already existed particularly at deeper depths before land-use change, and whether the sampling approach was sufficient to investigate them. Nevertheless, about 26–71% of Costa Rica's total C emissions may be offset by SOC sequestration in agricultural and forest soils. However, ecoregion-specific practices must be implemented to realize this potential.",

This task is even more complicated in small ungauged catchments where inadequate amount of input, calibration, and validation data exists and thereby limit the application of process-based, parameter-heavy models. In this study, we present methodology to assess spatial variations in erosion and P losses, and based on source-apportionment and erosion modeling, to develop a base for source- and site-specific abatement countermeasures. Water quality monitoring program was developed to cover spatial variability in erosion and phosphorus (P) losses. Conducted soil survey detected high variations in soil P content within the catchment and strong correlation between soil P test and easily soluble P. A simple water balance model, calibrated for the comparable catchment with existing water flow measurements, was applied to determine water discharge, providing necessary input data for calculations of loads and source-apportionment. Source-apportionment modeling based on results from water discharge modeling, water quality monitoring program and soil survey identified P losses from arable fields as main source of P to two small lakes situated in the catchment, contributing roughly a half of total P load to the lakes. Inclusion of an assumed but previously undocumented point source considerably improved the performance of source-apportionment model. Existence of such a point-source was afterwards confirmed by results from detailed water quality monitoring program. Erosion modeling based on high-resolution digital elevation data identified areas most prone to erosion, and model results were compared to farmers' observations and analyses of 137Cs. Use of a spectrum of models and assessment tools formed a broad support for further steps in abatement efforts, and created concrete discussion base for implementation of detailed site-specific countermeasures.",

Further analysis indicated that the effect of nFe0 on 2,4-D degradation was weaker in soil columns than that in soil slurry. By contrast, 2,4-D degradation is positively influenced by biochar application, which prevented the aggregation and corrosion of Fe nanoparticles. Although the enhanced capacity for 2,4-D adsorption on the soil decelerated dechlorination rate, long-term nFe0 activity was generated. After 72 h, the efficiency of 2,4-D degradation was approximately 53.2% in the soil columns with biochar support.",

In the last years, there has been a stagnated yield and increases in disease incidence and severity worldwide that could be attributed in some extent to soil acidity. This study was conducted to determine the effects of soil acidity alleviation on oil palm seedlings. The effects of ground magnesium limestone or dolomite and magnesium carbonate (0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3 and 4.4 t ha−1) applied to an Ultisol dominated by kaolinite (pH in water 4.4) were evaluated on selected morphological, physiological and nutritional characteristics of hybrid (Deli dura × AVROS pisifera) and clonal (clone 366) oil palm progenies under nursery conditions for 8 months. Increasing rates of ground magnesium limestone and magnesium carbonate showed a significant effect on improving soil pH and lowering exchangeable aluminium. The hybrid oil palm showed significant either linear or quadratic trends for most of the parameters evaluated, indicating that the best responses for morphological and physiological traits were achieved from 2.5 to 4.23 t ha−1 with ground magnesium limestone and 2.87 to 3.45 t ha−1 with magnesium carbonate. Positive effects of increasing rates of ground magnesium limestone and magnesium carbonate were observed on nitrogen and magnesium uptake. Aluminium concentration in the third frond decreased significantly with increasing ground magnesium limestone rate. A significant reduction of manganese uptake was also observed with increasing rates of both ameliorants. The clonal oil palm progeny exhibited a better performance on un-amended treatment. This may be explained by the significant higher root growth of this progeny. Soil acidity alleviation improved the oil palm seedling growth. These results are important for the oil palm industry and could be applied in the nursery stage as well as extended to the immature stage.",

As alternatives, different Brassica crops (year 1: rapeseed, oilseed radish and white mustard; year 2: rapeseed, oilseed radish, oilseed rape, kale and white mustard) were tested (fresh foliage was incorporated into the soil by ploughing) for their biofumigant effect. Results of our investigation showed that in both years the potato yield was affected by measures of pest control; however, none of the tested biofumigant plants proved to be a potentially promising candidate in wireworm control. The rapid release of volatiles after plant chopping before and during incorporation into the soil could be the reason of inefficacy in our experiment. In our study, most wireworm damage occurred on biggest potato tubers. Moreover, edge effect of the field played an important role in our experiment in year 1. Treatment (chemical or biological) of wireworms only at the edge part of the field could offer a cost-effective, time-saving and environmentally more friendly way of controlling studied pest organism.",

The objective of this study is to illustrate the differences in soil organic nitrogen mineralisation caused by irrigation volume and frequency, and provide theoretical bases for the process of nitrogen transformation and nitrogen fertiliser application under different irrigation methods. The soil nitrogen mineralisation process was studied by the long-term intermittent leaching aerobic incubation method which was used by Standford and Smith in 1972. Parameters of soil nitrogen mineralisation potential (N0), the mineralisation rate constant (k) and half-life period (t1/2) in different soil layers were studied in greenhouse tomato cultivation for seven years, irrigated in three ways: subsurface irrigation (SI), drip irrigation (DI) and furrow irrigation (FI). The results showed that the first-order reaction kinetic model can be used to predict the soil organic nitrogen mineralisation characteristics in a greenhouse. There were five soil layers (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40 and 40–50 cm) in this study. In 0–20 cm soil layers, the N0 value of DI was highest, then FI, and SI was lowest. Apart from 10 to 20 cm soil layer, the k values of SI and DI were higher than for FI in other soil layers, while the t1/2 value of FI was highest, then DI, and t1/2 of SI was the lowest. The main reasons were that large amounts of water in FI would lead to increased soil bulk density and reduced soil temperature. DI with property ratio of the temperature and moisture was beneficial to organic nitrogen mineralisation. For SI, due to the overall upward movement of water for many years, nitrate accumulated and the pH value decreased in 0–20 cm soil layers. DI could increase the proportion of N0 value to the soil's total nitrogen. Therefore, according to the results of this study, DI gives the best effect on soil fertility, followed by SI and then by FI.",

    "abstract": "Changes in colour, phenolic composition and ascorbic acid (AA) concentrations in jams made from eight, floricane fruiting, red raspberry genotypes stored for six months at 20°C were investigated. Additionally, the relationship between genotypes and quality parameters was assessed. On average for all genotypes, 83% AA degradation was observed during the first three months of storage. After six months, the concentrations of anthocyanins, total quercetin glycosides and lambertianin C decreased by 80%, 13% and 7%, while ellagic acid conjugates and total phenolics increased by 47% and 8%, respectively. The anthocyanins detected in highest concentrations in fresh jams, that is, cyanidin-3-(2g-glucosylrutinoside), cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside showed the highest stability during storage, that is, 28%, 21%, 12% and 11% left after six months of storage, respectively. A significant decrease in colour (lightness, chroma and hue) was also observed during storage. The colour changes of stored jams, however, were much slower than the pigment degradation. On average, lightness, chroma and hue decreased by 13%, 29% and 18% during six months of storage, respectively. The lowest anthocyanin degradation was observed in jams characterised by red-bluish colour and high initial anthocyanin content, that is, ‘Veten’, ‘RU024 01003’ and ‘RU974 07002’ with 72–78% degradation after storage for six months, while the highest losses (82–93%) were observed in jams characterised by saturated red-orange colour, high ellagitanin and low initial anthocyanin contents, that is, ‘Glen Magna’, ‘Malling Hestia’ and ‘Octavia’. The results indicate that the genotypes ‘RU024 01003’ and ‘RU974 07002’ might have the potential to replace ‘Veten’, the main cultivar for jam processing in Norway, as new cultivars for industrial processing provided good cultivation qualities and satisfactory taste and flavour of the products.",

Rhizosphere soil is the main processes place at the soil–root interface. This study investigated the kinetics of F release from rhizosphere soil of tea plant extracted by malic and citric acids and the effect of F supply on malic and citric acids metabolism. The results showed that both the F release kinetics from rhizosphere in malic and citric acid extractant solutions were well fitted to Elovich equations. F supply induced a decrease in secretion of malic and citric acids and their accumulations in root and leaf. The amount of malic acid release in culture medium was linear with the root malic acid concentration. Both the malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activities were decreased under F treatments. This is the first study surveying the F release from rhizosphere of tea plant involved in OAs extractions.",

Similarly plant height, tiller fertility rate, grain yield, relative water content in the leaves as well as quality of forage also increased for superabsorbent polymer treatment. Considering the trends of growth reduction (qualitative and quantitative) due to fertilizer reduction and progressive influence of superabsorbent polymer on those parameters, it was clear that application of superabsorbent polymer plus only half the conventional fertilizer rate (150 kg ha−1) would be a more appropriate practice for forage oat production under arid and semiarid conditions of northern China or in areas with similar ecologies.",

    "abstract": "In grassland areas where herbage production has no economic value, the cut grass is often left on the sward surface where its decomposition is influenced by weather conditions. Although the influence of temperature and humidity on decomposition has been investigated under controlled lab conditions, experimentation has generally been under ideal moisture conditions that have not tested the combinations of climatic limitations that might occur in the field. The decomposition of mown turfgrass clippings deposited at different times of vegetation period was studied in situ using nylon bags during the first 8 weeks after deposition to investigate the effect of weather conditions (the air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation) on decomposition. Decomposition is the highest in the case of high air humidity and temperature of 10°C. Limiting factors for decomposition at temperatures above 10°C is the air humidity and below 10°C the air temperature. The general tendency was that the rate of decomposition increased with increasing air temperature up to 10°C, but with further increases of air temperature the decomposition rate slowed down. Relative air humidity had a variable impact (at the beginning of the decomposition process (weeks 1–2) the influence was negative, during weeks 3–8 of the decomposition process the effect was positive), and hence had no generalized relationship with decomposition over the studied decomposition period (weeks 1–8). The most significant influence of weather conditions on the decomposition rate was recorded directly after cutting. If the cutting was done during hot weather conditions, the material was drying fast and therefore decomposed slowly. Our results indicate that for fast decomposition of clippings it is important to maintain the freshness of material. Lower decomposition rates occurred during conditions of hot and dry weather, and also cooler (temperature near to 0°C) weather, and can be compensated as soon as favourable weather arrives.",

Physiological process (transpiration, stomatal conductance, CO2 internal concentration, net photosynthesis, and relative chlorophyll index), B level in leaves and grain yield were measured. These data were used to determine the economic viability of B fertilization in common beans. Both boric acid and borax increased B levels in common beans leaves. Borax affected some physiological process reducing stomatal conductance and increasing net photosynthesis. Using borax, the highest net photosynthesis was observed at a rate of 4 kg ha−1, while the boric acid increased net photosynthesis linearly after increasing B doses application. An enhance of 311 kg ha−1 in the grain yield was observed using borax related to the control (without B application); however, grain yield decreased linearly after application of increasing B doses, as boric acid.

    "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to study the inhibitor factors present in suppressive soil that suppressed the soybean cyst nematode (SCN) in the black soil fields with 21 years continuous cropping of soybean (SSSS) and 3 years continuous cropping of soybean followed by 1 year corn (SSSC). Compared with the SSSC field, the densities of SCN significantly (P < 0.05) declined in SSSS field. In a soil microcosm with suppressive soil, the population of SCN decreased after the addition of pimaricin (fungal inhibitor) and streptomycin (bacterial inhibitor), but the population of SCN declined more significantly by adding streptomycin to the suppressive soil than adding pimaricin. Fusarium equiseti, Pochonia chlamydosporia and Purpureocillium lilacinum were isolated from cysts, eggs and J2 of SCN and soil in SSSS and SSC field. The population density of these parasitic fungi was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in SSSS field than in SSSC field. The density of P. chlamydosporia was higher than other fungi. Real-time PCR was used to test genomic DNA of P. chlamydosporia in SSSS and SSC field soil. The mass of genomic DNA and the population density of P. chlamydosporia were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in SSSS field than in SSSC field. This study has revealed that fungi, especially P. chlamydosporia, may play an important role in the suppression of SCN population in the suppressive soil.",

    "abstract": "Water stress is one of the major environmental stresses that affect agricultural production worldwide, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This research investigated the effect of water deficit, induced by PEG-6000 on wheat genotypes (GA-2002, Chakwal-97, Uqab-2000, Chakwal-50 and Wafaq-2001) grown in modified MS medium solution. Osmotic stress caused a more pronounced inhibition in leaf relative water content and leaf membrane stability more sensitive (index in Wafaq-2001 and Uqab-2000) genotypes compared with the tolerant (Chakwal-50, GA-2002 and Chakwal-97) genotypes. Upon dehydration, an incline in proline, total soluble sugar, total soluble protein, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase and malondialdehyde activity content were evident in all genotypes, especially at osmotic stress of −8 bars. The observed data showed that status of biochemical attributes and antioxidant enzymes could provide a meaningful tool for depicting drought tolerance of wheat genotypes. The present study shows that genotypic differences in drought tolerance could be likely attributed to the ability of wheat plants to induce antioxidant defense under drought conditions. In order to develop genotypes with stable, higher yields in dry farming conditions, it is necessary to characterise genetic resources based on drought adaptation, determine suitable genotypes, and then use them in breeding programmes.",

Research was carried out in a spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) crop without catch crops, with undersown red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and with post-crop white mustard (Sinapis alba L.). The barley was unfertilised, fertilised at moderate rates or at high rates. Straw was managed by either removing it from the field or chopping and spreading it. The quantity of organic matter and N incorporated into the soil depended on the fertilisation level of the barley crop. Soil mineral N stocks in the spring were reduced when straw was used together with red clover. When white mustard mass was incorporated alone in the autumn during ploughing, soil mineral N was reduced in the spring; however, when it was incorporated with straw, the effect was the opposite. Soil mineral N content is controllable when organic matter components are combined according to their decomposition rates, masses, and incorporation times.",

The repellency study was carried out in a large-scale field trial in SE Norway in 2013. On average for observations during the first week after spraying, 17 and 40% less honey bees (P = .03) and 26 and 20% less bumble bees (P = .36) were observed on plots sprayed with the pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin and alpha-cypermethrin, respectively, than on unsprayed control plots. No pollinator repellency was found on plots sprayed with the neonicotinoid thiacloprid. Compared with unsprayed control the seed yield increases were 22% on plots sprayed with thiacloprid vs. 12–13% on plots sprayed with pyrethroids (P = .10). Follow-up studies in 2014–2016 focused on the effect of thiacloprid on bumble bee colony development in commercially reared nests of Bombus terrestris placed into red clover seed crops at the start of flowering. Unsprayed control crops were compared with crops sprayed either at the bud stage or when 18–44% of flower heads were in full bloom. Chemical analyses of adult bumble bees showed that thiacloprid was taken up in bees when crops were sprayed during flowering, but not detected when crops were sprayed at the bud stage. The bumble bees in late-sprayed crops also developed weaker colonies than in unsprayed crops. Dead bees with a high internal concentration of thiacloprid were found in one crop sprayed during the night at 35% flowering. This shows that thiacloprid is not bee-safe if sprayed after anthesis and that spraying has to be conducted at the bud stage to reduce its contamination of nectar and pollen.",

The bacterial community was analysed through high-throughput sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Fifteen soils, including barren land, cropland and greenhouse soils which were sandy loam Fluvisols, were selected from different fields in Beijing, China, with AP contents ranging from 5.03 to 391.45 mg kg−1. Statistical analyses revealed high AP (>100 mg kg−1) decreased alpha diversity (Shannon's index, H') but not beta diversity of the soil bacterial community. The sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria were the dominant phyla in sandy loam Fluvisols. AP, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) had synergistic influence on the shift of the bacterial community composition. Moreover, AP was the main driving factor affecting the soil bacterial community composition compared with other environmental factors. The members of the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria belonging to copiotrophic taxa typically increased in relative abundance in high-P soils, while oligotrophic taxa (mainly Acidobacteria) decreased in relative abundance. Our results demonstrated that the bacterial community composition would shift from oligotrophic to copiotrophic with increasing levels of AP.",

Using two models describing the relationship between latency period and temperature, we performed simulations aimed at predicting changes in the latency period of leaf rust (Puccina recondita f. sp. tritici) on triticale in response to expected climate change. The simulations were based on meteorological data recorded in the period 1986–2005 at locations representing 16 provinces in Poland and based on values obtained after transformation of the observed data to reflect temperature changes under four scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) according to the giss_e2_r climate model. In all scenarios, the results for the two triticale cultivars studied, Witon (vulnerable to P. recondita) and Gniewko (less susceptible), showed a threat of faster development (shorter leaf rust latency period) on triticale triggered by climate change in south-east and south-central Poland than in other regions. The results also showed an increased probability of future regional diversification of leaf rust latency period duration on vulnerable triticale cultivars, opportunities for earlier start of leaf rust epidemics on triticale in Poland and an increase in final disease severity in comparison with 1986–2005.",

We conducted a six-year experiment on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China. Six treatments were established: deep tillage (DT), shallow tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT), deep tillage with organic fertiliser (DTF), shallow tillage with organic fertiliser (STF), and no-tillage with organic fertiliser (NTF). Results indicated that during the winter wheat growing season, the highest contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and easily-oxidised organic carbon (EOC) were in the STF treatment. During the summer maizegrowing season, the DTF treatment had the highest SOC and EOC contents. Compared with the other treatments, the NTF treatment had higher Chao1 and Shannon indices for bacteria; however, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria is highest in all treatments. A redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that bacterial community composition was correlated with variation of the SOC, DOC, EOC, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Our results showed that combining the two components of the SOC fractions and bacterial community composition, STF practice in a maize–wheat rotation was a sustainable approach to optimising soil structure and improving soil quality.",

The present investigation had the objective of determining the effect of NO3−-N and K in Romaine lettuce cultivated in floating hydroponic system and the impact of nutrient solution aeration. Materials and methods: Plants were transplanted into 34 L rigid plastic containers with aerated or non-aerated solutions containing either 15/7, 12/8.5 or 12/2.85 meq L−1 of NO3−/K concentration. Results: Aeration of the nutrient solution promoted plant growth, leaf K, P, and Mg, and water uptake, however, photosynthesis and transpiration rates were enhanced under non-aeration conditions. Decreasing N did not affect leaf N uptake and accumulation; however, decreasing K markedly decreased leaf P and K in aerated plants. Despite the higher transpiration and stomatic conductance in non-aerated plants, water uptake was higher in aerated plants. Non-aerated plants exhibited decreased leaf K accumulation. Conclusions: non-aeration or reduction of K concentration of the nutrient solution may be a strategy to reduce leaf K in lettuce; leaf N concentration was unaffected by aeration.",

Three field trials were conducted for six growing seasons in central and southern Sweden. In two of the trials, we compared CTF with random traffic farming (RTF) in deep chiseling (DC, 15–20 cm), shallow cultivation (SC, 5–10 cm) and no-till. The third trial was on farm study by using the existing CTF module at the farm. In the tracks of CTF (traffic zone) dry bulk density was increased and water movement was decreased. Soil penetration resistance was greater in the traffic zone than in the crop zone in some of the trials but the difference was not statistically significant. On average, crop yield was similar between CTF and RTF for all trials. Yield in the traffic zone was significantly less than that in the crop zone in the on-farm trial, but the yield in both zones were similar in the field trial at Lönnstorp, south Sweden. On the contrary, in the field trial at Säby 1 in Uppsala, central Sweden, crop zone produced less yield than traffic zone probably because of too loose soil, which impaired the uptake of nutrients and water. We conclude that if vehicle weight is not very high and the soil is not vulnerable to compaction, dual wheels and CTF are equal options.",

Data were collected from 70 cowpea genotypes planted in two different locations during the 2017/18 and 2018/19 cropping seasons in South Africa. Grain samples were analysed for selected minerals such as Fe, Zn, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, and phytochemical contents including total phenolic and flavonoid. Genotype, locations, seasons, and their interaction effects were highly significant (p < 0.001) for all traits. Best linear unbiased predictors identified superior genotypes for all traits in both locations. There were significant (p < 0.05) correlations among most of the traits evaluated. The high negative association of total phenolics with most of the minerals indicated that selecting for total phenolics may unintentionally reduce the content of minerals.

The treatments comprised four radial distances of 1.5m, 3.5m, 5.5m, and 12.5m as a control away from the tree with three replications. Results showed that higher wheat yields were recorded at 5.5m and 3.5m than at 12.5m, with yield increments of 11 and 12%, respectively compared to 12.5m. The highest maize yield was obtained from 3.5m, with a yield advantage of 12.3% compared to 12.5m. Teff yield increased with increasing distance from the tree trunk. Wheat and maize yield gains near the canopies may be associated with higher organic matter and soil nutrients, while their yield reduction with decreasing distance from the tree may be associated with the shading effect of tree canopies. Wheat was the most compatible crop when integrated with A. albida under shade conditions followed by maize, while teff was highly susceptible to shading effect. We suggest that integrating A. albida with the right crops and appropriate tree management could enhance crop yield. Lopping is required before sowing teff and maize with A. albida to minimize shading effects",

This paper studied the morphological and physiological response of rhizomes of Leymus chinensis, which grows rapidly and is highly tolerant to arid and saline–alkaline soils, to different levels of saline–alkali stress. Biomass and density of rhizomes showed a variation along with the increase in saline–alkali stress; they show the maximum level in a saline–alkali medium. Rhizome internode length and specific root length gradually increased, while root biomass indicated a contrary tendency towards increase in saline–alkali stress. Under different saline–alkali stress, the root–shoot ratio showed no significant differences among groups. The variation in Na+ content was increased with the increase in saline–alkali stress. The contents of K+ and proline were the highest in a saline–alkali medium; under different levels of salt–alkali stress, the presence of organic acids (OAs) showed different changes. Citrate, malate and succinate were the dominant OAs accumulated in rhizomes. The activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase increased with incrementing salt–alkaline stress. In summary, L. chinensis is likely to exert a series of adaptable response on its physiology and morphology under different levels of salt-alkaline stress. Further study on large-scale cultivation of the L. chinensis would be beneficial for the ecological recovery and exploitation of the salt-alkalinized soil.",

    "abstract": "The stimulation of seed germination by smoke and aqueous smoke extracts from the combustion of plant material has recently received a great deal of attention. This study was conducted to assess the effects of smoke on the weed species Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyard grass). Plant-derived smoke was produced from Bauhinia variegata using a newly designed furnace and then applied to the weed species. The results showed that plant-derived smoke solution significantly increased the germination rate (70–92.3%), germination percentage (31–47%), fresh weight (30–69%), shoot and root length (10–14.9%, 35–44%), germination index (50–100%) and vigour index (114–157%) of barnyard grass relative to the control. Treatment with plant-derived smoke solution also significantly reduced the endogenous abscisic acid of seeds, while α-amylase activity increased significantly compared to the control. Overall, these findings indicate that stimulation and quick emergence from a dormant soil seed bank of barnyard grass can be induced by plant-derived smoke solution followed by chemical control through known weedicide/herbicide treatments as an eco-friendly alternative method of weed control.",

    "abstract": "The responses of runoff and erosion to soil surface roughness (SSR) have been extensively studied in the past decades; however, most of these studies were conducted at the early stage of rainfall, whereas few studies were specifically conducted during steady runoff conditions. In this study, runoff, soil losses and sediment particle sizes from smooth and rough surfaces were measured after surface runoff stabilisation to improve the understanding of the relationship between SSR and soil erosion. A cascade of two independent soil boxes in which the runoff samples from upslope and downslope boxes can be collected independently or together was used to perform the experiments. The upslope box supplied runoff to the downslope study box. Three rainfall intensities of 50, 75 and 100 mm/h were applied. The results suggest that SSR has a significant effect on soil erosion when runoff reaches a steady state. Although the difference in the runoff rate was small between the rough and smooth surfaces, the sediment rate and concentration of particles were significantly lower for the rough surface than for the smooth surface. Through analysing the particle size distribution (PSD) of sediment, we found that selective sediment delivery is an important reason for the soil erosion reduction by SSR. The rainfall intensity decreased the difference in the sediment rates between the smooth and rough surfaces. The extra inflow increased the runoff rates, sediment rates and concentration rates for both the smooth and rough surfaces; however, the increasing degrees of the runoff rate, sediment rate and concentration rate had significant differences between the rough and smooth surfaces. A stepwise multiple regression showed that significant linear relationships existed between one or more PSDs of 20–50, 50–100, 100–250 and 1000–2000 µm and the sediment rate.",

The objective of this paper was to investigate the effect of P application and P balance on stream P concentrations in different production systems of Norwegian agriculture. The average application of P in the studied catchments ranged from 21 to 53 kg P ha−1 yr−1, including the P application in both mineral fertiliser and manure for the monitoring periods (16–20 years). The highest P application was found in a catchment with high livestock density, and potato and vegetable production. This catchment also showed the highest P balance (applied P minus P removed with yields) of 26 kg P ha−1 yr−1 on average, and also a very high soil P status (P-AL). The P balance for all other catchments ranged from 3 to 13 kg P ha−1 yr−1. For all catchments, the average application of mineral P fertiliser decreased during the monitoring period, especially during the last 2–3 years. However, total P application increased in three catchments due to increased livestock density and manure P application. Average concentrations of total P in the streams varied from 65 to 392 µg L−1. The highest concentration was measured in the stream from the catchment with highest P balance and soil P status. The concentrations of dissolved reactive P varied from 27 to 63 µg L−1 with the highest concentration measured from an area with intensive livestock production. Reducing P application and soil P status to the minimum level for crop growth is important for the environmental quality of surface waters.",

A total of 103 soil samples from the top 20 cm of soil layer were collected and analyzed for macro- and micronutrient elements. The mean values of these elements were: total nitrogen (TN), 0.08 ± 0.02%; available nitrogen (AN), 60.34 ± 10.08 mg/kg; available phosphorus (AP), 19.59 ± 9.75 mg/kg; available potassium (AK), 84.22 ± 19.66 mg/kg; and availabilities of trace elements (B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, and Zn), 0.29 ± 0.12, 1.44 ± 0.34, 8.97 ± 2.05, 5.44 ± 0.95, 0.27 ± 0.16, 1.16 ± 0.42 mg/kg, respectively. Compared with other similar areas, the overall soil nutrient content in the study area was still at a low level after nearly 30 years of wastewater irrigation. The organic matter content of wastewater-irrigated soils has significant impact on the accumulation of nutrient elements in these soils. Geostatistical analyses suggested that the spatial distribution of TN and AP was on account of agricultural practices, such as wastewater irrigation and fertilizer use. The availability of P, Mo, Cu and Zn may be due to the joint effect of soil parent material and wastewater irrigation. The availability of K, Fe and Mn was attributed to soil parent material. A significant availability of some elements occurred around sewage outfalls in the irrigation area and water canals, where the wastewater could be easily lifted. The knowledge of spatial distribution and sources of soil nutrients in such areas is the basis for undertaking appropriate farming and irrigation activities with rationalized utilization of treated wastewater.",

    "abstract": "A new generic, three-dimensional, solute transport component was developed into FLUSH, which is a hydrological model developed for Nordic conditions. Water flow and solute transport descriptions in FLUSH follow the dual-permeability concept, which divides the total soil pore space into mobile soil matrix and macropore systems. The solute transport model was parameterized to simulate the main processes of nitrogen (N) cycle in clayey, subsurface-drained soils during autumn periods after the harvest. The model simulates transport of nitrate and ammonium N, as well as mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification. Reactions in soil are affected by temperature and moisture, as simulated by FLUSH. Ammonium can adsorb on soil particles in both pore systems, while organic N is described in simulations as an immobile solute in the soil matrix. One-dimensional version of the model was applied to two subdrained field sections (1.3 and 3.4 ha) in the Nummela experimental field in southern Finland during two autumn periods (2008 and 2011). The model was able to replicate the measured dynamics of nitrate N concentrations in drain discharge during both the periods. Concentrations were the most dependent on drain discharge dynamics and the rate of nitrification. Measured and simulated ammonium concentrations in drain discharge were about 10 times smaller than nitrate concentrations, even though the levels of N input with initial values and deposition for both inorganic fractions were similar. Successful solute transport simulation results further increase the confidence in the description of the water flow processes in FLUSH.",

The effects of 0, 1, 3, 6, and 10 FTCs on soil P adsorption and desorption were determined. Each cycle consisted of freezing for 12 h at −10 °C and thawing for 12 h at +7 °C, mimicking a diurnal pattern, at initial soil-moisture contents of 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% and at amounts of added P of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg P L−1. Pads increased significantly with increasing amounts of added P. The freeze–thaws of black soils significantly decreased Pads and buffering capacities, which would promote the release of adsorbed P and increase the risk of reducing soil P. High moisture content also affected the behavior of soil P adsorption by reducing adsorbed P as the number of FTCs increased. The P-isotherm data for all soils at equilibrium-P concentrations fit the Langmuir equation well (R2 = 0.93 or higher).

To determine background N concentrations, a total of 39 smaller Danish streams draining relatively undisturbed catchments in different regions were selected and screened for N concentrations and discharge during a 1-year period (2004–2005). Only 19 of the streams fulfilled the threshold set for least disturbed conditions (LDC) in their catchments (proportion of agricultural land <10%). Within the five sampled dominant landscape types in Denmark, the concentrations of ammonium N and total organic N in the LDC streams were found to be nearly constant: 0.05 ± 0.01 mg N L−1 and 0.53 ± 0.07 mg N L−1, respectively. In contrast, the concentration of nitrate N differed significantly (P < 0.05) between the five landscape types, with variations between 0.06 and 0.83 mg N L−1. An analysis of all the 39 streams sampled demonstrated significantly different relationships between the proportion of land use and the flow-weighted annual concentration of nitrate N for two dominant soil types with a Y-axis intercept equal to 0.12 mg N L−1 for streams draining coarse textural soils and 0.76 mg N L−1 for streams draining finer textural soils. A significant (P < 0.05) downward trend (18–41%) emerged for flow-weighted annual total N concentrations in four of the five streams that were sampled during the period 1990–2011. A 5 × 5 km grid map of Denmark showing nitrate N and total N background concentrations was produced and used for estimating background N losses to Danish surface waters. Based on the grid map, the average annual background loss of total N was calculated to be 13,000 tonnes N or 19% of the total N loading to Danish coastal waters during the period 2004–2005.",

The tillage practices included moldboard plow tillage (MOT), rotary tillage (ROT), reduced tillage (RET), combined tillage (COT), and no tillage (NOT). The surface soil water content at depths of 0–20 cm was higher under NOT compared with other tillage practices, but not different at the deeper soil depths in 2011. The soil temperatures under NOT and RET were lower than those under moldboard plow tillage and ROT at depths of 5 and 15 cm, respectively, measured at 9:00 am in 2005. From the hourly dynamics of soil temperature, the differences among the tillage practices mainly appeared during the daytime (from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm). Among all the practices, the average daily soil temperature under ROT was the highest, while that under NOT was the lowest. MOT, ROT, and RET had higher soil accumulative infiltration compared with NOT and COT. The surface soil bulk density under NOT was higher than or equal to that under the other four tillage practices. The maize yields under NOT were the lowest among all the tillage practices for three years straight. Meanwhile, the yields under MOT were the highest, which were about 47%, 61%, and 38% higher than those under NOT.

Our objectives were to investigate the effects of land use types under different soil management practices on soil fertility, organic carbon pools, and the microbial community at this site. Three land use types were investigated: original land without farming, farmland with residue return, and a vegetable greenhouse with farmyard manure amendment. The carbon stocks were calculated according to the equivalent soil mass method, and microbial community structure was determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Over 30 years, the current concentrations of alkali-hydrolysis nitrogen, available potassium (AK), and available phosphorus increased in the three land use types, except for the AK concentration in farmland, which decreased due to the lack of potassium fertilizer input. The nutrients in the greenhouse were significantly higher than those in the original land and farmland. The carbon stocks in the original land, farmland, and greenhouse were increased by 103%, 179%, and 660%, respectively. Both land use types and seasons influenced particulate organic carbon, chemical-labile organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon. The microbial community structures were distinctly different between the three land use types. Overall, the soil available nutrients and carbon stocks increased compared to their 1980 levels in the three land use types, and labile carbon pools and microbial community structure exhibited different responses in the three land use types. Compared to spontaneous development, mineral fertilization and organic amendment are more effective for recovering soil fertility in reclaimed soils.",

A study conducted in two summer crop seasons (November–March 2012/2013 and 2013/2014) examined the impact of three tillage methods (hand hoeing, strip tillage and conventional tillage), two fertiliser levels (0 and 40% N) and two water supply regimes (rainfed and irrigated) on maize root development and grain yield on a sandy soil in a semi-arid region of Mozambique. Tillage had a major effect on soil penetration resistance, but little effect on root growth and limited effect on yield. Thus, there appears to be little need for loosening on this soil. There was also no interaction between tillage and the other experimental factors, meaning that tillage system can be chosen irrespective of fertiliser and water supply. Irrigation had the largest impact on root and shoot growth and crop yield, increasing yield in season 2 from 670 to 4780 kg ha–1.There was a very strong interaction between fertiliser and water supply, with no yield increase for fertiliser in the rainfed treatment, while combined with irrigation it increased yield by 1590 kg ha–1 in season 1 and 1840 kg ha–1 in season 2. Thus, for the conditions studied here, it was rational to add fertiliser only in combination with irrigation and not in a rainfed system.",

Azam under mercuric chloride (HgCl2)-induced stress. Soil was contaminated with different concentrations of HgCl2 (1 and 0.5 mg/kg). The MALE was applied at 5% and 2.5% as seed soaking prior to sowing of seeds in the pots. The M. oleifera leaf was a good source of macronutrients (Na, K, Ca and Mg) and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Mn, Co and Ni) as well as natural phenolics. The induced HgCl2 stress significantly reduced seed germination (%), shoot dry weight, root dry weight, chlorophyll content and carotenoids content. The HgCl2-induced stress was associated with accumulation of phenolics and Hg in roots. The accumulation of Hg in roots was significantly correlated with phenolics content (r = .8007, p = .000). The exogenous application of MALE significantly ameliorated adverse effects of HgCl2 stress on maize plants. The accumulation of Hg in roots was significantly increased by MALE. It is inferred from findings of the present investigation that MALE served as bioregulator and can be applied to reduce adverse effects of HgCl2 on maize. Moreover, MALE can enhance the Hg phytoremediation potential of maize.",

    "abstract": "Before its establishment in Estonia at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say was a notifiable quarantine pest for many years. In high-latitude environments it encounters strong evolutionary pressure to adapt to low temperatures due to high overwintering mortality and periodic influx of new individuals from more southern populations. Our study focused on gathering evidence for such a range shift leading to the formation of a permanent local population. The phenology and overwintering success of beetles was investigated from 2008 to 2015. Depending on weather conditions in the different years, the overwintered beetles emerged from the soil from the beginning of May to mid-June. Over 700 degree days accumulated in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 exceeding the limit needed for development of two generations. However, food supply and temperature distribution in the growing period enabled development of the second complete generation only in 2010 and 2013. Survival of overwintering beetles in field conditions varied between 18% and 47% in the different years. Winter mortality was not associated with low air temperature in any year as snow cover provided the necessary protection and winter soil temperatures at the depth of 30 cm remained at around 0°C for the duration of the whole observation period, with only some records as low as −3.5°C. The survival of overwintering beetles is more likely defined by factors other than low temperature. As a result of periodic invasions of beetles with naturally lower cold resistance originating from southern regions, the structure of the overwintering population in Nordic temperate conditions is not homogeneous. Moreover, this may also be derived from cultural practices, as commercial producers regularly apply agrochemicals while organic growers avoid them.",

Kura clover yields of 7.2–8.3 Mg ha−1 were second to lucerne by the third production year but long-term performance was diminished by stand thinning. Kura clover and white clover had lower fiber concentrations and greater protein concentrations and forage digestibility than red clover and lucerne. Kura clover can be a source of high-quality forage in Europe, but cannot be recommended for use in areas with known Sclerotinia trifoliorum presence until resistance to this pathogen is developed.",

Surveys were done to determine the distribution of viruses in cabbage cultivated areas in 2012–2014. According to the results of field observations, characteristic virus symptoms were observed on some cabbage plants. The average percentages of symptoms-affected plants were recorded as 2–20% in the visited fields. A total of 535 leaf samples were collected from cabbage fields and tested for the presence of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), and Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) by double-antibody sandwich Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) using virus-specific polyclonal antiserum. The ELISA results revealed that 8.1% and 6.9% of these samples were infected with TuMV and CaMV, respectively. The TuMV+CaMV mixed infection ratio was 2.1%. However, CMV, TYMV, and BWYV were not detected. This is the first comprehensive study of viruses on Brassica crops in the Black Sea Region of Turkey, the most important centre for cabbage production in Turkey.",

Unfortunately, there is a lack of continuous soil moisture data in predicting trafficable conditions. To measure changes in soil moisture conditions in real time, Percostation (Adek) sensors were installed in sandy loam Stagnosol soil at different depths. Problems with soil trafficability can be expected at the plastic limit, and the soil is unable to support vehicle operations at the liquid limit in such soils. The maximum water-holding capacity of the soil is 32%, the field capacity is 25%, the plastic limit is 22%, and the liquid limit is 30%. With rainfall of more than 10 mm d−1, the moisture content reached the plastic limit in the upper 25 cm of soil. The average increase in the soil moisture content after more than 10 mm of rain was 1–2.5% in a time frame of 2–3 hours. After rain, the previous soil moisture level was obtained within 2 to 3 days in the vegetation period. Measurements also allowed soil water balance and evapotranspiration modelling data to predict soil moisture conditions with an accuracy of one day but failed to predict in a shorter period.",

The field experiment was performed on sandy loam Luvisol during 2008–2014. The following treatments were carried out: organic (ORG), organic with farmyard cattle manure (ORGFYM) and conventional with farmyard cattle manure and mineral fertilizers (CONFYM). Soil samples were collected yearly in September and analyzed for P, K, Mg and Ca by the Mehlich III method. In parallel, ammonium lactate extractable P and K (AL method), and ammonium acetate extractable Mg and Ca (NH4OAc-method) were determined. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the analysis results achieved by the Mehlich III method and alternative methods were calculated. In all the treatments, no significant changes in soil Corg content were established over seven years. A significant (p < .05) decrease in soil pH was shown for the CONFYM treatment. Organic management without nutrients' input does not decrease the content of PAL in the soil but considerable decrease in the soil KAL content was revealed. The application of cattle manure (60 t ha−1 for the 5-year crop rotation) in both organic and conventional treatments sustained the status of available nutrients in the soil. The Pearson correlation coefficients between Mehlich III and AL methods for P (r = 0.770, p < .01) were lower than for K (r = 0.922, p < .01). The highest correlation between Mehlich III and NH4OAc-methods was found in the case of Mg (r = 0.951, p < .01) whereat for Ca the correlation was somewhat weaker (r = 0.841, p < .01). It was also shown that the PMehlich III/PAL quotient was inversely proportional with the CaMehlich III values.",

    "abstract": "Chickpea is considered among the most sensitive grain legumes to salinity. The improvement of tolerance of lines in combination with tolerant rhizobial strains depends on various environmental and cultural conditions such as soil properties. This investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effect of phosphorus fertilization (0, 90 and 200 kg ha−1 of P2O5) on biomass, nodular traits and grain yield (GY) of chickpea (cv. Flip 84-79C) growing under salinity (0 and 150 mM NaCl). The trial was laid out following a randomized block design with three replicates during 2010–2012, at the experimental farm of Oued Smar (Algiers). Salinity did not significantly decrease the dry biomass of the plants but the relative shoot growth was more affected than control, P and SP1 treatments. Besides, salinity significantly reduced GY (−20%) and nodulation traits compared to the control plants while an inversely proportional relationship was found between protein, leghemoglobin and MDA content, K/Na ratio and the increase in salt concentration. Application of two P levels to saline soil enhanced growing conditions of plants. Particularly, the (90 kg ha–1 of P × 150 mM NaCl) combination significantly increased leghemoglobin (92%), reduced proline content (−69%) and protected membranes against peroxydation compared to saline conditions. A significant increase was observed in the GY (about 30%) of plants at both P doses combined with salt stress compared to other cases. Statistically, the low P level combined with salinity induced similar responses of plants and sometimes better responses to control plants. Finally, our results support the roles of phosphorus fertilizer in the alleviation of salt stress and enhancing the soil quality for better symbiosis efficiency and yield of chickpea.",

    "abstract": "Adequate treatment of organic manures and digestates from livestock production should reduce environmental impacts and provide well-defined and attractive biofertlisers for a crop production market, which can promote the closure of the nutrient cycle in agriculture. In this sense, a survey was conducted during the autumn of 2021 to investigate Swedish farmers' perspectives on organic fertilisers use. The survey consisted of an online questionnaire, which was distributed broadly in the social media, homepages, different types of networks and at course events in order to reach all types of farms. There were 22 questions focused on current use, reasons for current use and preferences for future use. The analysis of the 99 fully responded surveys, demonstrated that 43% of the respondents think that they will increase their use of organic fertilisers in the coming 5–10 years and 60% think that they will use manure digestate in different forms (both solid and liquid fractions). Soil improvement was the main reason to use organic fertilisers, but there were also preferences for organic fertilisers with fast release of nutrients. The risk of soil compaction was the main reason not to use organic fertilisers and based on the responses, pellets and granulates seem to be more interesting than liquids and solids in general. Animal manures dominate the current use of organic fertilisers in Sweden however, other types of organic waste such as digestate and digestate derived fertilisers seems appealing to Swedish farmers. In conclusion, from this survey with 62% of the respondees in crop production, we found several indications of that there is a potential for increased use of organic fertilisers in Sweden on farms with limited use today. We found an openness, a broad interest and a demand for different types of products of different forms and origin. Since this demand in the end will almost always depend on the price of products in relation to the price of mineral fertilisers, which are fluctuating, we see the need of policy incentives in order to stimulate initiatives for the development towards increased circularity of nutrients.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of mechanical subsoiling for alleviating subsoil compaction is controversially discussed, particularly due to the sensitivity of mechanically loosened soils towards re-compaction. In order to improve the alleviation potential by subsoiling it was hypothesized that the loss of soil stability by mechanical subsoiling of compacted soils can be reduced by top and subsoil liming. The primary objective was to evaluate whether (a) mechanical subsoiling (to a depth of 35 cm with a subsoiler or a plough with a pan-breaker) could alleviate compaction in a clayey Stagnosol and (b) whether liming could stabilize soil structure to minimize re-compaction. Undisturbed soil samples were collected to assess physical properties in both \"compacted\", \"subsoiled\", and \"limed\", as well as in untreated plots. The Compaction Verification Tool (CVT) identified potentially harmful soil compaction in the subsoil. The results showed that wheeling increased the extent of harmful subsoil compaction (from 8% to 33%) in the first year, which was accompanied with a reduction in crop yields. Subsoiling with a pan-breaker combined with high liming intensity improved soil physical properties and yields and may have mitigated re-compaction in the loosened subsoil. Nevertheless, it is expected to be not economically viable on the studied clay soil.",

The aims of this study were to determine the effect of foliar application of glycinebetaine on biomass accumulation and photosynthetic capacity of turnip rape (Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera) and pea (Pisum sativum L.). Experiments were carried out in a greenhouse and in the field, and records were taken on differentiation and emergence of floral organs. Biomass accumulation, relative growth rate (RGR), specific leaf area, leaf chlorophyll content, and nitrogen uptake were also measured for pea. In the experiment in the greenhouse, glycinebetaine application increased relative growth rate of both crops, especially when drought‐stressed and when recovering from drought. Application of 0.20 M glycinebetaine increased RGR of pea, recovering from drought, by 13% compared with untreated plants, while the RGR of the drought‐stressed pea increased by 45%, measured 14 days after glycinebetaine application. However, the difference in effect between treatments diminished one week later. The response of turnip rape was less marked than that of pea in the greenhouse experiment. The RGR of drought‐stressed turnip rape treated with 0.05 M glycinebetaine application was 10% higher than that of untreated drought‐stressed plants, being 6% in plants treated before recovery, and 17% under adequate watering. Glycinebetaine application also increased the RGR of both crops in field experiments. However, no clear effects of foliar application of glycinebetaine on duration of different development phases and emergence of floral organs were recorded in the field.

    "abstract": "Nordic plant breeders have selected superior genotypes and released new spring wheat cultivars throughout this century. However, the extent of phenotypic diversity that exists in this improved germplasm has not been accurately investigated. This study phenotypically assessed 75 selected cultivars released to farmers in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden within the last 10 decades. Grouping of cultivars was not related to their geographical origin or decade of release. The respective within‐cluster variances were always larger than the among‐cluster variances. The average phenotypic diversity for Nordic spring wheat germplasm was 0.22, which was not surprising because some newer cultivars were derived from older cultivars. There was a significant influence of geographical origin on days to heading, straw, grain and biomass weight, and kernel number. Likewise, the country × decade of release interaction was significant for all characteristics except plant height. These findings suggest that irrespective of location, Nordic breeders have reduced plant height in recently released cultivars at a rate of —0.5 cm year−1, thereby reducing lodging in this germplasm. There was no significant change in biomass, straw and kernel weight between old and new cultivars. Nonetheless, relative genetic gains in this germplasm during this century were significant for agronomic characteristics, such as days to heading (8%), plant height (36%), grain yield (20%), harvest index (19%), and number of kernels per unit area (18%). On average, the absolute genetic gain for grain yield was about 18.5 kg ha−1 year−1 Negative changes in days to heading (at a rate of —0.06 year−1) and plant height, and positive changes in harvest index (0.06% year−1), and kernels m‐2 (45 year−1) were associated with gains observed in grain yield, i.e. an early flowering plant with short straw, but many fertile tillers, had high grain yield. This sustained genetic gain could result from the accumulation of favourable alleles and intergenomic interactions between homologous loci during systematic plant breeding for grain yield.",

An over-optimal concentration of a cation acts antagonistically to the effect of other cations on plant nutrient uptake. Sometimes the soil solution reactions are complicated, and antagonism between anions becomes obvious.

Size frequency curves of dispersed and aggregated soil particles and of soil pores were calculated using numerical differentiation of sum curves, which were obtained from measured data through interpolation procedures. Soils which originated from water sediments had narrow peaks with approximately lognormal distribution of dispersed soil particles and of soil pores, reflecting the sorting action of the water. Moraine soils appeared to have broad and flat frequency curves of dispersed soil particles, some of which were bimodal or skewed. These soils exhibited a typical bimodal size distribution of soil pores. Degree of aggregation was determined primarily by the soil content of clay, 10% or more creating stable macroaggregates of 2–6 mm diameter. A comparison of the frequency curves for soil pore size to a generalized four-parameter mathematical expression relating matric potential and volumetric water content revealed that the model fitted the empirical data reasonably well for the well-sorted water-sedimented soils, while in the case of the bimodal pore size soils a deviation of differing magnitude was observed. From the investigation it is recommended that in most cases, quantities of particles and pores in soil should be related to size with frequency rather than cumulative expressions.",

Subsequent oxidation processes release high amounts of acidity to the soil and to adjacent watercourses. This study surveyed the effects of different lime applications on AS soil pH and runoff acidity in order to assess feasible mitigation strategies for AS soil areas. From an agricultural point of view the theoretical lime requirement of typical newly drained AS soils was observed to be 120–200 meq Ca/kg soil, corresponding to 13–22 tons of totally dissolved agricultural lime per hectare. Field studies indicated, however, that the actual lime requirement is almost twice as high owing to a slow and incomplete dissolution of the applied limestone powder. Reliming frequency seems to be controlled by the type of drainage, being 4–5 years in open drainage and over ten years in subsurface drainage. Liming reduced the contents of exchangeable Al, Mn and Zn, but did not affect the exchangeable Fe content in the studied AS soil. The postliming reduction in runoff acidity was more pronounced in areas drained by open ditches compared to those with subsurface drainage. Massive agricultural liming did not reduce runoff acidity enough to protect watercourses with valuable fisheries.",

Treatments comprised three replicates each and were as follows: untreated soil (control), two that received a Russian (SSR) and two that received a Swedish SS (SSS). The SS application based on N applied at rates of 100 (SSR1 and SSS1) and 300 (SSR3 and SSS3) mg N kg−1 dry soil, respectively. Soil metal levels determined immediately after mixing the soils with SS were markedly increased. However, cropping the soils strongly decreased their Cu, Zn and Pb levels, while leaving substantial amounts of residual Cd in the soils, regardless of the treatment. Metal uptake in shoots and roots was significantly (P = 0.05) enhanced by SS applications. Rates of metal uptake in roots were significantly (P = 0.05, n = 64) correlated with the pre‐cropping soil metal contents. The bulk of the metals absorbed by the plants remained in roots. On average, transport index defined as the percentage of total metal uptake (shoots + roots) that was translocated to the shoots, was about 40, 50, 30 and 20% for Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd, respectively. Cd uptake was highest in SSR3, while Cu and Pb uptakes were highest in SSS3 These results suggest that the SS may not be \"environmentally friendly\".",

In this study, Cd levels in soil and grain and factors influencing these variables were investigated in Skåne, the southernmost province in Sweden. In 1992, soils and winter wheat grain were sampled at sites distributed randomly over Skåne. Soil Cd contents were influenced only slightly by the pH, clay content and organic matter content of the soil, but were rather strongly correlated with soil contents of both Cu and Zn. Cadmium levels in grain were generally rather low owing to a prolonged summer drought. Still, in a few of the samples, mostly from sites with Cd-rich soils, Cd contents exceeded 100 μg kg−1. Also, at less extreme sites, grain Cd contents generally increased with the soil Cd content. The distribution of grain Cd contents was such that in a less dry year, also a portion of wheat grown on soils with a Cd content of only up to 50% above average may have Cd contents near or above 100 μg kg−1. A comparison with data from other investigations showed that Cd contents in both soil and grain were higher in Skåne than in other parts of Sweden. However, the difference in grain Cd contents was larger than the difference in soil Cd contents, indicating that Cd in soils may be more available in Skåne than in other parts of Sweden.",

In the first year calcium treatment did not reduce any physiological disorders or loss of marketable yield. In the second year calcium treatment reduced storage losses until four months after storage. Bitter pit in ‘Krameri Tuviõun’ was unaffected by calcium treatment, but physiological spot of ‘Krameri Tuviõun’ and superficial scald of ‘Talvenauding’ were reduced by calcium treatment in the second year. Both physiological disorders of 'Krameri Tuviõun’ correlated negatively with Mg and P content and Mg/Ca ratio in apples. Superficial scald of ‘Talvenauding’ correlated negatively with Ca content and positively with K/Ca ratio, N/Ca ratio and Mg/Ca ratio in fruits. The conclusion can be made that content of Ca and its ratios with other nutrients plays an important role in the development of superficial scald on ‘Talvenauding’ fruits, and increasing Ca content in fruit can therefore be recommended for improving post-harvest quality of this cultivar. Since bitter pit in 'Krameri Tuviõun’ was not reduced by calcium treatment, it would be worth trying other measures for this cultivar.",

    "abstract": "Spring wheat from a conventional (CONV) and an organic (ORG1) cropping system, both with animals, and from an organic system without animals (ORG2) was evaluated with respect to baking quality for the years 1995–2002. Amino acid (AA) composition was studied in both spring and winter wheat in 1993 and 2000–2002. The data were combined in multivariate analysis for exploration of the main factors responsible for the variation in quality. The most important factor for baking quality was weather conditions. High rainfall in May favoured baking quality in both cropping systems with animals, as did high temperature in May and high rainfall in July in the ORG1 system, and low rainfall in August in the CONV system. The only significant difference between the cropping systems was falling number, which was higher in ORG1 (252 s) than in CONV (205 s), probably due to a heavier CONV crop stand causing more difficult drying conditions. AA composition differed more between years than between cropping systems for both winter and spring wheat. The content of essential amino acids was high under the weather conditions associated with poor baking quality. The contents of threonine and leucine in spring wheat were significantly higher in ORG1, 1.76 and 8.11 g/100 g crude protein than in CONV, 1.63 and 7.72, respectively. In the interaction between AA and baking quality in spring wheat, it was possible to determine a correlation between phenylalanine, histidine, lysine and good baking properties. The primary effect was associated with weather conditions, but there was also an effect of differences between the cropping systems.",

Shoot and seed biomass and phosphorus (P) accumulation in seeds were lower in plants grown in the Cd polluted soil, and Cd uptake was higher than in plants grown in the non-polluted soil. There were differences between pea genotypes with respect to their uptake of Cd. Glomus intraradices inoculation increased mycorrhizal colonization of roots only in the polluted soil. Inoculation with R. leguminosarum or P. brassicacearum had no effect on plant growth or mycorrhizal colonization. A positive mycorrhizal effect existed on shoot and seed biomass in genotype VIR3429 grown in the polluted soil and on shoot biomass in genotype VIR4788 grown in the non-polluted soil. The VIR8456 treatment did not induce any response to inoculation with the mycorrhizal fungus in the soils. Seed P concentration increased in the non-polluted soil after inoculation with R. leguminosarum and the mixture of three inocula. Glomus intraradices and P. brassicacearum increased Cd concentration and total Cd in seeds of plants grown in the polluted soil. The results illustrate that 1) the ability of G. intraradices to improve pea growth in Cd polluted soil significantly depends on plant genotype, and 2) optimization of inoculations with beneficial microbes requires active interaction between the microbial components and the plant under specific soil conditions.",

    "abstract": "Meadows in highlands are an important source of feed for livestock especially when harvested as hay for the winter period. Hay production from meadows largely depends on water table and management practices. A study was conducted on meadows with different water table levels (L1: high, L2: medium, L3: deep) for investigating effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization (N0: 0, N75: 75, N150: 150, N225: 225 kg N ha−1) and cutting stage (CS1: pre-anthesis, CS2: anthesis, CS3: milk accumulation) on hay yield and botanical composition in 1997 and 1998. Dry matter (DM) production changed depending on water table levels among sites. DM production showed relatively small increases when cutting was delayed in L2 until cutting stage CS3. The DM production and crude protein (CP) yield increased in response to N application, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was the same in L1 and L2, but decreased in L3. N application slightly increased the ratio of grasses to legumes at L2 and L3. N had no effect on grass to legume ratio in the L1 location and L1 was dominated by rushes and sedges. As cutting was delayed in L1 and L2, the proportion of grasses increased, but rushes and sedges decreased. Fertilization practices have definite influences on botanical composition and production on meadows. Therefore, we propose 150 kg ha−1 nitrogen for flooded meadows to prevent N runoff, and 225 kg ha−1 for dry meadow in highlands. Cutting should be at the pre-anthesis stage.",

    "abstract": "Rape (Brassica napus L.) overwintering has been studied in Lithuania and elsewhere; however, data have been analysed separately without inetgration into a common evaluation system. In this work the chosen integrated evaluation method enabled us to make complex evaluation of rape readiness for overwintering in crops of different density. A comprehensive evaluation of rape readiness for overwintering in crops of different density was performed using experimental data of the years 2000–2002. The variances of the individual indicators were subdivided into scales of nine points, and means were assigned to these points. The resulting evaluation points (EP) were marked in a network diagram with the radius scaled from 1 to 9. Evaluation threshold (ET = 5 evaluation points) was also marked, indicating the border between positive and negative assessment. This method thus allows at one sight a distinct, reproducible illustration and evaluation of different indicators characterizing readiness for overwintering. Additionally, interactions between indicators and areas demarcated by the evaluation points of all indications are visualized in the network diagram. An integrated evaluation index (IEI), consisting of the average of evaluation points, its standard deviation and standard deviation of the average of the evaluation points below the ET, was calculated to make generalized data assessments. Comprehensive evaluation using 21 indicators of rape readiness for overwintering in crops of different density showed that importance of these indicators varied. Better plant readiness for overwintering in a crop of the lowest density was determined by high values of assessment of terminal bud height, root collar diameter and nutrient accumulation in the terminal bud compared with a more dense crop. The suitability of the integrated evaluation method in such cases highlights the establishment of very strong and significant correlation (r = 0.98, p≤0.01) between the number of plants that survived the winter and the average evaluation points of readiness for overwintering. The areas determined by values of all indicators, according to different crop densities and calculated integrated evaluation indices, showed that rape readiness for overwintering in a crop with a density of < 20 plants m−2 (IEI = 6.37–1.69–1.15) and with a density of 20.1–40 plants m−2 (IEI = 5.67–1.28–1.02) was better than the average one; in a crop with a density of 40.1–60 plants m−2 (IEI = 4.97–0.85–0.53) was equal to the average one; and in a crop with a density of 60.1–80 plants m−2 (IEI = 3.62–1.23–0.79) and with a density of 80.1–100 plants m−2 (IEI = 3.10–1.76–0.67) was worse than the average one. Very strong and significant correlation was established between the number of plants that survived winter and average of evaluation points of indicators determining rape overwintering.",

In the present study, five agropastoral treatments (maize monoculture, maize-soybean rotation, maize-soybean green manure rotation, native savanna, maize-agropastoral rotation) under two tillage systems (no tillage and minimum tillage) were investigated. Lower bulk density and higher total porosity for all treatments and soil layers were found in no-tillage compared to the minimum tillage system. Between the two tillage systems, significantly higher maize grain yields (p<0.1) were obtained under no-tillage agropastoral treatments compared to the same treatments under minimum tillage. Maize yields on native savanna soils were markedly lower than in the rest of the treatments, indicating the need for improved soil conditions in subsoil layers for root growth of maize.",

A total of 2589 leaf samples (367 from spring oats, 743 from spring barley, 1479 from predominant grass species) were collected from 44 fields of spring oats, 84 fields of spring barley, and 26 pastures. We found that isolates of barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV), barley yellow dwarf virus-MAV (BYDV-MAV) and cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV (CYDV-RPV) were present in these samples of spring cereals and pasture grasses. The most common isolates of barley yellow dwarf virus were BYDV-PAV and BYDV-MAV in both grasses and cereals, but there was a great difference between years and regions. The proportion of BYD symptomatic cereal samples that reacted positively in TAS-ELISA test was 9 to 15%. The overall BYDV/CYDV incidence in pasture grasses ranged from 2 to 19%. The incidence of BYDV/CYDV infection was higher in Festuca elatior than in other grass species. Isolates of CYDV-RPV were rather rare: only found in Lolium perenne and Dactylis glomerata among six grass species tested and more frequently in barley than oats. This paper reports the first quantitative survey of selected BYD-causing viruses in spring cereals and pasture grasses in Latvia and in the Baltic states. We conclude that three selected virus species are prevalent in spring cereals and pasture grasses in Latvia, although with great variation between years. Further studies are needed to obtain knowledge of the most critical factors that determine these fluctuations.",

The long-term management effects of cereal and ley rotations, crop residue removal and return and inorganic N application on ryegrass N uptake were investigated and related to soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Total plant N uptake during three months varied between 9 and 27 mg N kg−1 (23–67 kg N ha−1) and increased with SOC concentration and previous application levels of inorganic N. Soil from crop rotations with ley mineralized about 50% more N than soil from crop rotations with only cereals. Plant N uptake and SOC were not significantly affected by crop residue return.",

Physiological age was measured early and late in the storage period and field performance in the next season was studied at a northern site (short, cool season) and a southern site (relatively longer, warmer season). With respect to vigour, growth and yields, the results showed no significant superiority of seed from any latitude within Norwegian conditions, although some differences occurred among the seed origins. The physiological age, based on measurements of incubation periods, was clearly different early and late in the storage period and varied between cultivars. However, no systematic variation was found between latitudes. A physiological age index (Caldiz et al., 2001) was calculated from a formula using a combination of incubation periods and chronological age from haulm-killing. This index did not seem to reflect the actual physiological state of the seed in our case, probably due to the influence of the widely differing haulm-killing dates. The minor differences in physiological age and field performance between northern and southern seed contrast with the general opinion regarding physiological characteristics of northern seed. Further studies should focus on the influence of low growth temperatures and long days on physiological development during the dormant period.",

    "abstract": "A group of spring wheat cultivars originating from Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands was analysed for powdery mildew resistance. Using functional molecular markers, two alleles of the major resistance gene Pm3 were detected among the cultivars under the study. One of the alleles, Pm3d, was detected in the resistant cultivars 'Vinjett', 'SW Estrad', and 'Zebra', and in 'Tjalve', a cultivar of earlier release susceptible to the local population of powdery mildew. The second allele of Pm3 detected in the analysed group of cultivars was the allele Pm3f, rarely used in Europe. It was identified in the resistant cultivars 'Satu', 'Helle', and in the moderatively resistant cultivar 'Mahti'. Pm3f was found to be effective against the local population of powdery mildew in Estonia, while Pm3d provided no protective effect. Besides the Pm3d allele on chromosome 1A, monosomic analysis of the cultivar 'Vinjett',which is almost immune to powdery mildew, identified two additional loci on chromosomes 5D and 7D, respectively, presumably responsible for the high resistance in this cultivar. In contrast to the earlier cultivars, six recently released cultivars ('Vinjett', 'SW Estrad', 'Zebra', 'Satu', 'Helle', 'Meri') demonstrated a high resistance to the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis DC. f. sp. tritici both in the field and seedling tests, showing that the genetic basis of powdery mildew resistance in Nordic spring wheat has been improved noticeably in the last ten years.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The conception of an area's carrying capacity has proven to be a useful concept at various scales ranging from populations to the entire biosphere, and it appears to be a suitable definition for any level. For soil water-carrying capacity for vegetation (SWCCV), the concept evokes density-dependence research in arid and semi-arid regions. The term is increasingly being used among ecological disciplines but remains vague and elusive. We propose the following definition: the SWCCV is 'the maximum biomass of a given type of vegetation, under specific climatic conditions, soil texture, and management regime, that a given arid or semi-arid area can sustain without diminishing the capacity of soil water to support future generations. Models for assessing the SWCCV of an area of interest, though preliminary, can be classified into three types according to their construction: empirical, conceptual, and process models. Neither the empirical model nor the conceptual model can account for the dynamic interactions between soil water and vegetation for heterogeneous environmental matrices in arid and semi-arid regions. The physically based process model would enable us to effectively analyse and simulate the components of the SWCCV. While water cycle and photosynthesis are not properly integrated in such quantitative models, the effects of water stress on transpiration, carbon-assimilation rates, and its feedback into the water cycle are not generally represented. From our point of view, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles need to be modelled in detail and simultaneously, while considering feedbacks between vegetation growth and soil hydrological processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the past century, changes in cropping systems have led to selective pressure on weed flora. The number of competitive species with decreased susceptibility to herbicides has increased, at the cost of more susceptible species. For a long period, the economically important perennial weed species Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. and Sonchus arvensis L. have mainly been controlled by the herbicide MCPA (phenoxy-acetic acid), which stimulates the weed plant to abnormal growth. However, it has been reported from Sweden, Great Britain, Hungary and North America that C. arvense has become less susceptible to MCPA since the 1950s. Therefore, two greenhouse experiments were performed at Uppsala, Sweden with clones of C. arvense and S. arvensis. The purpose was to study whether ecotypes (clones) from high input farmland, where herbicides had been used intensively and regularly for a long time, were less susceptible to herbicide (MCPA) treatment than ecotypes from low input farmland. Sixty clones of C. arvense and 36 clones of S. arvensis were treated with nine different doses of MCPA. The results supported the suggestion that a shift towards less MCPA-susceptible ecotypes of C. arvense had occurred on high input farmland. Clone material from such farmland had, on average, significantly higher dry matter content after herbicide treatment than ecotypes from low input farmland. Similar decrease in susceptibility was not detected for S. arvensis. This was probably due to S. arvensis generally being less susceptible to MCPA than C. arvense. Sonchus arvensis has therefore being exposed to a lower selection pressure than C. arvense.",

Simple methods of tip- and stem-cutting and plant truncation introduced by EVIKA as well as in vitro micro plant cultivation on plastic rolls were used for field multiplication. The main objective of this paper is to analyse how the leaf area index (LAI) depends on the plant multiplication method, experimental year and variety of the meristem plants. The results for the other methods were compared with the results for the in vitro micro plants. Two local late potato varieties, Ants and Vigri, were used for this study, which was carried out in the EVIKA greenhouse and on an experimental field during 2005–2007. Analysis of the potato meristem plants grown under open-field conditions showed that the multiplication method and experimental year, as well as the variety, had a significant influence on LAI. Leaf area formation of the variety Vigri was more sensitive to unfavourable dry and excessively warm conditions as compared with the variety Ants. In 2005 the maximum LAI (averaged over all the multiplication methods and the two tested varieties) reached 3.4 m2 m−2, while in the dry and periodically very hot year 2006 the mean LAI was 2.3 m2 m−2 and in the meteorologically nearly optimal year 2007 it was 5.7 m2 m−2. Comparison of the multiplication methods showed that all the meristem plants multiplied by the three simple EVIKA methods and grown under field conditions had larger LAI values and crop photosynthetic potentials than did the in vitro micro plants, which were planted on plastic rolls directly from test tubes.",

However, there have been few studies in forested regions over the influence of land-use changes on volcanic soils (Andisols) and its simulation through models. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of native forest, pine plantation, and pasture on the C content and organic matter quality in an Andisol of the Chilean Patagonia, and to simulate the effects using the CO2FIX model. The model was calibrated to each land-use area, and C content was determined in lenga (Nothofagus pumilio) and pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees using previously derived allometric equations, and in pasture by direct measurement. The C content was measured in soils (0–100-cm depth) (Typic Hapludands; Umbric Andosols), and the light (>212 µm), intermediate (212–53 µm), and heavy (<53 µm) fractions of organic matter (0–40-cm depth) which have progressively lower labilities. Total C (vegetation + soil) in the lenga forest was greater than in the pine plantation or pasture, but the C content in soil was greater in the pasture than in the other areas. Over all sites, there was more C in the light fraction than in the intermediate and heavy fractions at 0–5-cm depth, but C content was greater in the heavy fraction with increasing soil depths. However, the quality of soil organic matter was better in the lenga forest compared with the other sites, as indicated by higher ratios of light fraction C between 0–20- and 20–40-cm depths. CO2FIX adequately simulated the C contents in the vegetation, and recalibration for slower degradation rates of soluble organic compounds in Andisols provided better approximation of C content in soil, but overestimated the content of labile C.",

The investigations were carried out after completing one generation of whitefly based on two points of view. Initially, host preference and suitability of whitefly was investigated based on adult feeding, oviposition, and developmental time. Therefore, it was investigated based on growth responses of eggplant. The average developmental time was shortest for the cohort reared in 'Dafeng' (21.3 days), while the longest period (23.2 days) was recorded in 'Baiyu'. In comparison with the control, less significant changes in the six growth parameters, viz. plant height (12.6%), leaf area (12.7%), dry matter (8.2%), absolute growth rate (26.0%), relative growth rate (25.0%), and net assimilation rate (22.2%) were found in 'Baiyu' infested by B. tabaci. Adult attraction and oviposition were reduced while developmental time was increased in 'Baiyu' compared with the other two varieties. In addition, the reduction percentages of all the six plant-growth parameters of 'Baiyu' were comparatively less than other two varieties to whitefly stress. Our research is focused on a shorter development time; higher feeding, oviposition, and the reduction percentage of plant growth indicate that a plant is a suitable host. In view of this, the present findings indicate that 'Baiyu' is less susceptible than the other two varieties, 'Dafeng' and 'Beisite', for whitefly infestation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) is grown as a forage crop on many livestock farms. In calcareous soils in eastern Turkey, lucerne production requires boron (B) addition as the soils are naturally B deficient. Field experiments with four B-application rates (0, 1, 3, and 9 kg ha−1 B) were conducted in 2005 and 2006 to determine the optimum economic B rate (OEBR), critical soil test and tissue B values for dry matter (DM) production for lucerne grown on B-deficient calcareous aridisols in eastern Turkey. Boron application increased yield at each site in both years of production. The OEBR and critical soil and tissue B content were not impacted by location. Averaged over the two years and three locations, the OEBR was 6.8 kg B ha−1 with an average DM yield of 12.0 Mg ha−1. The average soil B content at the OEBR was 0.89 mg kg−1 while leaf and shoot tissue B content amounted to 51.8 and 35.5 mg kg−1, respectively. Boron application decreased tissue calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu), and increased tissue nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn). Tissue and soil B increased without impacting yield at B levels up to 9 kg ha−1. We conclude that 7 kg ha−1 B is sufficient to elevate soil test B levels from 0.11 to 0.89 mg kg−1 and overcome B deficiency at each of the sites in the study. Similar studies with different soils and initial soil test B levels are needed to conclude if these critical soil and tissue values can be applied across the region.",

Each quadrat was classified into 'spray' and 'not spray' decisions based on a threshold model, and the resulting map defined the 'ground truth'. Subsequently, 'on/off' spraying at larger control areas where sizes were given by the boom width and image distance, and spraying decision controlled by weed status at the single quadrat simulating the camera's view, were simulated. These coarser maps were compared with 'ground truth', to estimate mapping error (area above threshold not sprayed), spraying error (area below threshold sprayed), total error (sum of mapping and spraying error) and the herbicide reduction. Three levels of the threshold model were tested. Results were used to fit models that predict errors from boom width and image distance. Size of control area did not on average affect the magnitude of the simulated herbicide reductions, but the bigger the control area the higher the risk that the simulated herbicide reduction deviate from the reduction in 'ground truth'. Mean simulated herbicide reductions were 42–59%, depending on threshold level. Only minor differences due to threshold level were seen for mean mapping and spraying errors at given spraying resolutions.

One study of the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial analysis and geostatistic analysis was carried out in the catchment. The results showed that the trend of the content of clay and silt in the different soil ranks was: farmland < grassland < shrub land < gully soil. The sandy soil contained fewer nutrients than did the other soils. The farmland contains fewer total phosphorus (TP) and . The spatial dependence of the total nitrogen (TN) and the organic matter (OM) in the sandy soil is strong, but is only moderate in the other types of land use except for OM in farmland.

Regional N-strategy field trials in such areas generally show no relationship between early N and grain yield but the effects on shoot numbers and other yield components are seldom investigated. This study quantified the effect of three N fertilization strategies on the number of tillers at GS30-31 and the grain yield of winter wheat with low shoot density in early spring, in order to evaluate the importance of early N application. The investigations were carried out from 1999–2002 in four annual field experiments on a clay soil in south-west Sweden using winter wheat (cvs. Kosack and Tarso) with shoot densities in early spring ranging from 360–850 shoots m−2. A positive relationship between time of first N application as number of days before GS30 and increase in number of shoots from GS20-21 to GS30-31 was observed. The relationship was strongest in experiments with the lowest shoot density in early spring (360–560 shoots m−2) and the additional increase with each day of earlier availability of N before GS30 was 11 shoots m−2. In wheat with this low shoot density in early spring, N was needed before GS30 to avoid yield reductions. Whether N was applied and available 24 or 13 days before GS30 did not affect yield, despite significantly more shoots being present at GS30-31 with earlier N application.",

The objective of this study was to investigate rice's response to different rates and times of phosphorus fertilizer. A field trial was conducted in a farmer's field with a split plot design. Main plots were established using three rates: 15, 30, and 60 kg P ha−1. Five types of sub-plot were established as follows: (1) P fertilizer was applied by banding below the seeds' depth before seeding (BBS), (2) broadcasting and incorporation into the soil before seeding, and (3) topdressing at three different DAS (days after seeding). Fertilizer was spread onto the soil surface at 10, 20, and 30 DAS. Significant grain-yield increases were affected by time or rate of fertilizer application. Grain yields were maximized by a rate of 60 kg P ha−1. Fertilizer application by BBS produced higher grain yield than did other treatments, giving higher root-length density and shoot growth, phosphorus uptake, and greater phosphorus-use efficiency than did fertilizer applied by broadcasting or delayed topdressing. BBS resulted in the highest phosphorus enrichment in soil volume with a rate of 60 kg P ha−1. The high solubility of fertilizer in a localized placement may satisfy the seedlings' high initial demand of phosphorus and provide sufficient phosphorus availability to allow high productivity. Based on these data, in regions with low soil phosphorus availability where rainfall is also erratic, the management of sub-seed banding placement at the start of a crop at the rate of 60 kg P ha−1 is recommended as the optimum phosphorus fertilizer practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The issue of soil organic carbon (SOC) is of increasing concern. Because SOC, as an important soil component in farming systems, is essential for improving soil quality, sustaining food production and quality, and maintaining water quality and as a major part of the terrestrial carbon reservoir, it plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. In this paper, a total of 665 soil samples from different depths were collected randomly in the autumn of 2007, and the spatial variability of SOC content at a small catchment of the Loess Plateau was analysed using classical statistics and geo-statistical analysis. In nonsampled areas classical kriging was utilized for interpolation of SOC estimation. The classic statistical analysis revealed moderate spatial variability with all five layers of SOC-content. In addition, the average SOC content decreased with soil depth and the relationship can be modelled by an exponential equation (y=3.1795x −1.2015, R 2=0.9866) and all of the SOC-content data in the different depth were normally distributed. The geo-statistical analysis indicated a moderate spatial dependence in 0–60 cm, while in the 60–80 cm depth spatial dependence was strong. The semi-variogram could be fitted by an exponential model for 0–10 cm depth; by a spherical model for 10–20 cm depth and 60–80 cm depth; and by a Gaussian model for 20–60 cm depth. The range increases with increasing depth. In addition, classical kriging could successfully interpolate SOC content in the catchment. In general, the geo-statistics method on a watershed scale could be accurately used to evaluate spatial variability of the SOC content in the Loess Plateau, China.",

    "abstract": "In South Africa, chickpea is becoming one of most consumed pulses but its demand is currently met through imports. In general, the imported chickpea grain is likely costly with a relatively lower nutritional value as is largely the case with most imported food products. In this review paper, we discuss how its production in South Africa would improve the nutritional status of humans and livestock and enhance the fertility status of cropping fields. Other benefits include that its production would be of financial reward to local farmers and ensure better nutritional quality and boost the country's economy and global competiveness. Studies conducted in South Africa have assessed the crop's suitable planting season and where planted in winter, irrigation has sustained its growth. We discuss challenges of its plantation in the dry winter season given the on-going water restrictions on agricultural activities, drought, low water levels in dams, and water scarcity. Suggestions include identification of low-temperature locations and fields experiments be established to assess the crop's adaptation to summer cropping. Field studies conducted locally have also included the nutritional requirements of chickpea. The review discusses possible solutions to low soil fertility suggest the use of plant biostimulants for enhanced fertiliser use.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Roses are one of the ornamental species of major importance and economic value. Fertilisation programmes which maximise plant growth and quality, while minimising environmental impact are important. Here, we followed the N and K dynamics during rose development with the aim to define the nutrient demands as a basis for implementing fertigation programmes.Materials and methods: Roses with one basal break were grown in a closed hydroponic system. Destructive samples were taken to determine dry weight, N and K content. In each sample, plants were sectioned into roots, rootstock, basal break, stems and leaves from the zone of active leaves and the zone of cutting flowers, as well as the flower bud in the latter.Results: The shoots of the active leaves and cutting flowers zones exhibited a biphasic growth; dry weight, N and K increased after pruning of the zone of active leaves and the cutting flowers zone, however, in the second phase, total dry weight did not show a significant difference between the phenological phases, while the accumulation of N and K decreased throughout the entire plant.Conclusions: Our results suggest that greenhouse roses develop a dynamic and complex balance between the aerial parts of the plants and the roots for storage and/or transport of photoassimilates, N and K. The total demand for N was 411 and 799 mg per plant for the initial shoot development of the active leaf zone and cutting flowers zone, respectively. The demand for K was 149 and 106 mg per plant for both shoots, respectively. The loss of N (555 mg per plant) and K (167 mg per plant) from roses plants to the root environment implies that lower fertiliser inputs can be used as these nutrients may be re-uptaken by new emerging roots.",

The study aim was to investigate the effect of the growth harvest stage, postharvest storage duration and temperature on quality of baby spinach leaves. A 3 × 5 × 3 factorial experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design with four replicates per treatment. The treatments were arranged as follows namely: stage I [28 days after sowing (DAS)], stage II (35 DAS)and stage III (42 DAS), and leaves were kept up to 12 d at three different temperatures – 4, 10 and 20°C. The study demonstrated that the overall appearance and odour were both well maintained in the leaves of baby spinach harvested at stage II. The baby spinach harvested 28 DAS led to higher content of iron [1.13 mg g−1 dry weight (DW)], magnesium (14.4 mg g−1 DW), and zinc (0.17 mg g−1 DW). The highest level of total antioxidant activity (0.43 mg g−1 DW) and flavonoids (12 mg g−1 DW) after 12 d of storage was observed in baby spinach leaves at stage I when stored at 4°C. Therefore, baby spinach leaves harvested 28 DAS and store at 4°C for 6 d improved shelf life and nutraceutical quality. Thus, early harvest of fresh produced baby spinach harvested in order to attain high phytochemical and mineral content when stored at low temperature (4°C) without exceeding 6 days is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Taro [Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott] is an important underutilised staple food crop in South Africa, with a lot of potential to address food insecurity among poor rural households. Development of high yielding stable taro cultivars is one of the most important goals of plant breeders. Twenty-nine taro accessions collected from major taro producing regions of the country were evaluated for growth performance, yield potential and stability under dryland conditions at two sites (Umbumbulu and Roodeplaat) in 2013, 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons. The experiment was laid in a randomised complete block design replicated three times. Growth and yield traits were measured. Analysis of variance and correlation analysis was done on all measured traits. The genotype by environment interaction was analysed using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI). As a result, significant variation was observed for most of the traits except number of leaves and leaf width as well as number of suckers, while all the traits showed significant variation for location by year interaction. Number of corms showed significant variation for location by year by genotype interaction among all the traits evaluated. Genotype effect was highly significant (p < .01) on plant height, corm length, number of corms and significant (p < .05) on yield. The significant difference between genotypes for these traits proves that there was a genetic variability and there is a scope for selection. The correlation study also reveals that majority of the characters were positively correlated with each other. Total yield was positively and highly significantly (p < .01) correlated with all the measured traits. AMMI was effective in identifying stable genotypes. The top ranking cultivars per environment may be considered for cultivation under the specific environment, the stable cultivars may be considered for cultivation across all the taro growing regions.",

Application of fertilizers and pesticides can improve the aesthetics of a home lawn, improve turfgrass shoot and root density, water use, organic matter accumulation, and other factors known to be influential in urban hydrology. A field study determined the impact of applying home landscape pesticides with or without supplemental irrigation of leaching into groundwater or runoff to surface water. Free-draining lysimeters having a sandy loam soil (coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Lamellic Hapludalf) were used to monitor total volume and nutrients and pesticides losses. Samples from natural precipitation events were analysed for pendimethalin [N-(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4-dimethyl-2, 6-dinitrobenzenamine] applied in spring, mecoprop [2-(4-Chloro-2-methylphenoxy) propionic acid]+2, 4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) applied both in late spring and early fall, and bifenthrin [(2-methyl-1,1-biphenyl-3-y1)-methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate] applied in late summer. Pesticide concentrations fluctuated over time, but no differences in concentrations were observed from irrigated or non-irrigated turfgrass for any pesticide. Mecoprop and 2,4-D were the most mobile and values found in runoff during establishment were above maximum contaminant levels (MCL) for U.S. standards. Surface runoff of lawn pesticides were observed at concentrations several magnitudes higher than leachate. The total extent of pesticide runoff was 0.71%, 1.3%, 6.0%, and 0.003% of the amount applied for 2,4-D, mecoprop, pendimethalin and bifenthrin, respectively. With the exception of one sampling period, pendimethalin concentrations in runoff and leachate were low; however, when applied during a period of minimal turf growth and high precipitation, pendimethalin could contribute significantly to surface water pollution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Warm season turfgrasses are increasingly used throughout the transitional areas of Mediterranean countries due to their low water requirements. A two-year field study was carried out in north-eastern Italy to evaluate the turf canopy quality and root system architecture of three seeded bermudagrass cultivars (La Paloma, Princess-77 and Yukon), and a zoysiagrass (Companion) under non-irrigated conditions. Plots (1.6×4.5 m) were established in July 2005 and arranged in a randomized complete block with three replicates. Visual quality ratings were assessed weekly from April to November in 2006 and 2007. Soil cores were collected at depths of 0–3, 3–8, 8–15, 15–25 and 25–40 cm in August 2006, January 2007, May 2007 and September 2007 to measure main rooting characteristics: root length density (RLD), root mass density (RMD) and root diameter. Companion zoysiagrass had higher canopy quality than bermudagrass cultivars in early spring and in the late growing season, while it displayed poorest quality from June to October. Among the bermudagrass cultivars, Yukon showed the highest quality in both years. Differences in RLD among grasses appeared to be related to seasonal changes in air temperature and precipitation. In August 2006 Companion zoysiagrass averaged 3.5–4.4 cm cm−3 less RLD than bermudagrass cultivars La Paloma and Princess-77. Visual turf quality was positively correlated to the RLD and RMD in the 25–40 cm soil layer, whereas no correlations were found with root diameters nor any parameter collected in the upper soil layers. Deep-rooting cultivars may have an advantage in deficit soil moisture periods resulting in higher quality turf throughout the year.",

    "abstract": "We have established for the first time that Colorado potato beetle (CPB) (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) produced a distinct second generation in 2010 in Estonia. This species has a history, in Estonia, of less than 50 years. Due to their great ability to adapt to variable environmental conditions, the beetles spread very quickly throughout the country and established a permanent population in the 1980s. Before 2010, CPB has been predominantly univoltine. The occurrence of the second generation was the result of rare coincidence of extremely favourable weather as the cumulative degree days (DD) of 927 exceeded the sum needed for two full generations. Constantly high temperatures from the beginning of May caused the formation of summer generation adults already by the end of July and the long day photoperiod, as well the availability of fresh food, kept the beetles in reproductive mode preventing the onset of diapause. Summer beetles continued to oviposit up to the second half of September, but a large proportion of the second generation was eliminated from the population in the pre-adult or adult stages as they failed to end their development in the favourable period. Successful overwintering with about 50% survivors occurred only in association with completed development which was restricted to August and the beginning of September. An abundant second generation has potential to reduce primarily the yield of late potato cultivars. However, the unpredictable weather conditions in Estonia does not allow exact prediction of the appearance of a second generation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Natural peatlands are an important source of berries in northern countries. One possible avenue to improve crop yield in natural peatlands is to apply fertilizers, ombrotrophic peatlands being very low in nutrients. In order to reduce the impact of this practice on an otherwise natural habitat, slow-release organic fertilizers might be more appropriate than mineral fertilizers. However, mineralization and dispersion of organic fertilizers in peatlands need to be determined along with their impact on crop yield. In the present study, we focused on cloudberry fruit that despite a high commercial potential is limited by low and variable yield. We thus tested the effect of an organo-mineral fertilizer in two peatlands on nutrient dispersion, plant growth, flowering frequency and fruit yield of cloudberry. The organo-mineral fertilizer, composed of crab and fish meal supplemented with potassium chloride, was applied annually for three years. The treatment was repeated in two natural ombrotrophic peatlands: one covered with lichen and the other a more typical sphagnum bog. The dispersion study indicated very limited dispersion of most nutrients. There was no effect of the fertilizer on cloudberry growth and fruit yield or on the nutrient concentrations of its tissues. We concluded that the fertilizer did not mineralize to sufficient extent. Mineralization of potential organic fertilizers would need to be tested in natural peatlands before being applied to cloudberry patches.",

In South Africa, due to high labour costs, most cotton farmers are turning to watermelon production. In these regions, there is high incidence of M. incognita race 4. A pot experiment in the greenhouse was, therefore, initiated to investigate the host-status and host-sensitivity of Cucumis africanus and Cucumis myriocarpus to M. incognita race 4, when inoculated with 0, 200, 600, 100, 1400, 1800 and 2200 eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2s). At harvest, 56 days after inoculation, the reproductive factor values at all levels of inoculation were less than one. Penetration indices on both plant species were greater than one, suggesting that the resistance was post-infectional and therefore, introgressible. Sex (male: female) ratios of M. incognita race 4 on the two Cucumis species were greater than one, suggesting that more J2s were converted into males. Infection of Cucumis species by the test nematode had no effect on yield components of the two plant species due to poor feeding sites. The two Cucumis species were, therefore, resistant to M. incognita race 4, with post-infectional resistance, where the sex ratio was skewed towards maleness. Thus, the two Cucumis species have the potential to be used as nematode-resistant rootstocks in watermelon production.",

Two nutrient solutions characterized by the same ion ratio but macronutrient concentration equal to 100% or 60% were adopted. The total yield did not differ between the treatments; however the lower concentration of nutrients determined a significant reduction of incidence of unmarketable fruits (blossom-end rot) and thus a higher marketable production (+15%). Within the fruit quality characteristics the dry matter content and the titratable acidity were significantly higher adopting the full strength nutrient solution. Important differences were found when the agronomic water use efficiency was considered: the weight of marketable pepper produced per m3 of water input was about 32% higher using the reduced concentration treatment according to the lower volume of water released in the environment due to the lower renewal of recirculated nutrient solution. A similar pattern was observed for the use efficiency of the main nutrients. With reduced strength nutrient solution the amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium released per ton of marketable tomatoes were respectively 83%, 80% and 81% lower than the control. The use of a reduced strength nutrient solution in soilless closed system for pepper cultivation did not influence the total yield and improved the use efficiency of water and minerals. Moreover, the environmental impact of the system was drastically reduced.",

Although this could be achieved through the use of mineral fertilizers, reports indicate limited effects of these inputs on tuber yield. We hypothesized (i) that D. rotundata has a small and shallow root system and (ii) that this root system does not respond to mineral fertilizer application. Two field experiments were conducted in Côte d'Ivoire in year 1 and in year 2 to test these hypotheses. In the first field experiment we measured biomass production, as well as root density during plant growth in fertilized and unfertilized plots while in the second experiment, we analysed the distribution pattern of roots in horizontal and vertical root profiles in fertilized plots. The root system of D. rotundata consisted of seminal, adventitious and tubercular roots. Only the adventitious roots remained alive until the end of the growth cycle. The root length density was very low with a maximum of 0.25 cm cm−3. No roots were observed in the 15–30 cm horizon at 50 cm from the plant's crown. The horizontal and vertical root maps revealed that roots were mostly distributed in clumps, and there was a good correlation between the two methods of root sampling for this species. Fertilizer application had no significant effect on plant biomass, fresh tuber yield or on root growth. However, thinner and longer roots and higher tuber yields were observed in year 1 than in year 2. The different weather conditions and more specifically the higher soil temperature might explain the results obtained in year 1. Therefore, it could be recommended to farmers not to fertilize D. rotundata.",

Crops studied were barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oilseed rape (Brassica napus var. oleifera, L., Metzg.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.). For harmful oxygen deficiency to develop it appeared that rainfall would need to cause structural collapse of the surface layer followed by continuously wet weather accompanied by slow drainage and high oxygen consumption in the soil; in the experiments the latter was achieved by large amounts of easily decomposable organic matter. It was concluded that such conditions are rare in the field. Therefore, unless rainfall after sowing generates surface water for an extended period, the poor crop emergence often observed after such rainfall is nearly always caused not by oxygen deficiency, but by surface layer hardening when this layer dries.",

DGGE profiles of various rhizosphere soils showed six major bacterial populations: Proteobacteria, Sphingobacteria, Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, Clostridia, and Acidobacteria. The yield of cucumber in the kidney bean–celery–cucumber rotation was higher than in other crop rotations (p<0.05). Cucumber yield was strongly and positively correlated with soil microorganism diversity index (p<0.01), and was also positively correlated with evenness index (p<0.05). Our results suggest that the kidney bean–celery–cucumber rotation is suitable for cucumber cropping.",

    "abstract": "Accounts of the ‘quality turn’ in agro-food literature suggest that there is a potential for growth in the market for ‘high-quality’ food, which utilises distinct notions like ‘quality’ and ‘place.’ These food chains are typically described as ‘alternative.’ Alterity might stem from alternative social or physical geographies of such food chains. This study is focused on exploring whether the utilisation of different notions of quality in emerging producer–consumer networks also translates into new patterns of rural development. This paper is based on data on various sub-sectors of Danish food chains on municipality scale for the period 2000–2005. Specifically, this study seeks to identify whether this is the case in the Danish context. First, the analysis considers the economic geography of Danish food chains on national level. Second, a deviant case on a regional level is considered, which runs counter to the trends on national level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article probes a number of recent national policy documents in order to capture how sustainability is perceived and expressed in the context of food and what role is given to the alternative food supplies. The goals of food policy and their realization are discussed by reflecting the results from the policy document analysis against the actual use of alternative food in the statutory municipal catering services in Finland. In the policy documents the concept of sustainable development has remained rather abstract; various dimensions such as food security, affordability and access to food, cultural and health aspects are mentioned, but these are not necessarily identified as elements of sustainability. Local and organic foods appear as important items in food sustainability. However, in the documents they are usually not differentiated from each other, and positioning of local food in relation to domestic and regional food is not clear. The municipal caterers instead, identify organic as distinct from local and they are interested in locally produced staple food products, but the (labeled) local specialities – locality food – are not relevant within the public catering services. Use of organic food is also marginal. Defining sustainability in the context of food is a prerequisite for coherent food policy. The development needs and possibilities are different in different municipalities, and the same approach cannot be offered to all, but the problems need to be addressed in the concrete situations. With the small population basis and long distances, it is worthwhile to aim at solutions relying on local resources. Food strategy should be included as part of the comprehensive municipal development strategies. It is important to involve practical actors in developing the food sector and in formulating quantitative goals.",

A completely randomized design was subjected to three water regimes (80%, 40% and 20% water field capacity (FC)) and three N supply regimes (control, N0: 0 mg N kg−1 soil; low N supply, Nl: 92 mg N kg−1 soil; and high N supply, Nh: 184 mg N kg−1 soil) by potting with 2-month-old Sophora davidii seedlings. Water stress decreased the content of soil organic carbon (C), available N and phosphorus (P), the ratio of C/N, the ratio of C/P, as well as activities of soil invertase, urease and alkaline phosphatase, but not reduced microbial biomass C, N and P contents. Soil microbial and chemical characteristics also exhibited strong responses to N supply, and these responses were inconsistent among N supply levels. The contents of soil organic C and available P showed stronger positive responses to Nl than to Nh, while the available N content increased with increasing N supply. Additionally, Nl rather than the other two N treatments led to increased microbial biomass N and invertase activity under 20% FC treatment, even though the invertase activity increased in Nh treatment under 40% FC and 80% FC treatments. Nl treatment also increased the C/P ratio and alkaline phosphatase activity. These results suggest that water and N co-limited nutrient mineralization and microbial activity, and that these characteristics responded positively to Nl. Therefore, appropriate or low N supply is recommended to increase soil quality restrained by water stress, thereby facilitating S. davidii seedling establishment under water deficit conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The large-scale industrial agriculture that provides the majority of food at present is dependent upon fossil fuels in the form of tractor fuel, mineral fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation. Yet, the age of cheap and abundant fossil fuels will likely come to an end within the coming decades. In this case study, the productivity of a small-scale farm (8 ha arable land, 5.5 ha meadow, 3.5 ha pasture and 18 ha forest) independent on fossil fuels by using organic methods and draught horse power was investigated. The aim was to quantify its productivity when the animal composition and possible alternatives to tractive power were varied. After an analysis of possible solutions, three scenarios for tractive power were selected: draught horse power, diesel tractor, and combination of draught horse power and rapeseed oil fueled tractor. A model that calculates the amount of food available at the farm in terms of meat, milk egg, and crops, converts it into energy units and calculates how many people can be supplied from the farm was developed. The most reasonable of the scenarios studied was when draught horse power was combined with tractor (and combine harvester) driven on locally produced rapeseed oil. Then the farm will have access to all advantages with the tractor and harvester, e.g., timeliness in harvest and lifting heavy loads, and the renewability and efficiency of draught horse power on smaller fields, and lighter operations. This system was able to support between 66 and 82 persons depending on crop yields, milk yields, meat production, fuel demand for the tractor, and availability of forest grazing. Most likely the production capacity lands on ability to support approximately 68–70 persons, and the farm may require fossil fuels to support more than 80 persons. If all farmland globally was to be operated with the same productivity, this would be enough for supplying the global population with food at present.",

Field experiments were conducted at two locations on haplic Luvisol and calcaric Cambisol during five years. S was given as NS-fertilizers on the background of N100 during wheat tillering. Flour and dough properties for bread-making were determined by using a farinograph Brabender. The baking tests were carried out in laboratory conditions. The influence of S on the grain yield and quality, and bread-making properties of wheat depended on the year and location. As the average of field experiments conducted at two locations, the application of S significantly increased the grain yield (r = 0.960). The increasing yields were accompanied by decreasing contents of wet gluten (r = 0.825). However, the significant positive (r = 0.938) effect of the S application on the Gluten index was revealed, which is a good predictor of the baking quality of wheat flour. The S addition by nitrogen fertilization resulted also in a positive shift of the N:S ratio in grains, which is better for the bread-making quality. The significant positive effects of the S application on the dough stability time (r = 0.898) and on the farinograph quality number (r = 0.917) were demonstrated. The loaf volume was significantly (r = 0.842) increasing under the influence of S. Thus, the application of S in parallel with increasing yields improved several bread-making parameters of wheat.",

For the 2C managements, three timings of the first cut were implemented corresponding to growth stages of pre-heading (2C-early), inflorescence emergence (2C-mid), and flowering (2C-late). Anaerobic digestion batch assays with biomass samples were run for 68 days, showing that 90% of total methane (CH 4) was produced within 38 days. Specific methane yield ranged from 315 to 464 NL CH 4kg −1 volatile solids (mean, 393 NL). On average, SMY of the final cut biomass was 13% lower than the first cut biomass. Methane yield per hectare ranged from 5277 to 6963 Nm 3CH 4ha −1 (mean, 6265 Nm 3) and was predominantly influenced by biomass yield since SMY only deviated modestly in relation to harvest management (crop maturity). Methane yield per hectare of festulolium under 3C and 2C-late management were significantly higher than 2C-early and 2C-mid managements, whereas the harvesting managements did not influence MYPH of tall fescue. The levels of SMY and MYPH in the present study represented high-end of reported values due to a combination of high activity of the biogas inoculum and a high productivity of festulolium and tall fescue at the riparian fen peatland.",

Lycium ruthenicum Murr (LRM), with significant nutritional and medicinal values, is one of the most important native halophytes in the arid oasis-desert transition zone of northwestern China. In recent years, artificially planting LRM has been being popular since it can improve saline-alkalized soil and increase the income of local farmers as well. More efforts about the artificial planting of LRM are put in enhancing the productivity and quality, but survivorship of LRM seedling by appropriate saline irrigation is still unclear in arid areas. A field experiment was conducted to explore the responses of LRM to four levels of saline water irrigation (Ec of irrigation water: 2.00 μs cm−1 (T1), 4.51 μs cm−1 (T2), 6.89 μs cm−1 (T3), and 9.00 μs cm−1 (T4)) during the growing seasons in 2014 and 2015. The average soil electrical conductivity (Eca) in 0–60 cm depth increased while the biomass of LRM decreased with increasing Ec of irrigation water, and the differences of Eca among treatments decreased with increasing salinity level. In contrast to previous research findings, salt stress had more significant effect on photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence of LRM, in which great changes were caused by a threshold following the increased salinity. Most of the light energy absorbed by LRM was used for photosynthesis and heat dissipation when soil salinity was low, what was used for chlorophyll fluorescence when soil salinity was high. The results of the experiment indicate that T2 was the most suitable irrigation method for artificially planting LRM in the field, and it's the key to save freshwater resources in arid areas and improve the production of saline-alkali land.",

In addition, the rootstocks were either defeathered (side shoots removed), topped (top shoot headed) or both, to create wounds that would normally occur during propagation, while wounds on transplants were made by removing leaves.Results and discussion: One month after inoculation, slightly sunken canker lesions had developed around the inoculation points of the map pins or wounds. No lesions developed on the non-inoculated controls. Map pin inoculation resulted in 30% to 89% infection and spore suspension sprayed on wounds from 5% to 45% infection. When the cankered areas were split open, brown lesions with necrotic tissue due to infection by N. ditissima appeared. The transplants of M9, M26 and MM106 inoculated with contaminated map pins in 2014 developed necrosis on 40% to 67% of the plants, but there were no differences in the incidence or severity among the different types. On the transplants of B9, Antonovka and M9 inoculated in 2015, there was more necrosis on B9 (42%) than on Antonovka (11%) and more sporulating lesions on B9 (29%) than on M9 (9%) or on Antonovka (4%).Conclusion: It can be concluded that rootstocks used for apple trees may become infected by N. ditissima, and wounds should thus be protected during propagation.",

The various statistical tools used in this study have allowed us to present another conceptualisation of nutrient increments or losses as an effect of SSC applied. In order to distinguish groups of nutrients which are similar, a cluster analysis was used. A two-way analysis of variance was applied to compare the increments of the content of nutrients in the soils.Material and Methods: A 3-year pot experiment was conducted, employing a randomised, factorial design with two soils (light and medium) and one amendment treatment as a compost at a rate equivalent to 6 Mg ha−1. The following parameters of chemical soil properties were determined: contents of organic carbon (Corg), total nitrogen (Ntot), amounts of available P, K, Mg, S and mineral nitrogen (Nmin).Results: The SSC showed a similar influence on the fertility of both soils. It was affirmed that application of SSC results in a statistically significant increase in the contents of soil organic carbon. The amounts of total and mineral N, as well as available P and S were subjected to different patterns of quantity changes expressed by both increase and loss. Moreover, a statistically significant loss of available K amounts was observed in both soils.Conclusions: The findings of the study indicated that mature SSC becomes a long lasting fertiliser, slowly subjected to decomposition processes. Therefore, it may influence small increases in nutrient amounts in soils, in relation to the contents obtained for the control soil.",

From substrates of wild seaweed and organic waste digestate, we measured the distribution of solids (hydrochars) and liquids after HTL at 150 and 200°C, 50 bar for 1 h. The output of liquids and solids was recorded. Elemental analysis was conducted for essential plant nutrients, potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and silicon in the hydrochars. Sequential extraction of phosphorous (P) was conducted to assess the P availability for plants. About 20% of the initial dry matter dissolved during HTL of digestate, and 55% for seaweed. More dry matter was dissolved by increased temperature. Except from arsenic in seaweed chars, the concentrations of PTEs were below quality compost thresholds. About 85% of P was recovered in chars for digestate. For seaweed, the recovery was 97% at 150°C, decreasing to 84% at 200°C. The solubility of P in chars decreased by HTL, and more with higher temperature. Reduced P availability, especially by higher temperature, is negative for the immediate fertilization effect. However, for soil sequestration of carbon, reduced P availability in hydrochars may expand the area where application may occur without negative environmental effects of eutrophication of water bodies.",

Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate draught forces and soil movements when operating the new share. Materials and Methods: Experiments were conducted in a laboratory set-up using a soil bin with a fine loamy soil texture. The soil was compacted to a bulk density of 1500 kg m−3, with a penetration index of 486 kPa and a mean water content of 10%. The cultivation depths were 30, 50 and 70 mm and the operation speeds were 0.84, 1.67 and 2.31 m s−1. Cubes were used to measure soil movement by recording the displacement from their initial positions. The soil surface and furrow profile were measured by using a 2D laser range scanner. Results: The results showed that increasing operation speed and cultivation depths generally increased draught forces and soil movement. Changing the cultivation depth from 30 to 50 mm resulted in a 63% greater longitudinal force (Fx), and 71% greater Fx when increasing the cultivation depth from 50 to 70 mm. Conclusion: The study showed that the new L-share mounted on a modified spring tine only causes minor soil movement and thereby minimising the undesirable soil movement.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the effects of potassium doses (control, 150, 300 and 450 mg K2SO4 kg−1) and salt stress (control, 100 mM NaCl) on the yield and some element content of four medicinal and aromatic (Coriandrum sativum, Anethum graveolens, Ocimum basilicum and Foeniculum vulgare) plants were investigated in climate chamber. Both salinity and K fertiliser levels affected the fresh and dry weight of all evaluated plants. Anethum graveolens, Ocimum basilicum species are more sensitive to salinity, particularly at the vegetative productive stages. The highest fresh and dry weights of leaves, stems, roots and herb in Coriandrum sativum and Foeniculum vulgare species was observed in 300 mg kg−1 fertiliser applications. In general, there was a relatively consistent and positive correlation between root element content and aerial parts element content. The result of the present study showed that NaCl treatment caused an increase in Na+ concentration, and a decrease in K+ and Ca+2 concentration in Coriandrum sativum, Anethum graveolens, Ocimum basilicum and Foeniculum vulgare. There was an interaction between K2SO4 application and salinity effects on Na+ concentration in the all evaluated plants. Given the experimental results, especially Foeniculum vulgare and Coriandrum sativum species were the most resistant to salt stress.",

Is there a justification for this by explaining what relationship between the yield and individual yielding traits are formed in hybrid and population cultivars. During years 2012–2015 field studies to evaluate five hybrid and five population cultivars response on the standard and high-input technology in winter oilseed rape production have been executed in Poland. High-input technology included: double foliar application (in autumn, and in spring) of micro-nutrients, additional top fertilisation of 40 kg N per ha in spring, double application of the amino-acid bio-stimulators, and additional growth regulator. According to the principle component analysis made for both technologies it was found that hybrids and population cultivars displayed varied response which is explained here on the basis of morphological, growth, and yield elements. The high-input technology improved the yield responded elements e.g. number of siliques and number of seeds per silique as well as winter hardiness. This impact was more evident for population cultivars than for hybrids. We state that high-input technology, as the proposal in this paper, that provided 9.6% increase in seed yield, is biologically justified for winter oilseed rape crop and can be recommended in North and central European countries.",

    "abstract": "Selection for deep rooting is critical for the development of genotypes that are able to explore deep soil water and nutrients, particularly as agricultural resources become more limited. However, current root phenotyping techniques demand significant investments of time, money, and effort, and measurements on very young plants or plants grown under soilless culture. This study introduced four novel and simple techniques for fast evaluation of root depth in tube rhizotrons, which enable root observation around the transparent tube walls, and allow roots growing to natural size in semi-field conditions. The first and second innovations involve the introduction of 15N tracer and herbicide to the roots, which estimated root activity by measuring the responses of the shoots aboveground. The third involves placement of a cone deep in the rhizotron, to increase chances to observe more deep roots along the tube walls. The fourth involves measurement of roots that emerge from the rhizotron bottom. The reliability of these techniques were assessed in a series of five experiments during 2014 and 2015. These tests compared two pairs of genotypes that previous studies had shown to have mutually distinctive root traits: the spring wheat pair of ‘April bearded’ vs. ‘Dacke’; and the winter wheat pair of ‘Tabasco’ vs. ‘Genius’, with the first of each pair being the genotype known for deep rooting. Results showed that the new techniques were as good as or better than existing alternatives at accurately measuring root traits. In eight of the nine comparisons, the measurements were consistent with the expectations of root characteristics for these known genotypes. Importantly, the indirect root activity measures (herbicide and 15N) showed the same trend as the direct root observation techniques in all experiments, but higher ability to distinguish the genotypes and more promise for future upscaling for plant breeding.",

Nine bacterial isolates were selected according to their plant growth properties including soluble phosphate and potassium, ammonia, auxin and siderophore producing, ACC deaminase, and antagonistic pathogen as well. Changes in ginseng after PGPB inoculation were evaluated with respect to the non-inoculated control.Results and Conclusions: The PGPB isolates were identified as genera Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, Rhizobium, Stenotrophomonas, Erwinia, Ochrobactrum, Enterobacter and Pantoea based on 16S rRNA sequences. Inoculation of G209 and G119 increased not only plant height, root length, fresh weight, and dry weight, but also root activity and the amount of ginsenosides significantly. In particular, using the Illumina Miseq platform, the native bacterial community of rhizospheric soil maintained high community diversity and increased abundance of specific bacteria. Therefore, they may be play a crucial role in sustainable ginseng cultivating in farmland.",

These mixtures, 20% D1 or D2 + 80% C or P (v/v), were evaluated as growth media for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Results and conclusion: The growth media were all physically stable during the growing period, provided all the macronutrients and most of the micronutrients necessary for plant growth, adequate pH conditions, as well as an adequate electrical conductivity. The mixture of D2 and P produced the highest biomass compared to a mineral fertilised peat (control), with a biomass production of 76% of the control for lettuce and 54% for tomato. Causes for the biomass reduction relative to the control may be related to ammonium toxicity effects, and/or limited plant-available water. The digestates, particularly D1, seemed also to have a phytotoxic effect on the germination.",

It can be overwhelmed by apical bud defoliation, allowing numerous lateral buds to develop into more lateral branches carrying more fruits and possibly increasing seed yield. This study tested this hypothesis on five hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) cultivars in a 2-year field experiment. In comparison to the intact ones, the defoliated plants developed several lateral shoots. The hemp seed yield was significantly influenced by the year of production, the apical bud removal, and the cultivar. The average two-year seed yield of the defoliated plants (715 ± 47 kg/ha) was significantly higher than the yield of the intact plants (568 ± 35 kg/ha). Absolutely the greatest effect of apical bud removal on the seed yield was observed for the cultivar 'Novosadska konoplja', where increase was 225 kg/ha (25%); a slightly smaller difference occurred for the cultivar 'Uniko-B' (183 kg; 30%), followed by 'Juso-11' (140 kg/ha; 27%) and 'Bialobrzeskie' (128 kg/ha; 29). Cultivar 'Beniko' presented the smallest difference with apical bud removal – 58 kg/ha (15%) yield increase We maintain that hemp producers can achieve a larger seed yield not only by selecting an appropriate cultivar and row distance but also by removing apical buds.",

The varieties evaluated were: Bauska, Favel, Fuego, Gloria, Jõgeva, Lielplatones, Priekulu and Priekulu viettejas. The highest and most stable average yield for 2015–2016 years was recorded in Bauska and Priekulu, with 3.77 and 3.64 t/ha, respectively. The incidence of chocolate spot and rust was in low to middling.

From these yield and phenotype characteristics results we conclude that Lielplatones is the most suitable faba bean var. minor varieties for breeding in Northern European conditions, because of the following characteristics: middle yielding, quite high content of protein, very small seeds, low susceptibility to chocolate spot, good resistance to lodging. Thus almost every tested variety had some very good characteristics, which may also be valuable for the breeding of new varieties.",

This research aimed to study whether strip-till and conventional tillage (post-harvest ripping and mixing of stubble, ploughing, pre-sowing fertilisation, and seedbed preparation) differ in plant density, yield components, and grain yield of winter barley cultivated on Cambisol in a region with low rainfall, the annual average is about 500 mm. To reach this aim, a two-year, large-plot experiment was conducted in a production field. The soil within the field was spatially variable in texture, moisture, and chemical and biological properties, CV 2.3% do 29.6%. Strip-till had lower within-field spatial variability of winter barley grain yield than conventional tillage. The standard deviation was 0.36 t ha−1, 0.67 t ha−1 in the first year and 0.12 t ha−1, 0.30 t ha−1 in the second year, respectively. During the period of limited rainfall, strip-till had greater uniformity of plants after emergence; after the winter with low air temperature and a low amount of snow, it had greater plant density. Thus, strip-till can reduce variability of plants and their yield within a field, especially in adverse environmental conditions.",

To evaluate maize (Zea mays L.) yield under short-time conservation management with incorporation and/or importation of different residue levels, a biannual rotation experiment was conducted in ash volcanic soil in south-central Chile. The experiment consisted of two previous crops, canola (Brassica napus L.) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and four levels of residue incorporation (0%, 50%, 100%, and 200% of generated residue; from 0 to 21.4 Mg ha−1 for canola and from 0 to 19.0 Mg ha−1 for bean). Previous crop species and residue level affected some nutrients concentrations in grain and plant and some soil chemical properties, without effect in maize yield, which averaged 16.6 Mg ha−1. Bean residue increased Ca and reduced S in maize plant, increasing soil P, Ca, Mg and K (P < 0.05). Maize grain Ca content was positively and proportionally affected by canola residue level and negatively and proportionally affected by bean residue level. All canola residue levels increased soil pH and Mg, but the highest level reduced soil S; soil P concentration increased proportionally with bean residue level. The highest bean residue level increased soil S. Different crop and levels of residue did not affect maize yield but did some plant nutrient concentration, and also affected some soil chemical properties.",

A developed software-based algorithm for controlling the drying process of cereal grain under variable heat supply became a basis for designing a grain dryer changing the grain layer height from compartment to compartment.

It is imperative to develop drought-tolerant wheat varieties with high yield potential and enhanced grain protein content for food security. Silicon (Si) is important for plant growth and development but its role in abiotic stress tolerance has been overlooked in breeding programs. Identifying the underlying functional genes controlling drought tolerance, protein content and grain yield is essential for wheat improvement, especially under drought stress. Silicon uptake is conditioned by several Si transporter genes such as Lsi1, Lsi2 and Lsi6 and aquaporins, which facilitate transport of silicon and water between cells. The objectives of this review are to examine the role of Si in improving plant nutrition and drought tolerance, and to appraise the genetic control of Si uptake and breeding methods for improving Si uptake for drought adaptation and improved grain yield and quality. The review highlights the limited progress made in breeding for drought tolerance in wheat, especially in sub-Sahara Africa where the challenge is prevalent. Limited understanding of the genetic basis for Si uptake and physiology contribute to the limited progress in its exploitation in wheat improvement programs.",

    "abstract": "Studies that provide representative insights for determining yield through its related traits during the ontogeny of modern cultivars subjected to sources of environmental variation are limited for different crops, including wheat. Most of the empirical evidence on the relationships between the yield of small grain cereal crops and its contributing traits has been obtained under dry or semidry conditions. The aims of this paper were to (1) illustrate how an path analysis can be used to clarify and interpret the relationships between grain yield (GY), yield components, and other yield-related traits of 25 winter wheat cultivars subjected to sources of environmental variation and (2) determine how the yield-related traits contribute to the yield variation. The data used in this analysis were generated from multi-environment trials across wheat-growing areas in Poland. Using Ward's clustering procedure was capable of identifying the most critical predictor traits of the yield components and their contributions to cultivar-focused GY variation. Our findings document, confirm, and improve the basic biological understanding of how to grow modern wheat cultivars for high GY through effectively stimulating the improvement of yield-related traits through the optimization of developmental stage-based agronomic strategies. Our results confirmed empirically that modern European wheat cultivars grown in a temperate climate require favorable conditions, the use of appropriate N fertilizer and growth regulators, and the application of fungicide to protect against leaf diseases and to provide conditions that effectively increase the time to anthesis, the Leaf Area Index per spike at anthesis, and the grain filling duration, and reduce plant height and flag leaf disease severity, thus leading to a high GY. A high yield level is obtained by the performance of preferred yield-related traits that can maintain the three yield components at relatively high levels.",

    "abstract": "Potassium (K) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Plant growth and development can be seriously affected by K deficiency. However, plants with different K efficiencies behave differently. It is still not fully understood how plants with higher K efficiency could maintain better growth in a low K environment and what is the relationship between K recycling and photosynthesis metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the difference in K re-translocation and photosynthesis transportation can explain genotype differences in K efficiency between K-efficient genotype 103 and K-inefficient genotype 122. Results of this study showed that the dry matter accumulation of genotype 122 decreased much more than that of genotype 103 affected by K deficiency environment. Root growth of the two genotypes was inhibited by K deficiency, but genotype 122 was affected more than genotype 103. Using the K utilization index as an evaluation factor for K efficiency, it was found that genotype 103 was significantly higher than genotype 122. Potassium affected the K distribution in plants for both the genotypes. Potassium was distributed more to the stem and leafstalk in a normal K environment whereas it was more to the leaf and root in a low K environment, especially for genotype 103. Potassium also affected photosynthetic products' distribution. The leaf of genotype 122 accumulated most of its photosynthetic product while genotype 103 had better ability to transport it into the root to maintain better growth under a K-deficient environment. Results of this study indicated that more K recycling into the root and more efficient transport of the photosynthetic product into the root contribute to better root growth and therefore increased tolerance to K deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Full exploitation of the potential of new varieties requires research, whose aim is to adapt the technology to their needs. A two-factor experiment evaluated the effect of row spacing (33, 44, and 55 cm) of three oilseed rape (OSR) varieties (conventional, hybrid, and \"semi-dwarf\" hybrid variety) on canopy area index (CAI) and yield components. At higher row spacing, OSR plants were characterized by a strong increase in the CAI at successive growth stages; thereby, the incomplete use of production area was compensated at the pod development stage. The differences in the CAI between row spacings were significant until the end of flowering, whereas differences in the CAI between varieties were significant until the flower bud development stage. In the next development phases, CAI of OSR plants was at a similar level to all plots. However, the statistical analysis showed a declining trend in seed yield and yield biomass (pods and straw weight) with increasing row spacing. A positive aspect of increased row spacing was a decrease in glucosinolates content in seeds. The differences in fat content were statistically insignificant. The hybrid varieties of OSR produced the highest seed yield at a row spacing of 33 cm, while the conventional – at a row spacing of 44 cm. These relationships are confirmed by high positive correlations of seed weight and pod weight per unit area with CAI. The results have important practical aspect, because it shows that it is possible to reduce the number of OSR plants per unit area, thereby reducing demand for expensive certified seeds for sowing but to certain limits. Too small plant density binds to the risk of decreased seed yield. It may be justified, e.g., in extensive or organic farming where wide row creates the possibility of mechanical weed control.",

However, the southern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita, Kofoid & White, Chitwood) and its biological races constitute serious limitation to successful introduction of alternative crops with economic attributes, particularly when the target plants have limited degree of nematode resistance. A pot trial was therefore conducted to determine the degree of nematode resistance in M. balsamina seedlings to M. incognita race 2. Seedlings were inoculated at seven levels of M. incognita race 2, which were laid out in a randomised complete block design, with 12 replications. After three nematode generations, the mean reproductive factor (RF = Pf/Pi) values at all levels of inoculation were less than unity, while nematode infection had no effect on growth of M. balsamina seedlings, which suggested that this plant was resistant to the test nematode. In conclusion, due to its resistance to M. incognita race 2, M. balsamina could serve as an alternative crop for use as vegetable, ethnomedicinal and/or neutraceutical plant in rural communities with high populations of M. incognita race 2.",

Economically, optimal fertilization may imply higher N application than the amount of N removed in grain, thereby causing high risk for N losses. The aims of this paper were to study the fertilization practice for cereals and the relationship between N application and yield, N balance, and N use efficiency for barley and oats in three of the catchments included in the Norwegian Agricultural Monitoring Programme (JOVA). The results showed that the average amount of applied N to cereals in these three catchments was higher, and sometimes considerably so, than the recommended N application. Within the range of N application in these catchments, there was no relationship between N application and yield for oats, whereas a tendency of increased yield with increased N application was found for barley in two of the catchments. The average N surplus in cereal production was significantly higher than that expected if fertilization recommendations had been followed. The average N surplus for the different cereals varied from 36 to 60 kg N ha−1 in two of the catchments and from 22 to 40 kg N ha−1 in the third catchment. The average N use efficiency (calculated as N removed in grain divided by the amount of applied N) ranged from 61 to 71% for barley and from 67 to 82% for oat. The JOVA data clearly demonstrate the importance of using moderate N applications in order to reduce N surplus, and thereby reduce N losses. N application for higher yield levels than those normally obtained, results in low N use efficiency and high N surplus in most years.",

Bacterivores were the most dominant trophic group in all three systems with a mean proportion of over 80%, followed by omnivore-carnivores. In general, organic management practices increased the abundance of total nematodes, bacterivores, fungivores, and omnivore-carnivores in comparison with low input and conventional management practices. Though inhibitory effects of plant feeders were found in organic and low input systems, these effects were more evident in organic systems. However, small differences were observed in the composition of trophic groups and fauna analysis. All three systems displayed enriched soil conditions and structured food webs. We inferred that the bottom-up effect resulting from organic input in the soil food web may play a more important role than the disruption effects under our high input greenhouse conditions. The Shannon index (H′) and genus dominance (λ) suggested that in greenhouse conditions, excessive manure input would cause a decrease in nematode diversity but increase the dominance, particularly for enrichment opportunists. We concluded that management practices under greenhouse conditions were more influential on nematode biomass (including trophic groups) than community structure.",

For this purpose a pot experiment was conducted combining three eroded soils (lightly, moderately, severely) and four soil water levels (relative to field capacity of 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%) using nondisturbed Luvic Phaeozem soil from field by electric drill. The results showed that the response of soybean root growth to soil water was different for the three eroded soils and varied with growth stages of the plant. Under an optimal water supply, roots grew best in moderately eroded soils. Response of soybean root growth to water stress degree was similar under deficit water situation for three eroded soils, and under excess water stress situation, the root growth of lightly eroded soils was restricted more seriously than that of moderately and severely eroded soils during the initial branching stage. Root growth was restricted only seriously to the lack of water conditions for moderately and severely eroded soils; however, root growth of lightly eroded soils was restricted still seriously to both excess and a lack of water supply, and root growth of lightly eroded soils was restricted more seriously to water stress than that of moderately and severely eroded soils from the branching to maturing stages. The root distributions with depths were not different among three eroded soils under optimal water supply, but root growth of lightly eroded soils was restricted more seriously to water stress than moderately and severely eroded soils for three soil layers, and water stress degree of root weight increased with depths. The study results could provide theoretical basis of improving land productivity for different eroded soils.",

    "abstract": "Chile's seedling production industry has been growing for the last 10 years, and demand has actually reached 1250 million seedlings per year. This system has special relevance due to the high cost of seeds. In addition, there is an increasing demand for substituting synthetic agrochemicals. Therefore, the potential use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in tomato production has been investigated. Before sowing, the micro-organisms provided by Biogram S.A. were inoculated into the substrate diluted in 250 mL/L unchlorinated water. The experiment was laid out in a ‘split-plot’ design with the two plant substrates as main plots and the inoculants as subplots, including six replicates per treatment. Tomato seedlings were grown using two different plant substrates: a mixture of 70% peat and 30% perlite by volume, and a substrate with 20% peat, 20% perlite and 60% compost by volume, both inoculated with Bacillus subtilis or Pseudomonas fluorescens or Bioroot®, which is a commercial product containing B. subtilis, P. fluorescens, Trichoderma harzianum, yeast, algae and Nocardia. For control, uninoculated tomato seedlings were grown on the respective plant substrates. Variance analysis did not identify significant interactions between substrate type (main plots) and inoculation treatment (subplots), P ≤ 0.05. There were significant differences between inoculants (P ≤ 0.05). Means were compared by using the Tukey's multiple range test. Tomato growth in terms of leaf area (cm2/plant) and shoot and root dry weight (g/10 plants) was improved for the seedlings grown on the substrate with 70% peat and 30% perlite, compared to the compost containing an alternative that is valid for both uninoculated perlite peat and all inoculated treatments where perlite peat was outstanding. Inoculation with Bioroot® improved the leaf area, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, radical contact area, volume of roots and root forks compared with the control without inoculation, when both plant substrates were analysed together. Thus, inoculation with Bioroot® can be recommended as an alternative to tomato seedling growers' dependence on synthetic agrochemicals.",

    "abstract": "Secondary drainage impact of groundwater outflow can affect drainage design and form a pathway for nutrient loading in agricultural areas. Holistic assessment of water balance and all outflow pathways can benefit design of sustainable drainage in a changing climate. In this study, three-dimensional, hydrological FLUSH model was applied to investigate a field-scale data set and to produce a closure of water balance throughout all seasons in a clayey subsurface drained agricultural field in high-latitude conditions. Description of evapotranspiration (ET)-groundwater interactions using a three-dimensional hydrological model provides a new approach for evaluating standard computational methods to estimate ET with limited crop data. Different ET estimates were tested in the context of total water balance, and the coupling of ET and groundwater outflow was assessed. Comparison of measured and simulated water balance components demonstrated that reference ET (Penman–Monteith method) overestimated ET in the cropped field in high latitude conditions. The FAO-56 single crop coefficient approach was also noted to overestimate ET in the studied conditions. A calibrated constant crop coefficient satisfactorily described ET in spring and in autumn, but underestimated it during summer periods. The results suggest that care should be taken when applying standard methods in high-latitude conditions. Groundwater outflow and ET were shown to be interlinked, but even a relatively high potential ET affected the amount of groundwater outflow only slightly. The results demonstrate that groundwater outflow can form an important component of the water balance in clayey subsurface drained fields. The strength of the 3D model was demonstrated in showing how ET had an impact on all outflow components of drained field sections. Such a modelling tool is useful for generating scenarios that show how changes in climate forcing and thereby ET can alter the partitioning of the field-scale water balance.",

    "abstract": "An open question with regard to the community ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) concerns how to best amplify AMF in the soil, which contains a large proportion of DNA from AM extra-radical mycelium and spores. However, to date, a direct comparison of AMF primers for soil samples, which would systematically assess their amplification efficiency, is still missing. In our present study, we compared and characterized four widely used primer sets targeting AMF 18S rDNA or SSU-ITS-LSU rDNA from three soil samples as follows: (1) SSUmAf/LSUmAr + SSUmCf/LSUmBr, (2) GeoA2/Geo11 + NS31/AM1, (3) AML1/AML2 + NS31/AM1 and (4) AMV4.5NF/AMDGR. These primer sets were compared in terms of the proportion of Glomeromycota detected, AMF diversity and community composition. Our data revealed that the newly combined primer set 3 was the most suitable one for amplifying AMF from soil samples. It yielded the highest AMF alpha diversity, and was very specific to Glomeromycota. Primer set 2 was unable to amplify Claroideoglomus from soil 1, which was the dominant AMF clade as proved by other three primer sets. Primer set 4 demonstrated its instability among different soil samples, since the proportion of AMF in total sequences varied from 5% to 83%. Although primer set 1 showed the highest proportion of AMF (95–100%) in the soil samples, it captured the lowest AMF diversity, and the operational taxonomic units obtained by this primer set were only 36.4% of that by primer set 4. Taken together, our data suggested that AMF diversity in soil samples could be underestimated by primer set 1, 2 and 4. Our result confirmed the important role of the choice of AMF primers for analyzing AMF communities in soil and explored the most suitable one for amplifying AMF from soil samples.",

There is limited research identifying the most important factors affecting wheat yield and assessing their relative importance in the long run. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of fertilisation, precipitation and variety to wheat yield using a long-term field experiment (1984–2014) on the semiarid Loess Plateau in China. The experiment consisted of six treatments: fertilisation with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), manure (M), NP, NPM, and a control without fertilisation. We monitored the yield of three varieties of winter wheat over time and assessed the changes in grain yield, soil properties, fertiliser-contribution rate (FCR) and precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) with different fertilisation treatments and precipitation patterns. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to identify the most important factors affecting wheat yield and examine their relative importance. The results showed that fallow-season precipitation and annual precipitation (AnP) positively correlated with wheat yield in the N, M, NP, and NPM treatments. The amount of fertilisation, AnP, and monthly precipitation of February and September were included in the linear regression model; however, the influence of variety on yield could be ignored. With 30 years of fertilisation, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and available potassium levels with NPM was higher than the control by 70.6%, 70.5%, and 319.2%, respectively. Yield, FCR, and PUE with M increased annually at rates of 89 kg ha−1 y−1, 1.47 kg kg−1 y−1, and 0.13 kg mm−1 y−1, respectively. The yields and FCR, but not PUE, of all fertilised treatments were higher in wet than normal and dry years. The FCR with P was negative in all the three precipitation patterns. This study has implications for maximising the long-term winter yield with various factors in the rain-fed winter wheat cropping system of the Loess Plateau.",

Early-maturing cultivars were characterized by early initiation of floral primordia and early flowering and fruit maturation. High temperatures in July and early August delayed floral initiation in the early cultivars, resulting in more synchronous initiation of early and late cultivars. The recent Norwegian cultivar 'Nobel', which has an everbearing parent, differed from the other cultivars by early initiation also at elevated summer temperature. Inadequate yield and berry size were identified as important causes for outdating of older cultivars, such as 'Senga Sengana' and 'Glima'. Overall, the high-yielding and large-fruited 'Sonata' was judged as the best fresh consumption cultivar in Norway, and market trends indicate that it will continue to expand its market share at the expense of 'Korona', mainly because of inadequate fruit firmness and shelf life of the latter. Adequate yields and berry quality justify the use of the late maturing 'Florence' for prolongation of the fresh market season. The results are discussed together with practical experiences and market preferences in an attempt to provide overall cultivar recommendations for Norway.",

ANOVA and AMMI showed significant genotype, environment and GEI effects. High grain yield was recorded for genotypes G35 (0.47 t ha−1), G1 (0.45 t ha−1) and G47 (0.43 t ha−1) across test environments. AMMI stability values (ASV); identified Acc-Cowp44 as the most stable genotype across all sites, recording the lowest ASV of 0.03. The comparison view of GGE biplot revealed Acc-Cowp29, Acc-Cowp38 and Acc-Cowp5 as ideal genotypes, possessing high grain yield of 0.19, 0.47 and 0.36 t ha−1, respectively. The identified genotypes are recommended for production and inclusion in subsequent breeding activities.",

This study tested the impact of integrating a combination of OMM practices on soil fertility, biomass, and nutrient recycling on smallholder farms. Following a randomised complete block design, a four-season experiment was conducted in 2018-2019 on 10 farms. The treatments (T) included T1: cowpea-maize-bean-maize rotation; T2: cowpea-maize-bean-maize rotation + farmyard manure; T3: Faidherbia albida alleys + cowpea-maize-bean-maize rotation; T4: F. albida alleys + cowpea-maize-bean-maize rotation + farmyard manure; and T5 (control): maize monocrop with diammonium phosphate application at 50 kg/ha application rate. T1-T4 are the OMM practices. The maize in T2-T4 was undersown with Mucuna pruriens. Soil fertility parameters (i.e. pH, water holding capacity, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), biomass, and nutrients in the biomass were determined. There were no differences in soil fertility parameters among all treatments (P > 0.05). From the second to the fourth season, biomass was consistently higher under T3 and T4 than in other treatments. Moreover, the nutrients in biomass were higher in T3 and T4 than in other treatments, an indicator that OMM practices with alley crops can increase nutrient recycling.",

While local farmers use organic resources in some way, the adoption of organic agriculture as a means of commercial production is lagging. Peer-reviewed literature on organic agriculture in Zimbabwe and most of Africa is limited. This review identifies regional situational differences in the farming environment in sub-Sahara Africa and Zimbabwe and discusses the opportunities and challenges peculiar to smallholder organic agriculture farmers. Results show that organic agriculture in Zimbabwean smallholder farming areas is mainly promoted by non-governmental organisations and supporting public policy is lacking. Local markets for organic produce are not well developed and an opportunity exists to develop local markets through supportive public policies, private sector engagement and further training and farmer support. While most soils present challenges to crop production due to nutrient deficiencies, yield increases are possible with organic management and research on mixing/fortifying organic amendments is needed.",

Various studies have shown better phosphorus (P) availability with adding biochar. However, limited reporting is available on absorption–desorption behaviour of added P and dose optimisation of biochar. Rice straw biochar (RSB) and acacia biochar (ACB), prepared by slow pyrolysis at optimised temperature and pyrolysis time, were incubated at different rates (0, 5, and 10 g kg−1) in loamy sand and clay loam soils to study P sorption compared to the unamended control. The data was observed to be best fitted into Langmuir adsorption isotherm for P adsorption. The effects on maximum P adsorption, bonding energy, and adsorption rate constants were lower in loamy sand compared to clay loam soil. The values of maximum P desorption (Dm) and desorption rate constant (Kd) decreased with the application of biochar. A linear regression equation optimised the amount of P addition for soil amendments. For the soil with inherent P content, rice biochar was the best option (5 g kg−1), while for soils lacking in P, ACB is optimised at 5 g kg−1 with external P input of 1 mg P kg−1 of test soil. This data can be recommended to the farmers as a best practice for the P addition, along with managing farm wastes as biochars to enhance nutrient availability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To examine the possibilities of reducing fertilizer levels and losses of nitrogen, we studied the effects of amount and timing of nitrogen fertilization on growth parameters and on soil nitrogen depletion in cauliflower. A higher nitrogen supply, calculated as the sum of fertilizer nitrogen and mineral nitrogen at transplanting, resulted in a clear increase in nitrogen uptake by the crop and in a higher crop fresh weight. However, curd fresh or dry weight and looseness of the curd were not affected. Therefore we conclude that total nitrogen supply can be reduced to approximately 250 kg ha−1 without negative effects on yield. An increase in nitrogen supply of 100 kg ha−1 resulted in 17 kg ha−1 more residual soil nitrogen, 52 kg ha−1 more nitrogen in crop residues, 37 kg ha−1 more mineralizable N and 15 kg ha−1 more nitrogen in harvested curds. Changing the timing of nitrogen application, by reducing the application at planting and increasing the second application instead, resulted in a higher curd biomass, a larger amount of nitrogen in the curd and less residual soil nitrogen after harvest. Thus, the efficiency of nitrogen use was increased when more nitrogen was supplied at the time of a higher absolute growth and nitrogen demand.

However, before using the recycled material in agricultural and horticultural production it is necessary to make sure that the material does not contain any unwanted contaminants. In general, there is a lack of knowledge about organic contaminants in the degradable fraction of household waste and its compost and anaerobic digestion products. As a first step in a study of organic contaminants in household waste, and as part of the characterization of the degradation processes during composting and anaerobic digestion, the major extractable organic compounds were identified in the biologically degradable fraction of fresh, composted and anaerobically digested household waste. The organic compounds were isolated by supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide as extraction medium. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for qualitative analyses. Natural products, such as fatty acids, fatty acid esters, n-alkanes, aliphatic alcohols, monoterpenes and triterpenes constituted the major organic components in the waste samples. In addition bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, frequently used as a plasticizer in polymers, was found in the extracts. In the chromatograms of the extracts of the fresh and composted household waste, fatty acids and fatty acid esters dominated with respect to peak heights and the number of peaks identified. In the anaerobically digested household waste n-alkanes were the dominating compound class. The pattern of the n-alkanes, also found in the fresh waste, possibly indicates a petrogenic origin of these compounds, perhaps caused by contamination during the collection of the household waste.",

Manganese deficient conditions induced elevated concentrations of Zn and Fe in shoots of both species. The corresponding antagonistic relationship between Mn and Cu could only be seen in barley. The observed antagonistic relationships were only valid as long as the plant growth was limited by Mn deficiency. The Mn concentration in both plant species increased significantly with increasing Mn2+ activity in the nutrient solution. The concentration of Mn in the shoots of oat was higher than for barley except under severe Mn deficiency where it was found equal for both species. Manganese was accumulated in the roots of barley at high Mn2+ activity. The different shoot concentrations of Mn between barley and oat are therefore attributed to the extent of Mn translocation from roots to shoots.

As many of the investigated clover-soil systems were of those previously known to be very low in Co and Mo, and the gain in N yield obtained by extra Co supply was marginal, it is unlikely that deficiency of these trace elements is a problem of great concern in legume based forage production systems in Norway.",

The need for primary induction varied from a predominantly SD requirement in Bromus inermis and Dactylis glomerata to a predominantly low temperature (vernalization) requirement in Lolium perenne and an almost pure low temperature requirement in Festuca pratensis. Although tillers emerging before or during primary induction had the highest chance of becoming reproductive in all species, up to 22%, 15% and 27% of the tillers emerging after termination of primary induction, and thus without direct exposure to SD, became reproductive in Bromus inermis, Dactylis glomerata and Lolium perenne, respectively. In an additional experiment with SD induction at 12°C, detillering during secondary induction increased the flowering capacity of non-directly exposed tillers from 17 to 41 in Bromus inermis. These results are discussed in the light of different hypotheses regarding control of flowering in temperate grasses.

No similar studies have been carried out on wetland peat soils. The objective was to compare extraction efficiency of ammonium lactate (P-AL), sodium bicarbonate (P-Olsen), and double calcium lactate (P-DCaL) and P distribution in the soil profile of wetland peat soils. For this purpose, 34 samples of the 0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm layers were collected from peat soils in Germany, Israel, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom and analysed for P. Mean soil pH (CaCl2, 0.01 M) was 5.84, 5.51 and 5.47 in the 0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm layers, respectively. The P-DCaL was consistently about half the magnitude of either P-AL or P-Olsen. The efficiency of P extraction increased in the order P-DCaL<P-AL≤P-Olsen, with corresponding means (mg kg−1) for all soils (34 samples) of 15.32, 33.49 and 34.27 in 0–30 cm; 8.87, 17.30 and 21.46 in 30–60 cm; and 5.69, 14.00 and 21.40 in 60–90 cm. The means decreased with depth. When examining soils for each country separately, P-Olsen was relatively evenly distributed in the German, UK and Slovenian soils. P-Olsen was linearly correlated (r=0.594, P=0.0002) with pH, whereas the three P tests (except P-Olsen vs P-DCaL) significantly correlated with each other (P=0.0178≤0.0001). The strongest correlation (r=0.617, P=0.0001) was recorded for P-AL vs P-DCaL) and the two methods were inter-convertible using a regression equation: P-AL=−22.593+5.353 pH+1.423 P-DCaL, R 2 =0.550.",

The soil was collected from 0–5 cm depth at a distance of 50 cm from coffee tree trunks. The total Cu concentration in the soil used was 250 mg kg−1. Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) were used as indicator crops and were grown in a greenhouse. The amendments used consisted of beringite, a modified aluminosilicate residue from coal mines, farmyard manure, banana compost, Albizia litter, and phosphate fertilizer. In general, the application of all amendments resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content and soil pH, which in consequence reduced both CaCl2-extractable Cu in soils and Cu concentration in both plant species. Beringite at all rates of application reduced the CaCl2-extractable Cu in soils and increased soil pH significantly, but the effect was most pronounced at an application rate of 5%. Similarly, the application of farmyard manure and banana compost at a rate of 10% significantly reduced the CaCl2-extractable Cu in soils. The increase in soil pH caused by the amendments was negatively correlated to both CaCl2-extractable Cu in soils and Cu concentration in plant tissue. However, the increasing concentration of CaCl2-extractable Cu in soils showed a positive correlation with Cu in plant tissue. Albizia litter at 10% incorporation rate significantly reduced the CaCl2-extractable Cu in soils. The application of P to maize reduced CaCl2-extractable Cu in soils, but the reduction in plant Cu was not significant. The results suggest that beringite, FYM and banana compost may be suitable amendments to reduce plant available Cu in soils and Cu uptake by plants, but their applicability and relative efficiency under field conditions need to be investigated.",

Until 1982, low inputs of N fertilizer (22 kg ha−1) were used. In 1983, they were brought into line with current farming practice. This paper presents the results of three subsequent rotations. Yields without any fertilizer were on average 48% of those with 100 kg N ha−1 in compound fertilizer, whilst those with 20, 40 and 60 Mg ha−1 farmyard manure were 81, 87 and 90%, respectively. Yields with other combinations of N, P and K declined in the order NP, NK, N, PK and K. When NPK fertilizer was used, apparent recoveries of applied fertilizer were close to 50% for N and K, and around 40% for P. Much lower values were found for nutrients applied singly. Balance between N supply and removal was indicated at rates of about 60 kg N fertilizer ha−1 in potatoes, 75 kg ha−1 in cereals and 90 kg ha−1 in leys. A surplus of P was found in all crops at all N levels, and of K in cereals and potatoes. In leys, K balance was achieved with an N supply of 90 kg N ha−1. Nutrient balance was indicated at a little below 20 Mg ha−1 yr−1 farmyard manure. Larger manure applications gave large nutrient surpluses, particularly of N. Soil reaction remained close to neutral with the use of calcium nitrate and manure, but declined with the use of ammonium nitrate. Manure use gave the highest amounts of available P, K and Mg in soil. Similar increases in total inorganic P were found with manure use as with fertilizer use, but amounts of organic P and total K were little affected.",

As these farms discharge pig slurry into the adjacent rivers flowing into the Baltic Sea, there is a potential risk for pollution of both the rivers and the sea. This risk was assessed at the Vostochnii pig complex, which holds 60,000 pigs. The impact of slurry treatment on water quality in the groundwater (GW) and the river Igolinka, the recipient of the treated slurry, was investigated. The results indicated that untreated and treated slurry from pig farm wastewater treatment systems are potential point sources of environmental pollution. Generally, the GW was characterized by rather high contents of ammonium and chemical and biological demand for oxygen (COD, BOD). Similarly, the river exhibited high COD and BOD, contained considerable amounts of suspended substances and total P, and small quantities of NO3-N and NH4-N. Of the biological parameters investigated, the elevated population of fungi and pathogenic faecal bacteria Escherichia coli (100–10,000 CFU E. coli cells ml−1) determined in the river posed a potential health risk. Equally important was the marked total P load in the river, part of which could be transported to the Baltic Sea, where it could trigger eutrophication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A major obstacle to patch spraying of broad-leaved weeds in cereals is a cost-effective method to assess within-field heterogeneity of the weed population. One method could be a camera mounted in front of the spraying vehicle, online image analysis, and field sprayer shifting between 'on' and 'off' as the predefined weed damage threshold level is reached. Because such a camera will capture a very limited area (<1 m2) compared to the sprayer width (several m), success of this method requires that spraying decisions vary little within boom width, thereby causing few spraying errors. This approach was evaluated by simulations for varying boom widths and three levels of a weed damage threshold model. Potential herbicide reductions compared to blanket application were also simulated. The average potential herbicide reductions estimated as proportions of fields below the threshold, were 60%, 64% and 53% for the original, 25% increased and 25% reduced threshold levels, respectively. The simulated herbicide reductions were not influenced by boom width, but varied significantly between fields, and between threshold levels. As evaluated by spraying errors, the suitability of the suggested approach will increase by decreasing boom width, vary between fields, and in some fields vary between the threshold levels. For boom widths of 15 m and 24 m, the spraying errors were about 10% and 15%, respectively, where omission of spraying areas above the threshold constituted 5% and 8%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen fixation was simulated for a leafless variety (Delta) of pea (Pisum sativum L.) in central Sweden. It is assumed that N2 fixation is basically proportional to root biomass, but limited by high root N or low substrate carbon concentrations. Input data on root carbon and nitrogen were estimated from observations of above-ground biomass and nitrogen. The simulated N2 fixation was compared with estimated values from observations using the 15N labelling technique. Test data were taken from pea monocultures and pea-oat mixtures with varying pea biomass levels during 1999. Simulated within-season accumulated N2 fixation correlated to the estimated N2 fixation with a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.74. For seasonal simulations, the predictability was higher (R 2=0.93). Two alternative non-dynamic models, estimating seasonal N2 fixation as proportional to above-ground biomass and above-ground N, respectively, gave lower predictability (R 2=0.83 and 0.80, respectively). The models were also applied to a second year (1998) and two other sites by comparison with accumulated N2 fixation estimated by the Difference method. A halved specific N2 fixation rate (expressed per unit of root biomass) in 1999, compared with 1998, corresponded to essentially dryer and warmer soil conditions during 1999. It was indicated that the variations in soil moisture were more important than soil temperature. It was concluded that the abiotic responses might be of great importance for modelling N2 fixation rate under different soil conditions.",

In all crops receiving fertilizer, rapid uptake of N started about three weeks after planting. The relative yield of broccoli heads increased with increasing soil available N (fertilizer N plus Nmin) at planting to 200–250 kg N ha−1 and then levelled off. The two lower fertilizer rates were more restrictive to yields in early-planted than in late-planted crops. A general increase in harvest index with increasing N rate reflected a stronger effect of N on the head yield than on the total above ground biomass production. The apparent recovery of fertilizer N decreased with increasing N rate and was on average 74% in total above ground biomass and 25% in broccoli heads. Despite a higher N uptake, the average soil mineral N level at harvest increased from 12 kg N ha−1 on unfertilized plots to 27 and 78 kg N ha−1 on plots receiving 120 and 240 kg N ha−1, respectively; this increase was stronger in early than in late plantings and stronger in 'Milady' than in 'Marathon'. The yield of broccoli heads was similar in the two cultivars, but 'Milady' had a lower total biomass production and thus a higher harvest index, presumably due to earlier head initiation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Results for 1998–2004 are reported from four long-term (25–28 years) tillage trials, comparing conventional autumn ploughing with reduced tillage, normally spring harrowing only. Plant residues were retained during the period studied. The weather was somewhat wetter than the 1961–1990 normal. Results with reduced tillage were mostly similar to those seen in earlier trial periods. In Trial 1, mean grain yield was 95% with spring harrowing only versus autumn ploughing, 96% when harrowing in autumn was performed as well and 97% when the soil was ploughed every third year. In Trial 2 positive crop rotation effects were found both with and without ploughing, and reduced tillage gave 5% lower grain yield also in this trial. In Trial 3, tillage system did not affect yields of cereals grown in rotation with potatoes, but reduced tillage gave 12% lower potato yield than ploughing. Little difference in response to N fertilizer was found. In Trial 4, reduced tillage on large-scale (0.7 ha) plots gave 11% lower grain yields than annual ploughing, partly due to shallow sowing depth. No long-term trend in yield responses to tillage was discernible in any trial, and between-year variability was similar with both ploughing and reduced tillage. Percentage yields with reduced tillage relative to annual ploughing correlated positively with rainfall in May and with mean air temperature in August. It is concluded that the reduced tillage systems studied are sustainable in terms of productivity, relative to labour, machinery and energy inputs. Likely benefits of such systems include higher levels of organic matter and aggregate stability in surface soil horizons, but a disadvantage is the need for frequent herbicide use to control perennial weeds.",

The influence of regular fertilization with different NPK fertilizers in a crop rotation (winter wheat, sugar beet, spring barley, annual grasses and perennial grasses) and climatic conditions on the amount of N-compounds in lysimeter water (sampled at 40- and 80-cm depths) was investigated. Nitrate () concentration in lysimeter water depended mainly on the nitrate fertilizers application rate. Based on the 30-year mean (1976–2005), fertilization of agricultural crops with 112 kg N ha−1 increased nitrate concentration in lysimeter water at 40-cm depth by 67.1 mg l−1 to 112.1 mg l−1. An N-fertilization rate of 224 kg N ha−1 increased nitrate concentrations by 139.1 mg l−1 to 187.2 mg l−1. The effect of mineral fertilizers on ammonium () concentrations in lysimeter water was insignificant. Increases in the nitrogen concentration in lysimeter water in response to N-fertilization were more substantial when agricultural crops were not fertilized with phosphorus. Correlation between the nitrate concentration and applied amount of N-fertilizers was more statistically reliable when grain crops (r=0.65–0.67, n=74, p<0.001), sugar beet (r=0.63, n=27, p<0.001) and perennial grasses (r=0.40, n=59, p<0.01) were cultivated on the experimental field. Higher amounts of nitrate were leached when annual plants were cultivated, compared with perennial grasses. The concentration of NH4 and NO2 in lysimeter water was minimal and the influence of mineral fertilizers negligible.",

Our objectives were 1) to assess the tolerance of 13 selections of annual meadowgrass to simulated ice encasement (SIE) and pink snow mould (PSM, Microdochium nivale); 2) to determine if these tolerances were interrelated or related to plant concentrations of water soluble carbohydrates (WSC); and 3) to determine if tolerance to SIE can be associated with accumulation of toxic substances. Samples of the annual meadowgrass selections were taken from an experimental green at University Park, Pennsylvania, on four dates from 23 Nov. 2005 until 27 Mar. 2006. Samples of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) ‘Penn A-4’ were included for comparison in studies on SIE and WSC. Samples were vacuum-sealed in plastic bags at 1°C for SIE and inoculated with three isolates of M. nivale for PSM tolerance. Small, but significant, differences were found among annual meadowgrass selections after 23 days of SIE, but all selections were dead after 33 days. Significant differences were detected in foliar blighting after inoculation with M. nivale, regrowth relative to uninoculated control being three times higher in the most tolerant than in the most susceptible selections. In late November, two annual meadowgrass selections contained significantly more WSC than did creeping bentgrass, but this was not correlated with tolerance to SIE or PSM, which were also not interrelated. A separate experiment with increasing duration of SIE to one of the annual meadowgrass selections and ‘Penn A-4’ showed that the critical exposure periods were 25–30 and 42–47 days, respectively. The concentrations of the phytotoxic compounds butan-l-ol and ethyl butyrate were two- to three-times higher in annual meadowgrass than in creeping bentgrass.",

The results showed that Fe concentration in polished rice could be enriched with foliar Fe(II)-amino acids [the main formulation was the complex of 0.1% (w/v) FeSO4 •7H2O and 0.4% (w/v) compound amino acids, 18.6% N] application. Compared with the control, Fe concentration increased significantly, by 88.0%. Meanwhile, the positive effects on Zn concentration and protein and amino acid content improvement were found with boric acid (H3BO3, B) added to Fe(II)-amino acids foliar application. In detail, Zn concentration significantly increased (19.6%), and protein and lysine were increased significantly by 30.1 and 35.1%, respectively. Also the cooking and eating qualities were improved with foliar Fe(II)-amino acids and B compound spray.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monitoring clay dispersion in tillage-managed soils is important to avoid its negative impact on the soil. We studied clay dispersion in tilled (T) and untilled (NT) managed systems in five different soils from five locations. The aim was to compare the water-dispersible clay (WDC) generated with the T and NT practices and relate them to the measured soil properties. Soil samples were collected from 0–20 cm depth from T and NT of each location for analyses. The soils are acid and low in soil organic carbon (SOC), CEC and cations. WDC varied from 50 to 130 g kg−1 in the soils. In all the locations except one, WDC was higher in T than NT, while higher dispersion ratio (DR) was obtained in T for three out of the five soils. The potential shrink-swell hazard of the soils was in the moderate to severe classes, while two of the soils were in the very severe shrink-swell potential class. WDC correlated significantly with exchangeable acidity and pH (r=0.77*; −0.60*), respectively. Also the DR had a negative relationship with the Ca/Mg ratio (r=−0.60*). DR negatively correlated significantly (r=–0.69*) with mean-weight diameter (MWD). The SOC positively correlated with water-stable aggregates (WSA) >2.00 mm (r=0.71*). Again the SOC was found to relate significantly with WSA sizes 0.50–0.25 mm, WSA<0.25 and the soil bulk density. These relationships between WDC, SOC and exchangeable acidity including the pH have further demonstrated the significant role that SOC can play in the stability of these soils. The net negative charge of the soil also was shown to play a very significant role in clay dispersion. It is therefore recommended that in these tropical soils with high WDC, higher application levels of organic matter should always be applied to the soil not only to improve fertility but to maintain ideal soil aggregates with less water-disperseve potential.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Salinity is one of the most damaging agro-environmental problems limiting plant growth and development in most parts of the world. The problem of salinity existed long before human beings and the start of agricultural practice and today it has become a very serious problem for crop production, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, which constitute about one third of the world's land surface. The magnitude of genetic variation for salinity tolerance in spring wheat and broad-sense heritabilities has been estimated at different salinity levels. The 68 genotypes responded with different behaviors to increasing salinity levels in the growing medium. Responses of different genotypes to increased salinity levels in reduced growth were found, with those originating from Australia exhibiting a significant increase in salinity tolerance compared with others, originating from Pakistan. Plant vigor and salinity tolerance were found to have no significant correlation as measured by relative growth rates in saline environments. The relative growth rate of various accessions grouped on the basis of different geographic origin and different genes of various stresses also were not different significantly from each other, which suggests that different genes may be controlling the characteristic, from a single major dominant or from recessive genes. Estimated broad-sense heritability indicated that phenotypic variance exceeded that of genotypic by nearly two orders of magnitude. This study was to determine genetic and phenotypic relationships between plant performance in the presence of NaCl at three developmental stages in wheat. These results suggest that improvement in salinity tolerance in spring wheat is possible through selection and breeding.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The leaf leachate of Inula falconeri Hook. f. has been reported to carry allelopathic potential. To analyse its further effects, it was fractionated into five subfractions, i.e. hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water. The hexane subfraction had the highest specific activity compared with the other four fractions and presented 100% inhibitory effect to germination of lettuce seeds. Chloroform subfraction presented a dose-response effect, and the ethyl acetate subfraction exhibited insignificant inhibitory effect, while n-butanol and water subfractions presented stimulatory effects. Elemental analysis through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed the composition of 15 different elements with carbon, oxygen, and potassium showing highest weight percentages. In the case of hexane subfraction, highest percentages of silver (1.22%), cadmium (1.44%), manganese (0.71%), and chromium (0.70%) were observed, compared with other subfractions. Chloroform subfraction has high proportions of copper (0.63%), nickel (0.45%), iron (0.37%), calcium (0.22%), and cobalt (0.08%). In the case of ethyl acetate subfraction oxygen (49.66%) and sodium (0.33%) percentage was the highest of all the subfractions, while the other elements were observed in lesser amounts than in other subfractions. The n-butanol subfraction has recorded highest weight of zinc (0.79%) compared with other subfractions while in water subfraction significant amounts of other elements were not observed. To investigate the behaviour of these subfractions against plant pathogens, hexane subfraction (concentration gradients of 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/disc) demonstrated significant zones of inhibition against Alternaria alternata and Rhizoctonia solani while only an insignificant effect against Fusarium oxysporum. Thus, using active natural inhibitors of plant pathogens reveals broader perspectives and interests in avoiding losses to cash crops in the local area.",

This makes for a high risk for fertilizer-derived nitrogen losses. However, relatively little attention has been given to fertilizer efficiency in this region. In this study, ammonia volatilization at natural field conditions as affected by urea-application rate was measured to evaluate the potential ammonia volatilization losses. Nitrogen-leaching potential in the 0–100 cm soil profile as affected by urea-application rate and -application depth for different rainfall-simulated irrigation regimes (two irrigation volumes: 70 and 105 mm; two irrigation methods: single irrigation and three-split irrigation) was also investigated. Results showed that the low initial soil moisture content at the crop-planting stage and a strong following rainfall made ammonia volatilization of low importance from an agricultural management perspective. The stock percentage of urea-derived nitrogen in the soil profile was significantly affected by irrigation method and irrigation volume but not by urea-application rate. Generally, the 105 mm irrigation volume and the single-irrigation method had a lower percentage of applied nitrogen remaining in the soil profile. The results of this rainfall-simulated irrigation investigation indicated that heavy rainfall, especially occurring in large storms, in this area increased the risk of nitrogen leaching. We recommend that split applications of urea should be adopted instead of a conventional lumped (single) application to reduce nitrogen losses in this rainfed semiarid region.",

Land use in the Loess Plateau has undergone great changes in the past five decades. To understand the effects of these changes on soil chemical and biological properties in the Loess Plateau, we determined soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and soil microbial biomass nitrogen (SMBN), and basal respiration in millet cropland (MC), grazed grassland (GG) and enclosed grassland (EG). Grazing exclusion led to an increase of SOC and TN. Compared with the MC, the two grasslands had higher SOC and TN values in the 0–10 cm layer, but lower values in the 20–30 cm layer. SMBC and SMBN values in the EG were intermediate between the MC and GG. Conversion of cropland to grassland increased soil basal respiration (SR) and metabolic quotient (qCO2), while grazing exclusion resulted in higher SR but lower qCO2. The study suggests that grassland enclosure could increase SOM as well as soil microbial biomass and activity, and conventional cropland might be the optimal land-use type to maintain soil chemical and biological properties in the Loess Plateau, China.",

The dehydrogenase activity recorded the highest value in undisturbed forest (4.68 µg TPF g−1 h−1) and lowest in barren land (0.74 µg TPF g−1 h−1). The acid phosphatase activities varied between different systems; being lowest in barren land followed by fodder, soybean-wheat, organic system, and the highest in undisturbed forest soil. The average alkaline phosphatase activity ranged from 13.3 µg PNP g−1 h−1 in barren land to 139.9 µg PNP g−1 h−1 in undisturbed forest. The average arylsulfatase activity ranged from 7.30 µg PNP g−1 h−1 in barren land to 184.9 µg PNP g−1 h−1 in undisturbed forest. Most of the enzyme activities showed higher values in summer and at 0–5 cm depth. Significant positive correlations were obtained between enzyme activities and various carbon fractions such as microbial biomass C, particulate organic C and labile C, of which labile carbon was found to be the most strongly associated fraction with the enzyme activities. Our study thus revealed that the cultivation of Himalayan soils has significantly reduced the enzyme activities and that needs adequate attention for long-term sustainable use of soil resources in the region.",

The objectives were to examine the relationship between trigonelline (TRG) accumulation and yield traits in 10 peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) genotypes inoculated with two commonly used nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium spp., and to evaluate a role of TRG on growth traits. TRG increased as a defensive metabolite in response to water deficit, but resulted in the reduction of the number of nodules and yield. Symbiotic rhizobial activity helped plants to improve yield particularly in a fully irrigated field rather than under reduced irrigation. TRG concentrations in genotypes (7 out of 10) increased under reduced irrigation as compared with those under full irrigation in two years. Mean number of nodules at maturity (120 days after planting) across genotypes under reduced irrigation were 89 in the control, 111 in Lift, and 161 in Histick treatments, among which Histick was significant (p < 0.05) for nodulation. Mean pod yields in the control, Histick, and Lift treatments were 1.69, 2.34 and 1.87 Mg ha-1, respectively, under reduced irrigation. Under full irrigation, pod yields were 3.35 in the control, 4.50 in Histick and 3.41 Mg ha-1 in Lift treatments, but were more significantly improved as treated with Histick than other treatments. Genotype ICGS-76 produced the highest pod yield (5.13 Mg ha-1) as treated with Histick. All genotypes treated with Histick and Lift biosynthesized less TRG (decreased from 5.8 to 65.3% relative to the control) but produced larger numbers of pods (increased from 9.2 to 80.4% relative to the control), which resulted in substantially higher pod yields.",

We compared SWRCs calculated using textural composition, organic matter content (SOM) and bulk density as input to these PTFs to pairs of measured water content and matric potential. The measured SWRCs and PTF input data were from 540 soil horizons on agricultural land in Norway. We used various statistical indicators to evaluate the PTFs, including an integrated index by Donatelli et al. (2004). The Riley PTFs showed good overall performance. The soil specific version of Riley is preferred over the layer specific, as the latter may introduce a negative change in water content with increasing matric potential (h). Among the parameter PTFs, Wösten's continuous PTF showed the overall best performance, closely followed by Rawls&B and Vereecken. The ANN-based continuous PTF of Schaap showed poorer performance than its regression based counterparts. Systematic errors related to both particle size and SOM caused the class PTFs to perform poorly; these PTFs do not use SOM as input, and are therefore inappropriate for soils in Norway, being highly variable in SOM. The PTF performance showed little difference between soil groups. Water contents in the dry range of the SWRC were generally better predicted than water contents in the wet range. Pedotransfer functions that included both SOM and measured bulk density as input, i.e. Wösten, Vereecken and Rawls&B, performed best in the wet range.",

The study was conducted in district Sheikhupura, Punjab province, Pakistan. Five fields with different management activities were sampled for spiders using pitfall traps and a visual search method. A total of 23,097 specimens of spiders belonging to 47 species, 21 genera and 12 families were recorded during the study. There was a difference in the density and richness of spiders and high density was recorded in the zero-tillage sown fields and lowest in low-input fields. However, the diversity and evenness did not differ with the habitat types. The analysis of agrobiont species distribution showed that hunting spiders were abundant in zero-tillage sown wheat and orb webs in wheat fields edged with Brassica napus crop. Density of spiders in fields was associated with aphid and collembolan density. Based on this study we can suggest that diversification of management activities can be helpful to maintain spider diversity in the crop which can be helpful in pest management activities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most hybrid maize samples from three years of field experiments in Zambia contained Fusarium spp., but there were differences between hybrid susceptibility in two agroecological zones. Mean annual kernel infection ranged from 14 to 63% in the medium rainfall zone (MRZ). In the high rainfall zone (HRZ), the highest mean annual infection recorded was 18%. A Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis showed negative relationship between Fusarium kernel infection and rainy days before midsilk and positive relationship between Fusarium kernel infection and number of dry weeks between planting and midsilk. Fusarium verticillioides was most frequently isolated, and the highest incidences and levels were found in the MRZ. Other species detected included: Fusarium subglutinans, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium compactum, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium proliferatum, Fusarium nygamai, Fusarium semitectum and Fusarium anthophilum. This is the first report of the presence of F. compactum, F. nygamai and F. anthophilum in maize in Zambia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The hot water extractable organic carbon (HWEOC) and K2Cr2O7 oxidizable organic carbon (OOC) have been suggested as indicators to assess soil management effects on soil organic matter; however, traditional methods for measuring these C fractions are costly and tedious. The potential of using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) with partial least squares (PLS) regression to predict HWEOC and OOC concentrations in cultivated and uncultivated Mollisols in China were explored in this paper. The soil organic carbon (SOC), OOC, and HWEOC in 0–30 cm layer were 37.6, 41.2, and 58.8% lower in cultivated than in uncultivated soils. The HWEOC is more sensitive to soil management relative to SOC or OOC. HWEOC concentrations were accurately predicted using NIRS-PLS model, with high coefficient of determination (R 2=0.89), residual prediction deviation (RPD=3.69) for model calibration, and high R 2 (0.85), RPD (3.03), and correlation coefficient (r=0.92) of predicted and measured values in the validation set. Excellent prediction for OOC was acquired with R 2 and RPD at 0.97 and 6.11 for model calibration, respectively, and R 2 and RPD and r at 0.92, 5.75, and 0.97 for model validation, respectively. This study indicated that the HWEOC could be used to illustrate the impacts of agronomic management on soil quality. Both of HWEOC and OOC can be accurately quantified using NIRS-PLS approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mechanical control through different tillage methods is a common measure against perennial weeds. However, non-optimal tillage can potentially increase the vegetative regeneration instead of reducing it. Aspects of regenerative capacity in the perennial weed species Rumex crispus L. was studied in three pot and box experiments as follows: (1) regeneration from different root fragments under varying test conditions; (2) effects of root size and burial depth on time of emergence and emergence rate; and (3) effects of burial depth and cutting on biomass production and seed production. In experiment 1, sprouting occurred mainly from the neck of the roots, consisting of underground stem tissue. A few shoots were observed also from the upper half of the true taproot and from a side root. No difference in sprouting was found between test conditions. In experiment 2, total emergence rate was positively related to root size and negatively related to burial depth. Time to first emergence was defined by an interaction between the two factors. Roots larger than 100 g gave rise to a high degree of emergence from all burial depths, while emergence from roots weighing 20–30 g was less than 30% from 12 cm and nonexistent from 18 cm. When emergence and shoot production were tested under different cutting regimes (experiment 3), the separated top fragments of the roots sprouted faster and produced more shoot biomass than intact rootstocks, even at a second harvest. Our results indicate that fragmentation can stimulate sprouting from the regenerative tissue of the taproot. Hence, if tillage is carried out as weed control it is important that root fragments are buried at ploughing depth, especially if the population consists of adult plants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Competition is one of the main forms of interaction between cultivated crops and their neighboring plants. Allelopathy is a chemical mechanism that gives plants an advantage in competing for limited resources. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has recently been introduced to China's Loess Plateau. As a non-native species, the competitive or allelopathic effects of switchgrass plants or switchgrass residue could have an important effect on weed growth in the switchgrass stand. In this field experiment, we investigated the effect of eight switchgrass cultivars (Blackwell, Cave-in-Rock, Dakota, Forestberg, Illinois USA, Nebraska 28, Pathfinder, and Sunburst) on associated weed growth. Weed density and biomass under each switchgrass cultivar were measured on four dates during the growing season. The effect of switchgrass residue on associated weed growth was also studied. Almost all of the switchgrass cultivars suppressed weed growth early in the growing season; however, Cave-in-Rock was the only switchgrass cultivar that significantly suppressed weed growth throughout the entire growing season. There was a significant negative relationship between switchgrass biomass and weed biomass during the middle part of the growing season (i.e., 28 July and 30 August). This indicated that the competitive effects of switchgrass had the greatest effect on weed growth during this stage. The residue of Blackwell, Illinois USA, and Pathfinder suppressed weed growth more than the growing switchgrass plants did. These results have implications for weed management strategies in agroecosystems and provide important information for the introduction of switchgrass to new ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The effects of seedbed properties on emergence of various crops were studied in a series of experiments. Results for crops with seeds weighing <7 mg are reported here. The experiments were carried out in shallow plastic boxes placed directly on the ground in the field. Small seeds require shallow sowing, which is a great disadvantage in the event of dry weather after sowing, particularly on clay and clay loam soils, where the upper 3-cm soil layer quickly dries to wilting point. Nevertheless, good emergence of crops with seeds weighing 2–7 mg (white mustard, Sinapis alba L., oilseed rape, Brassica rapa L., Metzg., sugar beet, Beta vulgaris L. and red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) was often obtained when the seed was placed at about 3-cm depth directly on a firm basal layer with >6% plant-available water and covered by soil dominated by aggregates <5 mm. Cruciferous crops germinated most rapidly, which facilitated emergence from shallow depth. Sowing could be slightly shallower in coarse-textured than in fine-textured soils, since the former soils dry less rapidly to below wilting point. For timothy (Phleum pratense L.) with seeds weighing about 0.5 mg and requiring a sowing depth <2.5 cm, it was impossible to design a seedbed that eliminated the risk of poor emergence in dry weather. Firming of the seedbed after sowing favoured emergence only in initially dry seedbeds. The risk of poor emergence because of surface layer hardening was minimised by placing seeds at a depth and in seedbed conditions that promoted the fastest possible emergence.",

    "abstract": "Plant nutrition conditions are limited in naturally acidic soil due to harmful hydrogen and aluminium ions. More favourable conditions for plant nutrition (soil liming) will affect root qualitative and quantitative parameters and influence ecosystem stability. Four legume–grass swards were cultivated. The swards were a combination of one species of legume and two species of grasses: Trifolium pratense L., Trifolium repens L., Trifolium hybridum L., Medicago sativa L. (each of 50%) with Phleum pratense L. (35%) and Poa pratensis L. (15%). The aim of this study is to evaluate the root morphological and soil biological indicators of legume–grass swards under the first two years of development in soils with different pH levels.Sward ecosystem development depends on the pH of the soil, sward species composition and soil biota. During the first year of sward development, soil pH had a significant influence on the morphology of root system. Sward‘s root mass and total root length was 2.4 and 2.2 times bigger in naturally acidic soil. This resulted in a change of biological parameters.In the second year of sward development, soil pH had no significant influence on sward‘s root mass. However, under the impact of different soil pH, various sward‘s root systems were formed and the root C:N ratio had changed. It is observed that, regardless of the sward species composition and the year of development, at higher root C:N ratio soil microbial biomass was higher and CO2 emissions were lower in swards in naturally acidic soils.Regardless of soil pH, different types of clover–grass swards promoted organic carbon immobilization in microbial biomass and, at the same time, stabilized the sward ecosystem in the top soil layer (soil respiration in 0–10 and 10–20 cm layers was lower) more effectively than the alfalfa–grass sward.",

    "abstract": "African ginger (Siphonochilus aethiopicus), as a medicinal plant, is known for its medicinal properties, containing various antioxidant compounds and carbohydrates. Rhizome yield is improved by water regimens and fertilizers applied at plant phenological stages. However, the rhizomatous herb, which is traditionally used for the treatment of asthma, inflammation and malaria has limited information on water and nitrogen requirements for its production. This study assessed the effect of irrigation regimens (30%, 50% and 70% allowable depletion level (ADL) and nitrogen (N) levels (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha−1) on antioxidant activity and carbohydrates on plant leaf, root and rhizome. The interaction treatment effect of severely stressed (70% ADL) with the N application of 100 kg ha−1 had significant effect on leaf phenolic concentration (87.02 ± 2.51 mg g−1 gallic acid equivalent). Interaction effect of moderately stressed (50% ADL) and severely stressed (70% ADL) treatment with N application rate of 0 kg ha−1 had significant effect on plant flavonoids and phenolics in all plant parts. In plant carbohydrates, root had high sucrose content (47.68 ± 9.0 mg g−1 dry weight) with the application of low N (0 kg ha−1) grown under severely stressed treatment. In conclusion, this implies that different S. aethiopicus parts can produce substantial amount of antioxidants and carbohydrates, as exhibited under low N and reduced water supply applied during the phenological cycle.",

Thus, the present study aimed to assess different times of ASM application to Meloidogyne javanica control in lettuce. Lettuce seedlings were produced in trays, transplanted to pots 25 days after germination and inoculated with 2000 eggs of the nematode.

The untreated plants formed the control group. Fifty days later, these plants were collected and evaluated the nematological and vegetative parameters. The treatments promoted a decrease in M. javanica population higher than 60% when applied until 5 DAT and generally did not interfere with the vegetative parameters of lettuce, and ASM can be adopted as an alternative for the root-knot nematodes management.",

The Steiner solution (SS) was used as a control (Treatment IV).Results: Yield did not differ between organic and conventional treatments, ranging from 3.04 to 3.35 kg m-2 while fresh weight in organic treatments was 3.14 compared to 3.2 kg m-2 in plants fed with the SS. No significant differences in plant height or fruit quality were found. The application of organic fertilizers positively affected the total hydrolysable and condensed polyphenols of tomato fruits compared to the control. Twelve phenolic compounds were identified, highlighting 3-Caffeoylquinic acid, salvianolic acid and 5,6-Dihydroxy-7,8,3',4'-tetramethoxyflavone (Treatment I) and Medioresinol (Lignan) (Treatment II).Conclusions: The results indicated that organic fertilization through animal-based fertilizer application is a feasible alternative for grape tomato production under greenhouse conditions.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of phenological phase of the shoots and the use of rooting stimulants of plant origin on the relationship between rooting abilities and the carbohydrate content in leaves and stems of cuttings. Single-node stem cuttings of Rosa beggeriana 'Polstjärnan' and Rosa helenae 'Semiplena' were harvested from shoots in four phenological stages: flower buds closed (P1), flowers open (P2), immediately after petal shedding (P3), and 7–14 days after petal fall (P4). The following rooting enhancers were used: 0.4% indole butyric acid (IBA) (Ukorzeniacz Aaqua); 0.2% naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) (Ukorzeniacz Baqua); Bio Rhizotonic; and Root Juice™; Bio Roots. Controls included untreated cuttings. The contents of reducing and total soluble carbohydrates in leaves and shoots were estimated before and after rooting. The rooting percentage and rooting degree were determined. A relatively high or moderate natural rooting ability without any treatment were shown by R. beggeriana 'Polstjärnan' in 63.8%–87.5% and by R. helenae 'Semiplena' in 41.3%–72.5% cuttings. IBA and NAA decreased the mean rooting percentage in 'Polstjärnan', but increased it for P4 cuttings in 'Semiplena'. None of the preparations had any impact on the degree of rooting. The mean level of total soluble and reducing sugars in leaves and stems of cuttings before rooting was lower than that of after root formation. The preparations of plant origin positively affected rhizogenesis and sugar contents in plant tissues, but their effect depended on shoot's phenological phase and cultivar. Plant origin preparations may successfully replace those containing IBA or NAA.",

Significant differences (P < 0.01) were detected among tested genotypes for all measured traits. Days to flowering varied from 62 to 152 with a mean of 93. Plant height varied from 90 to 420 cm with a mean of 236 cm. Stem diameter ranged from 7 to 31 mm with a mean of 16 mm. Biomass yield varied from 6.668 to 111.2 t ha−1 with a mean of 30 t ha−1. Stalk dry matter content ranged from 17.2% to 44.2% with a mean of 29.8%, while fibre content varied from 8.92% to 34.8% with a mean of 17.2%.

The best ethanol producing genotypes were AS203, AS391, AS205, AS251 and AS448. Days to flowering, plant height, stalk brix and stem diameter exerted the greatest indirect effects on ethanol production through higher biomass production. Biomass yield had the greatest direct effect on ethanol production. Therefore, the above traits should be considered during breeding sorghum for bio-ethanol production. Also, the traits had high heritability values, hence selection should provide for good genetic gains. Overall, the above sweet stem sorghum genotypes are useful genetic resources for breeding of sorghum with enhanced bio-ethanol production.",

Indeed, stressed plants showed decrease of plant growth and phosphorus use efficiency. The efficiency use of rhizobial symbiosis was also affected by salinity. However, addition of two different level of phosphorus (37 and 55 mM) to saline soil increased significantly availability of P in plant organs. Specially, the (150 mM NaCl × 37 mM P) mixture increased (33%) phosphorus use efficiency, induced better nodulation and increased plant biomass which results in the high efficiency in use of the rhizobial symbiosis.

Genetic control of Striga through resistance is widely considered to be the most practical and economically feasible method for long term control. The paper presents a comprehensive account of the Striga resistance mechanisms and environmental limitations to their usage in sub-Saharan Africa. Components of Striga resistance in cereals and legumes include low germination stimulant production, low haustorial initiation factor, mechanical barriers, incompatibility, antibiosis and Striga avoidance due to root growth habits. The successful exploitation of resistance has been limited by existence of specificity towards hosts, parasites that have evolved races specific host cultivars, Striga genetic variance which enables parasite to adapt to new resistance alleles and diverse hosts which support the parasite even in the absence of cereals together with low fertility due to nutrient mining in the smallholder sector. The results imply that different resistance mechanism may need to be present in genetically heterogeneous varieties or cereals with different resistance mechanisms may be rotated in the same field. Comprehensive Striga management systems should also address soil fertility in the small holder farmers of sub-Saharan Africa.",

The experiment begins in 1986, and including five treatments: without fertiliser input, chemical fertiliser alone, rice straw residue and chemical fertiliser, low organic manure rate and chemical fertiliser and high organic manure rate and chemical fertiliser. The results showed that the application of chemical fertiliser greatly enhanced PNA and AOB abundance, while application of rice straw residue and organic manure increased AOA abundance. Moreover, the results showed that the PNA and population sizes of AOB and AOA were higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. Cluster and redundancy analyses further indicated that the rhizosphere effect play a more important role in shaping AOA community structure than long-term fertilization. In summary, the results indicated that AOB rather than AOA functionally dominate ammonia oxidation in the double-cropping rice paddy soils, and that rhizosphere effect and fertiliser regime play different roles in the activity and community structures of AOB and AOA.",

Water stress reduced grain yield on the genotypes where stress was imposed at the tillering stage (p < .05); whereas when stress was imposed at flowering and grain filling the grain yield was not reduced (p > .05).

Twenty-four agronomically selected wheat genotypes sourced from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT)'s heat and drought tolerance nursery and four local check varieties were genotyped using 12 selected polymorphic SSR markers. The test genotypes were phenotyped using yield and yield-component traits, and grain protein content (GPC) under non-stressed (NS) and drought-stressed (DS) conditions. Expected heterozygosity mean value of 0.58 indicated moderate genetic diversity for breeding. The studied wheat genotypes were delineated into six genetic groups using cluster analysis. Significant genotypic differences were observed for agronomic traits and GPC under NS and DS conditions. Genetically unrelated breeding parents including LM02, LM13, LM23, LM41, LM44, LM71, LM73 and LM75 were selected for population development and breeding for enhanced grain yield and protein content under heat and drought-stressed environments.",

Treatments consisted of (i) two growing years (2016/2017 and 2017/2018) and (ii) four seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter). The grass was fertilised with 1,000 kg N ha−1 year−1 and sprinkler irrigated, with soil moisture monitored by tensiometry. The evaluated parameters consisted of leaf dry matter, stem dry matter and total dry matter production. The results showed that the irrigated Guinea grass reached an elevated production of dry matter (DM), with the highest yields occurring in the spring/summer period, evidencing the yiel gap in the autumn/winter. The grass showed high daily forage accumulation, expressing high productive potential, demonstrating a good indicator for animal production in intensive systems with irrigated and fertilised pastures for regions of tropical climate.

Infectious stage (J2s) and egg masses of M. incognita were exposed to different concentrations (2500, 2000, 1500, 1000, and 500 ppm) of chitosan and botanical extracts separately. Maximum mortality of J2s and the highest inhibition in egg hatching was observed at 2500 ppm of chitosan after 36 h and days incubation period, respectively and minimum found in 500 ppm of A. aspera after 12 h of incubation period. Furthermore, pots treated with 1 g chitosan and 30 g of freshly chopped leaves of all three tested botanicals significantly reduced pathological parameters and improved growth and photosynthetic attributes of carrot. In combination with botanicals, chitosan showed a synergistic effect against M. incognita on carrot as compared to chitosan alone. This study proves that chitosan's bio-efficacy, combined with selected three botanicals, could be utilised to manage M. incognita on the carrot as a potential sustainable treatment.",

Studies reported superior yields of triticale compared to wheat under suboptimal conditions like drought. The worldwide importance of triticale, however, is low and research on this crop is scarce. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the development, growth, nitrogen (N) uptake and N utilisation of two autumn- and spring-sown facultative triticale varieties in two consecutive growing seasons under temperate climate conditions in Central Europe. Autumn-sown facultative triticale showed slower development, earlier harvest dates, higher soil coverage early in the season as well as higher crop stand height, above-ground dry matter, crop growth rate, N yield and N utilisation efficiency. Spring sowing of facultative triticale, however, resulted in a higher relative growth rate, N concentration and relative N uptake rate. Drought stress in the second season affected crop stand height, soil coverage, above-ground dry matter, crop growth rate, N concentration, N yield, N utilisation efficiency, soil water content and soil mineral N content. Autumn-sown triticale showed better adaption to dry conditions compared to spring-sown triticale. Among varieties, cv. Agrano performed better under optimal and cv.

The apple orchard was intercropped with native grasses (NG), red clover (RC; Trifolium pratense L.), ryegrass (RE; Trifolium repens L.), and no vegetation (CT control; clean tillage). We obtained soil samples from depths of 0–20, 20–40, and 40–60 cm from the different treatment plots in the orchard and analysed them using a high-throughput DNA sequencing technique. The three forage crops had affected the soil bacterial and fungal community structures. Compared with CT control, intercropping with NG increased the proportion of Acidobacteria and reduced those of Nitrospirae and Verrucomicrobia, whereas intercropping with RC increased the proportions of Nitrospirae and Verrucomicrobia and reduced that of Planctomycetes. Intercropping with RE increased the proportions of Nitrospirae and Chloroflexi, whereas reduced that of Acidobacteria. Furthermore, unlike in the other treatments, intercropping with NG increased the proportion of Zygomycota in the 0–20-cm soil layer. Intercropping with RC increased the proportion of Chytridiomycota in all the three soil layers, whereas intercropping with RE increased the proportion of Basidiomycota in the 20–40-cm soil layer. Collectively, these findings suggest that intercropping with forage crops, especially RC, in an apple orchard, could alter soil microbial community structure. In our previous study, we showed that microbial sole-carbon-source utilisation is changed by intercropping with forage crops; thus, it can be considered as an effective approach to improve the efficiency of soil C cycling in the apple orchard by altering the microbial community structure.",

    "abstract": "Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants and its deficiency is a well-documented problem, causing decreased yields and nutritional quality. An orchard experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of iron fertilization on some nut traits and mineral compositions of 'Tombul' hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) variety cultivated in the Black Sea Region of Turkey. In addition, the contributions of these nuts on human nutrition were determined. Hazelnuts were fertilized with 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 kg ha−1 iron in each year during three consecutive years. Iron fertilization significantly affected nut traits and mineral compositions of the nuts. The amounts of total oil, kernel percentage, and kernel weight increased and the amounts of empty and wrinkle nuts decreased with 12 kg ha−1 Fe fertilization. Different iron doses caused slightly different protein content and kernel shape in the kernels. The phosphorus, iron, and boron contents of nut increased significantly with 8 kg ha−1 Fe fertilization. In order to improve some nut traits and mineral compositions of hazelnut, 8 kg ha−1 and 12 kg ha−1 Fe fertilizations could be recommended for practice. According to daily nutrition element requirements, the quantity of 100 g hazelnut provided about 43.12% for P, 12.93% for K, 19.09% for Ca, 36.97% for Mg, 0.18% for Na, 50.88% for Fe, 25.00% for Zn, 14.15% for B, and 77.33% for Mo of the recommended dietary allowances. Cu and Mn contents of 100 g hazelnut were higher than the respective daily requirements. This research indicated that hazelnut is a rich source of mineral elements, and 'Tombul' hazelnut can be an important source of mineral elements for human nutrition with health beneficial impact.",

However, as for cotton genotypes with different K efficiency, how they related to the absorption patterns under K starvation is not fully understood. In this hydroponic experiment, plants were grown at different K levels: low (K1, 2 mg/L) and adequate K level (K2, 20 mg/L) for 2 weeks. K+ absorption kinetic parameters were got by Michaelis–Menten equation. By applying K channel-blocking agent, tetraethylammonium and protein modifying reagent N-ethylmaleimide, we evaluated the differences in K absorption mechanisms for two typical cotton genotypes (K-efficient genotype 103 and K-inefficient genotype 122). Results showed that higher affinity to K+ and better root formation of genotype 103 resulting in better adaptation in low-K+ condition, whether grown in low or adequate K+ environment. Further study with K+ absorption inhibitors suggested the two genotypes grown in low-K+ environment absorbed K+ mainly by high-affinity K+ absorption systems, and for seedlings grown in adequate K condition, genotype 103 absorbed K+ with both K channels and high-affinity proton and mainly by high-affinity K channels, while genotype 122 absorbed K+ by K channels. These results indicated that the low-K condition could induce higher affinity to absorb K+, and the two cottons with different K efficiency mainly due to different low-K adaptation and absorb K+ with different patterns. This could provide a possible theory for the selection of K-efficient varieties.",

Extracted Si from rice hull ash has the same molecular structure as the conventional Si liquid fertiliser, increasing one or two dumbbell Si cells on the surface of a leaf.

In order to investigate whether Se supplied as either selenate or selenite can increase germination and growth compared with low-Se controls we used broccoli, an important vegetable with anticancer effects, especially when biofortified with Se. Broccoli was grown under both Zn adequacy and Zn deficiency to determine whether interactions between these minerals affect plant growth. Selenite and selenate at a wide range of doses increased the speed and extent of germination. Both inorganic Se forms increased early root and shoot growth at low concentrations, with selenite having a stronger effect than selenate. A sand culture trial showed a similar growth increase due to low-dose Se under Zn deficiency but not under Zn adequacy. Conversely, at high Se levels, the results provided evidence from biomass, water use, photosynthesis and gas exchange that broccoli growth was inhibited at high Se levels, with selenite being more toxic than selenate. In this broccoli trial, the two Se forms were equally effective in increasing leaf Se concentration, whereas in most plants selenite is largely converted to organic Se forms and stored in the roots. This study suggests that Se, supplied either as selenate or selenite, may improve germination and growth in broccoli, especially on Zn-deficient soils. Field trials conducted on soils which are very low in both plant-available Se and Zn are needed.",

    "abstract": "Different irrigation and fertilization managements can greatly affect plant potassium (K) uptake in soils. A continuous extraction experiment was used to analyze the influence of poor-quality irrigation water on K release from soils under long-term copping with different fertilizations. The results demonstrated that K release kinetics included a rapid stage and a subsequent slow one. K leached in the solution with Ca:Mg ratio 75:25 and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) 45 was minimum (146 mg kg−1), while K leached in the solution with Ca:Mg ratio 25:75 and SAR 5 was maximum (212 mg kg−1). Due to the specific ion effect, Mg2+ played a more important role in the release of K than Ca2+. The K release rates and quantities of released K in the soils without K fertilizers were lower than others. Long-term planting without K fertilizers results in the decrease of K fertility. Power equation and parabolic equation fully simulated the process of K release, suggesting a diffusion-controlled process. The K extracted by saline water may be more available to plants or be leached down below root zone. Therefore, much K will be leached by saline water in the long run, especially by water containing large numbers of Mg2+. Without any K input, K fertility of soils will decrease under long-term cropping. Thus, there is an urgent need for the improvement of irrigation and K fertilization managements in soils.",

    "abstract": "The increasing scarcity of water for irrigation and environmental pollution due to excessive use of fertilizers are the important problems in vegetable production. A field experiment with combination of three levels of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization was employed to optimize the irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer usage of spinach. Traits, yields, quality, and economic factors of spinach under different regimes were determined. The yield was the highest when spinach was grown under the condition of the soil water content at 16.5% combined with 170 kg ha−1 of nitrogen fertilizer, while the lowest yield was recorded for the one under the soil water content at 12.5% with 0 kg ha−1. Nitrate and oxalate contents of spinach were highly dependent on levels of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization. Nitrogen fertilization significantly decreased nitrogen use efficiency. Both water use efficiency and profit responded positively to increased nitrogen fertilizer usage. To optimize the quality and earnings of spinach, and consider the fact that nitrogen fertilizer could degrade the quality of spinach, application of the nitrogen fertilizer at 85 kg ha−1 and maintenance of the soil water content at 16.5% could be recommended for spinach cultivation under field conditions. Therefore, the findings in this present study are important to improve our knowledge of the irrigation and fertilization for the sustainable agriculture.",

The abundance and the number of faunal families were higher in conservation tillage systems than in the CT. The RT system had the highest individual number of soil fauna among three tillage methods. The faunal accumulation in the soil surface also was significantly higher in the two conservation tillage systems than in the CT.

Flight activity of the three bee species during the pollination-receptive period of the cultivar ‘Stevnsbaer’ was recorded. Also, using insect-proof cages constructed around ‘Stevnsbaer’ trees, fruit set and yield were recorded and compared with self-pollination in the absence of insects and open pollination. When floral development and seasonal conditions are suitable, there is a potential role for introduced Osmia rufa and B. terrestris to add to the pollination activity of conventionally employed A. mellifera. However, in a season with a less favourable weather history, and despite comparable activity of the three species during the pollen-receptive period, introduced bees had only a limited effect on fruit set and yield and could not raise yield above that of freely pollinated branches. The contribution of appropriately dense populations of introduced bees in the orchard, given favourable weather conditions, is clear, but maintenance of populations of introduced, wild bees, compared with honey bees may well be impractical due to cost. Known ecological risks associated with species introduction also need to be considered. Consequently, if wild bee populations are to be used to secure the potential benefits of increased fruit set and yield, then positive habitat management will be necessary to sustain the required populations.",

Two years (2000–2001, 2006–2007) research was carried out to evaluate the effect of water quality on yield and quality of fennel, a vegetable very common in Apulia region. We compared two types of soil and two sodium absorption ratio of irrigation water obtained by dissolving in distilled water NaCl + CaCl2 (1:1) or only NaCl, and four electrical conductivity of water of 0.7 (control), 4, 8 and 12 dS m−1. The soil type does not show any noticeable effect on the tested parameters. The salt type influenced the plant development and the total soluble solids contained in the bulbs. The plant height, the leaf and the bulb weight were, respectively, 6, 11 and 21% higher in NaCl + CaCl2 treatment as compared to NaCl one. The plant height, the leaf and the bulb weight dropped, respectively, by 33, 49 and 71%, shifting from 0.7 to 12 dS m−1 salinity treatments. The dry matter content and total soluble solids increased with rising salinity. In fact, shifting from the control to the more saline treatment, the leaves and the bulbs dry matter increased, respectively, by 15 and 13%, and total soluble solids increased by 17%. Moreover, the increase in salinity favoured the production of flattened bulbs. The application of the Maas and Hoffman model to salinity response confirms the ranking of this species among moderately salt sensitive species, even though the critical threshold was the same for NaCl and NaCl + CaCl2 treatments (1.26 dS m−1), while the slope was higher in NaCl treatment (14.24% m dS−1) than NaCl + CaCl2 (10.39% m dS−1).",

It is a salinity-tolerant plant, but much genetic variation exists among its genotypes. Genetic diversity has been shown to exist from a morphologic level to a molecular level among Chinese natural bermudagrass germplasm resources; however, the extent of variation in their salinity tolerance has remained unclear. We conducted greenhouse hydroponic and sand culture experiments to evaluate the variation in salinity tolerance of natural bermudagrass germplasm resources obtained from their main areas of distribution in China and treated at a 33 dS m−1 salinity level for three weeks. Compared with non-saline controls, salinity stress significantly decreased shoot clipping weight (46.5% and 44.2%) and increased leaf firing (41.1% and 37.6%) in hydroponic and sand culture experiments, respectively, across all genotypes. However, significant genetic variations in relative leaf firing percentage (RLF) and relative shoot weight (RSW) were found among genotypes in both experiments, and their coefficients of variation ranged from 25.5% to 41.6%, indicating that considerable variation exists in the salinity tolerance of Chinese natural bermudagrass germplasm resources. Shoot Na+ concentrations increased under salinity stress for all genotypes in both experiments. However, significant genetic variations were also found in shoot Na+ concentrations. Salinity tolerance in bermudagrass genotypes was found to be significantly negatively correlated with shoot Na+ concentrations in both experiments. Using a cluster analysis of RLF and RSW data, all genotypes were classified into four groups with different salinity tolerances. The results of our evaluation indicate that there is much potential for improving salinity tolerance among Chinese natural bermudagrass cultivars.",

Results showed that the application of chelants significantly affected the plant height and biomass with significant varietal difference. EDTA treatment resulted in reduced plant height and biomass in all cultivars tested, while EDDS application increased the plant height and aboveground biomass in most of the cultivars. Both chelants significantly increased the shoot Cd contents, being up to 60% and 54% more than those of control after EDTA and EDDS treatments, respectively. The chelants were found to reduce the root Cd content by 15% and 12% in EDTA- and EDDS-treated plants, respectively.

    "abstract": "Long-term application of manure to sandy soils to ensure high crop productivity may lead to phosphorus (P) leaching, which, in turn, may deteriorate the quality of recipient waters because of eutrophication. The risk of P leaching depends on contents of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) oxides that are strong P sorbents and of calcium (Ca) that can form sparingly soluble Ca–P compounds. While P sorption by Al and Fe oxides is limited, the formation of sparingly soluble Ca–P may theoretically continue as long as enough Ca is available, i.e. under such conditions long-term application of manure may be environmentally sustainable. This hypothesis has been tested on soils formed on beach sand at Keta, Ghana, which have been used since the 1930s for intensive cultivation based on manure application. Soil samples were collected from different depths down to 80 cm in profile pits on cultivated soils that received manure over 70 years and on uncultivated plots (controls). The samples were analyzed for texture, pH, total C and P and poorly ordered Al and Fe oxides as well as different P forms as assessed by the Hedley fractionation method. The results showed a fourfold P increase in the top 40 cm of the cultivated soils, whereas in the deepest soil layers the P contents in the cultivated and uncultivated soils were almost the same indicating very limited downward P transport despite long-term manure application. This was supported by comparable P concentrations in groundwater taken under cultivated and uncultivated sites. P fractionation showed that the cultivated top soils were dominated by sparingly soluble Ca–P compounds that accounted for about 70% of the P gain. Thus, the results suggest that intensive crop production under tropical semi-arid conditions may be environmentally sustainable when based on manure fertilization ensuring enough Ca supply and neutral to alkaline pH.",

Organic soils used for agriculture contribute a large proportion of anthropogenic GHG emissions, and on-farm mitigation options are important. This field study investigated whether choice of a cropping system can be used to mitigate emissions of N2O and influence CH4 fluxes from cultivated organic and carbon-rich soils during the growing season. Ten different sites in southern Sweden representing peat soils, peaty marl and gyttja clay, with a range of different soil properties, were used for on-site measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes. The fluxes during the growing season from soils under two different crops grown in the same field and same environmental conditions were monitored. Crop intensities varied from grasslands to intensive potato cultivation. The results showed no difference in median seasonal N2O emissions between the two crops compared. Median seasonal emissions ranged from 0 to 919 µg N2O m−2 h−1, with peaks on individual sampling occasions of up to 3317 µg N2O m−2 h−1. Nitrous oxide emissions differed widely between sites, indicating that soil properties are a regulating factor. However, pH was the only soil factor that correlated with N2O emissions (negative exponential correlation). The type of crop grown on the soil did not influence CH4 fluxes. Median seasonal CH4 flux from the different sites ranged from uptake of 36 µg CH4 m−2 h−1 to release of 4.5 µg CH4 m−2 h−1. From our results, it was concluded that farmers cannot mitigate N2O emissions during the growing season or influence CH4 fluxes by changing the cropping system in the field.",

Therefore, the purpose of this assessment was to compare soil coverage, yield and yield components of two winter faba bean varieties (Diva and Hiverna) with a spring faba bean (Alexia) with two seeding rates (SR), 25 versus 50 germinable seeds m−2 (S), in a two-year field experiment under Pannonian climate conditions in eastern Austria. Both winter faba bean varieties produced a high grain yield with 25 S, whereas that of Alexia tended to be higher with 50 S. The grain yield of Diva and Hiverna was with 25 S and that of Diva also with 50 S higher than that of Alexia. The higher SR caused in winter faba beans a higher intraspecific competition resulting in less stems plant−1. Pod density of Alexia was higher with 50 S compared to 25 S, while grains pod−1 and thousand kernel weight of all three varieties were not affected by SR. Results show that winter faba bean can be sown in Central Europe with lower seeding rates compared to spring faba bean without suffering a grain yield loss.",

Therefore, effects of ground limestone (GL) and structure lime (SL1 slaked lime or SL2 mix of ground limestone and slaked lime) were evaluated in southern Sweden on soil structure, growth and nutrient concentration in barley under four fertilisation strategies 1.5–2 years after application. All lime products increased aggregate stability, but with variations between locations. A lower proportion of large aggregates was found in both limed treatments, and a higher proportion of small aggregates in SL. In barley, grain yield was unaffected while shoot numbers and biomass in first node stage increased for GL and biomass increased further for SL. Structure lime increased potassium concentration in plants in first node stage, due to more potassium in the product. Both lime types increased molybdenum concentration. Ground limestone reduced zinc concentration compared with no liming. Finer seedbed tilth and increased aggregate stability may explain increased biomass for GL. Higher potassium content in SL might be a further explanation. No interactions between liming and fertilisation were found. In conclusion, on the soil types studied, no change of fertilisation strategy is needed due to liming.",

    "abstract": "Irrigation is, on one hand, expected to increase the risk of nitrate leaching through increased rates of percolation, but, on the other hand, enhances plant nutrient uptake and growth, thereby limiting the risk of leaching. To investigate this dichotomy, we analysed the effects of irrigation at three nitrogen (N)-application rates in spring barley (Hordeum distichum L., two experiments with 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha−1) and winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L., one experiment with 50, 150, and 250 kg N ha−1) on a coarse sandy soil in Denmark in a humid climate, which facilitates nitrate leaching. Analyses comprised grain/seed dry matter yield, N-uptake, nitrogen use efficiency (partial nitrogen budget, PNB, and partial-factor productivity, PFP) and nitrate leaching. For both crops, increasing N-application without consideration of the crops’ drought-stress responses lead to a relatively lower N-uptake in grain, lower yield, lower PNB and PFP and higher nitrate leaching, although responses were not proportionally to increasing N-application. The effect of irrigation at the lowest N-rates was limited. The non-irrigated treatments with the highest N-rates had a grain/seed yield of 3.2, 2.3 and 0.7 t ha−1 and nitrate leaching rates of 64, 72 and 127 kg N ha−1 compared to a grain/seed yield of 5.3, 5.0 and 2.6 kg N ha−1 and nitrate leaching rates of 61, 42 and 85 kg N ha−1 (for spring barley, spring barley and winter oilseed rape, respectively). These results show that synchronised management of both irrigation and N-application are essential for reducing the risk of nitrate leaching and to promote efficient crop N-uptake in periods of droughts.",

Five weekly yield samplings during the regrowth periods were fitted to an expolinear growth equation to determine initial maximum relative regrowth rates (R m) and maximum regrowth rates (C m).

It was reduced by 50% at jointing, after which there was no change with later cuts. For both species the C m declined sharply with cutting time through the early stages of phenological development, whereas from early heading to anthesis there was no significant change. Compared with timothy, the C m values of meadow fescue were higher after cut at the leaf stage and lower after cut at anthesis. For both species and for all stages of first cut the C m increased with increasing N application, whereas R m was not significantly affected.",

The first group was exposed to 20°C for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks at 5°C, whereas the second group was exposed to 5°C for the entire 24 weeks. The resulting germination was registered in early summer. The remaining non-germinated seeds from both treatments were kept outdoors until the end of October and then at 5°C for 24 weeks. Again, the resulting germination was registered in early summer. Large interspecific differences were noted in overall germination percentages as well as in the response to the various treatments.",

Apart from that, fruit size may be affected by plant material and cropping year, the latter probably related to weather conditions. Achene spacing was influenced by year, and increased by irrigation under drought conditions. Relevance of factors influencing fruit size is discussed. It is concluded that an increase in the number of flower meristems (or a more vigorous vegetative growth) might aggravate internal competition, which in turn impairs flower development, resulting in a reduced flower quality and consequently smaller fruits.

The varieties Puhti and Veli were studied at eight locations over a three-year period from 1988 to 1990. Grain yield, thousand grain weight, protein content and β-glucan content were evaluated in the test varieties. Significant differences were found in these characteristics between years, trials and varieties. The mean β-glucan content of the varieties was higher in 1988 than in 1989 and 1990. The year 1988 was warmer than 1989 and 1990. Grain yields were lower and average seed sizes were smaller in 1988 than in 1989 and 1990. The β-glucan content of the present experimental varieties was increased by high mean temperature in the growing period and low soil pH. The mean temperature of the growing period (x 1) and soil pH (x 2) explained 64% of the variation in the β-glucan content (y) of Puhti (y = 0.164.x 1 -0.212.x 2 + 2.535) and 69% of the variation in the β-glucan content of Veli (y =0.197. x 1 - 0.192. x 2+ 1.632) as calculated by multiple step-wise regression analysis. A high temperature in the growing period and low soil pH increased the β-glucan content of oats. The statistical models were significant for both varieties.

Weed species with protected growing points were tolerant to flames, whereas species with sensitive leaves and exposed growing points were susceptible. Temperatures in the flame were measured 1 cm above the ground in a rail track in the laboratory with the same burner angles and speed that were used in the field. The temperature‐time curves were analysed for maximum temperatures as well as the period of time and temperature sum above certain temperatures. There were significant differences in temperature between different burner angles but no significant relationships between the different thermal parameters obtained in the laboratory and the weed control in the field.

Detailed and densely sampled soil electrical conductivity (EC) data with a distinct border between two different regions was used for dividing the field into two zones. Averages from these zones gave better prediction for most variables than interpolation without respect to the border. With the border taken into account, cokriging with EC as a covariable improved the prediction, whereas the improvement with ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting (IDW) was insignificant. Direct interpretation of EC by a simple linear regression model gave reasonable predictions for clay content.

The present study attempts to give an overview of previous work and to identify the areas having most potential for future improvement. The study is based on 165 publications from 1771 to 2001 and covers the main parameters in relation to energy requirement, wear, ploughing result and crop yield. The study concludes that the features of greatest future potential are changes of the ploughing depth and of the shape and surface characteristics of shares and other lower plough body parts. The effects of ploughing depth have been studied in numerous investigations. The results show that the depth should be chosen with regard to soil type and weed infestation. It may often be reduced to 18-20 cm or less without significant reduction of crop yields, but with a considerable reduction of energy demand. The share tips and other lower plough body parts contribute about two thirds of the total draft requirement of the plough bodies, and they may contribute to some extent to plough pan formation. Therefore, the shapes of these parts considerably influence energy requirement, wear and maintenance costs and the resistance to root penetration and water infiltration below the plough layer. Reduction of the draft force requirement by reducing the ploughing depth and improving the shape opens up possibilities for decreases in tractor power and weight, or an increase in work rate through greater working speed or width.",

Its potential for use in agriculture is therefore of interest. Algal fibre waste from a large alginate extraction plant in Norway was studied with respect to its potential both for soil physical amelioration and as a nutrient source for potatoes. The material contained perlite, itself a wellknown growth substrate, as this was used to filter the fibre in the factory. The effects on soil moisture retention and aeration properties of incorporating up to 80% fibre waste or pure perlite were studied on five widely contrasting soil types. The algal fibre waste had similar effects to pure perlite on soil aeration and on the proportion of water held at low soil moisture tension. It had, however, a far greater effect on moisture retention at higher tension levels. Plant-available water increased by 3.6 vol.% when 10% by volume of fibre was incorporated, as against 1.2 vol.% with the same volume of pure perlite. The effects were similar in all soils. The effect on potato growth and quality of spreading 20 or 40 Mg ha -1 of algal fibre was studied by comparison with the use of various amounts of compound nitrogen- phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizer. The algal fibre contained large amounts of plant nutrients. In the absence of fertilizer, potato yield increased by 30% and 70% with the use of 20 and 40 Mg ha -1 , respectively. These increases declined to 7% and 17% at the highest rate of fertilizer application (120 kg N, 55 kg P and 187 kg K ha -1 ). The effect of 10 Mg ha -1 algal fibre was equivalent to that of 20-25 kg N in compound fertilizer. Algal fibre had little effect on soil contents of available P, K, calcium and magnesium, but the level of sodium rose sharply. Electrical conductivity did not, however, rise excessively. A considerable amount of mineral N remained in the soil after harvest, but most was lost to leaching before the following year's ryegrass crop could make use of it.",

The levels of the Fusarium toxins deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyl-DON, 15-acetyl-DON, nivalenol (NIV), fusarenon-X (4-acetyl-NIV), T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, 4,5-diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), 1,5-monoacetoxyscirpenol (MAS) and scirpentriol in the grain were determined by gas chromatography with mass-selective detection (GC-MS). DON was most often detected in the wheat and rye samples and NIV in the barley samples. The concentrations found were lower than those causing acute or chronic toxic effects in livestock or humans. No fusarenon-X or 15-acetyl-DON was detected, and only small amounts of other trichothecenes were present. Climatic conditions in Lithuania in the summer of 1998 were slightly cooler and wetter than the average for the 1992-1996 but were close to the norm. Because the samples analysed were representative of grain produced for the market in seasons with normal weather, trichothecene contamination of grain from large family farms and partnerships would not be expected to be a problem in most years.

Large variations between years and between districts regarding the start, top and end of the season were found. The difference in season was about 1 month between the earliest and latest districts of Norway. A cubic equation was fitted to accumulated yield as related to time. The start and top of season were negatively correlated to May and June temperatures: 1°;C higher June mean temperature gave 4.1 days' earlier season.

    "abstract": "Genetically modified (GM) crops have been widely adopted by American farmers. Mainly two traits, herbicide resistance and insect resistance, constitute the area of GM crops. The commercial success of these crops derives from benefits in farm management and more generally from greater efficiency in production. European population surveys continue to show widespread opposition to GM crops and other applications of gene technology in food production. Danish focus group interviews reveal general concerns that seem to form the basis for the negative perception of GM crops. The aim of the paper is to explain why American farmers and European citizens adopt opposing attitudes to GM crops. It is argued that there is a clear conflict of interest between the two groups. At present GM crops provide no genuine benefits to the consumer, who is therefore unwilling to run even very small risks arising from the use of gene technology in food production. European citizens also connect GM crops with intensive agricultural practices, which are perceived as unsustainable. Here values may diverge, but discussion about sustainable agriculture is not primarily about GM crops: it is much broader.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic crops that are genetically modified to produce insecticidal proteins from the common bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) can help to control pests while reducing reliance on insecticide sprays. So far, no insects have evolved resistance in the field to Bt transgenic crops. However, diamondback moth populations have evolved resistance to Bt sprays in the field and many pests have evolved resistance to Bt toxins in the laboratory. To delay resistance, the refuge strategy provides host plants that do not produce Bt toxins, thereby promoting survival of susceptible pests. In Arizona, Bt cotton has been extremely effective in controlling the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella), a major pest. Despite a surprisingly high frequency of resistance in 1997, resistance did not increase in Arizona field populations of pink bollworm from 1997 to 1999. Nonetheless, pink bollworm and other insects will eventually evolve resistance, so any particular transgenic crop variety is not a permanent solution to pest problems. Instead, transgenic crops can be used in harmony with other tactics as part of integrated pest management. Evaluations of transgenic crops should consider their advantages and disadvantages compared with alternatives. If transgenic crops can greatly reduce use of hazardous insecticides, as achieved in Arizona cotton, great benefits may occur.",

To reveal possible fungal infections, aborted and sound fruits of two cultivars (cv. Van for three years and cv. Lapins for two years) were harvested over four to seven weeks in an experimental orchard during the green fruit phase and incubated at 20°C in moisture saturated air for 7 days. The most frequently observed fungal pathogens were Monilinia laxa, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and Botrytis cinerea. The mean of all observations (±standard deviation) over three years, showed that aborted and sound fruits had a disease incidence of 51.9% (±31.8) and 5.2% (±9.7), respectively, after seven days incubation. In 24 of 25 trials aborted fruits had significantly higher disease incidence than sound fruits after incubation. In one season, when fruits were collected from two commercial orchards, aborted fruits had much higher disease incidence than sound fruits (a mean of 6.5 and 4.5 times higher incidence for the two orchards, respectively). Time of fruit abortion varied with the years (two years observation) and the two cultivars, but the major abortion took place between the fourth and eighth week after anthesis. A higher disease incidence and more rapid disease development in non-abscised aborted fruits indicate that they are more vulnerable to fungal colonisation than sound fruits and may thus be potential incoulum sources for neighbouring, healthy fruits.",

    "abstract": "Field experiments were carried out on three representative soils, to evaluate the effect of various starter fertilizers, together with different rates of band placed phosphorus (P), on nutrient uptake and yield of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The starter fertilizers were placed in the immediate vicinity of the seed, while the band placed P was placed at about 5 cm below the seeds and spaced at 25 cm between alternate seed rows. As starter fertilizer, monoammonium phosphate (MAP), calcium nitrate (CAN), ammonium nitrate (AN) and triple superphosphate (P20) were compared. In both species, effects of starter fertilizer on P uptake were most marked early in the growing season. At GS 13 application of 20 kg P ha−1 as MAP increased the P uptake by 50% in barley and by 35% in wheat, compared to no seed-placed nutrients. For grain, the increase in P content was 8% for both species. The higher P uptake at GS 13 was supported by observations of higher plant vigour in the treatments with either P20 or MAP as starter fertilizer. The use of N only as starter fertilizer did not increase the vigour of the plants. Band placement of P also gave more vigorous plants in spring barley. The grain yield increased on the silty clay loam and on the silt soil when starter fertilizer was applied, especially with the use of MAP. Smaller and non-significant yield differences were found when starter fertilizer was used on the loam soil. No delay or reduction of emergence was observed with starter fertilizer. Therefore, on soils where root growth or nutrient uptake becomes limited during the first weeks after sowing, application of starter fertilizer is recommended in Norway for both spring barley and spring wheat. Crops grown on silty soils seem to have an especially high demand for easily available P given as starter fertilizer.",

A three-year study (2001–2003) was conducted to investigate the effects of three tillage systems on planting performance, aggregate properties, and crop yield of a loam soil (typic Xerofluvent) with a rotation system (sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-Hungarian vetch (Vicia pannonica Crantz) and triticale. Tillage treatments were chisel ploughing, chisel ploughing and disc harrowing, and chisel ploughing and combine harrowing. Planting performance was determined only for sunflower. The emergence percentage of seeds sown, the percentage of plants which have an acceptable seedling interval, the percentage of gaps, and the percentage of double seedlings were used as the characteristics of planting performance. The highest percentage of gaps was in the chisel ploughing treatment, and the highest percentage of double seedlings was in the chisel ploughing and combine harrowing treatment. The percentage of gaps was reduced, and the percentage of double seedlings was increased by secondary tillage operations. Soil samples were taken from 0–20 cm depth at four different periods of the experiment. A wet-sieving method was used to determine aggregate size distribution and mean weight diameter as indices of soil aggregate stability. The percentage of water-stable aggregates for the three tillage systems was not significantly different in all size classes. Data showed significant differences among the effects of time on water-stable aggregates and. The distribution of water-stable aggregates revealed that chisel ploughing and combine harrowing treatment caused an increase in the susceptibility of macroaggregates. While there was no difference among treatments for sunflower yield, barley and Hungarian vetch and triticale yields were lower in the chisel ploughing treatment. It is not recommended to dispense with secondary tillage operations in dry conditions, owing to the limited changes in aggregation among tillage systems and higher Hungarian vetch and triticale yields.",

Open-top chambers were used for ambient and elevated (+350 μmol mol−1) concentrations of CO2, and chamberless rings were used for control. Root dynamics were observed in situ with minirhizotrons during the five summers and root biomass production was measured with root in growth cores during the last two years, from which total root biomass was estimated for each of the five years. The elevated CO2 treatment showed both a greater increase in root numbers during the early summer and a greater decline in root numbers during autumn and winter than the ambient CO2 treatment. Mean root production under elevated CO2 was 50% greater than ambient CO2 during the five years, and the difference increased from +25% in the first year to +80% in the last two years. Conversely, during the same period, the elevated to ambient CO2 difference in shoot biomass decreased from +50% to +5%. This resulted in a dramatic change in root to shoot ratios in elevated CO2 compared with the ambient treatment, which increased from −15% in 1996 to +70% in 2000. Similar differences were seen between elevated CO2 and the chamberless grown control plants, where root to shoot ratios increased steadily from −47% in 1996 to +27% in 2000. Less dynamically, the root to shoot ratios of ambient CO2 grown plants compared with the chamberless control plants were consistently −29%±6% during the experimental period. In conclusion, during the 5 years this grassland was studied, there was a clear shift in plant biomass partitioning from above to below ground for plants exposed to elevated CO2.",

When the combined effect of the various GM contamination stages is calculated, the worst-case predictions of the different stages are normally added. This additive procedure to estimate the combined effect of GM contamination may be relevant to estimate the combined effect where a single farm is concerned, but may result in estimation errors when harvested seeds from a large number of farms are mixed. In this study, the consequences of treating the different stages of GM contamination as independent stochastic effects on the combined GM contamination have been estimated. A case study of GM contamination in organic and conventional oilseed rape crops under Danish conditions indicated that the greater part of GM contamination occurred at farm level and much less during transport and storage. Generally, it may be concluded that it is important to consider this uncertainty in the estimates of adventitious presence at each seed production step and also whether the different steps are independent.",

Significant differences in amino acid composition were found, between both cultivars and localities. These differences were correlated to varying grain protein content, to a greater extent than to other cultivar properties or trial localization (latitude). Cultivars with high grain protein content generally had less favourable amino acid composition than did cultivars with low protein content. For early-maturing cultivars, ‘Olsok’ showed the most favourable amino acid composition and ‘Vilde’ the least favourable. For late-maturing cultivars, ‘Annabell’ had the most favourable amino acid composition, and the naked cultivar ‘Netto’ the least favourable. Localities representing trials with low mean protein content showed more favourable amino acid composition than did localities representing trials with high mean protein content. The protein content showed a positive correlation to fertilization (r 2=0.37), precipitation in June (r 2=0.70), and temperature in May (r 2=0.23). Other parameters were only weakly, or not at all, correlated to protein content.",

The objectives of this study were to document amounts of and variations in SNF under farming conditions in Finland, and to explore their determinants. SNF in perennial red clover–grass leys not amended with mineral N fertilizers was studied on 27 organic farms located in the southern and the north-western coastal regions of Finland. Ley growth subsequent to the harvest of the nurse crop fixed 38.6 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (SD = 25.2 kg N ha−1 yr−1). SNF in the accumulated first and second cuts of one- and two-year-old leys averaged 185.4 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (SD = 90.0 kg N ha−1 yr−1); fixation in the aftermath added 62.1 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (SD = 49.8 kg N ha−1 yr−1). SNF significantly increased from the first to the second cut. Owing to the poor persistence of clover, SNF declined with ley age. Between- and within-field coefficients of variation of SNF in one- and two-year-old leys averaged 51.1 and 51.8%, respectively, and increased with ley age. Variation of SNF within one- and two-year-old leys was significantly negatively related to amount of SNF on field level. SNF was significantly positively related to soil fertility parameters. Amounts of SNF were lower and between- and within-field variations of SNF were higher in the north-western as compared with the southern region. This difference was largely related to soil properties although the role of climate cannot be discarded. High between- and within-field variabilities of SNF suggest a need for amending within-field differences in soil fertility.",

Pre-sprouting treatments of all varieties and thermal shock treatment of the variety Agrie Dzeltenie had a significant effect on the leaf area index. The value and timing of maximum leaf area index were: variety specific, 4.0 units of the early variety Agrie Dzeltenie, 3.7 units of the middle-maturing variety Piret and 3.9 units of the late variety Ants. The weight of the haulms of the plants developed from physiologically older seed tubers formed faster and remained smaller. Pre-planting treatment of seed tubers provided quicker field emergence. The slower the potato plants developed the haulms, the greater the maximum weight achieved. Pre-planting treatments influence the leaf area index. The importance of this influence lies in potato varieties with different maturity times since increases in quality and yield depend on the size of the photosynthetic area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil aggregate stability is a crucial property regarding soil erodibility. However, results from different stability-assessment methods differ. The objective of this study was to compare two such methods on a set of southeast Norwegian agricultural soils. Traditionally, a raindrop-impact method has been used to determine the soil aggregate stability of Norwegian soils. Here, a more common, less destructive method was also used, a wet-sieve method using one sieve. Two soil fractions were studied, aggregates of 0.6–2 mm and 2–6 mm in diameter. The soil samples were chosen to give a wide range in clay content (5.7–68.0%) and soil organic matter (1.7–8.5% SOM). Using the wet-sieve method two different pre-treatments were performed; either using air-dried aggregates or slowly pre-wetted, air-dried aggregates. The aggregate stability found using the wet-sieve method gave generally higher stability values for soil aggregates 2–6 mm in diameter than using the standard raindrop-impact method (21% higher on average). Soils with high contents of silt and very fine sand (0.002–0.2 mm), however, were found to be more susceptible to destruction due to raindrop impact than to wet-sieving. Hence, using the wet-sieve method, the silty soils were ranked as more stable than by using the standard raindrop-impact method. Aggregate stability was positively correlated with the SOM and Al-oxides content and negatively correlated with the silt and the very fine sand content (0.002–0.02 mm). Using slowly, pre-wetted air-dried aggregates, which induce rebonding and reduce the effect of slaking, resulted in distinctively higher stability values than using air-dried aggregates in the wet-sieving method (34% higher on average). The wet-sieve method is less laborious and more widely used elsewhere, but the lower disruptive effect on silty soils should be kept in mind when using this method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Turfgrasses are continuously exposed to a wide range of detrimental stresses, such as mowing, traffic, low or high temperatures, salinity, drought, UV, hypoxia etc. Plant responses to stimuli involve nearly every aspect of plant physiology and metabolism. Carbohydrates, primary sucrose and starch, as principal metabolic products of photosynthesis, are stored in bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) in stolons and rhizomes. Total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) levels have been used as indicators of health and physiological status in bermudagrass. TNC levels vary during the year and are weakly affected by N source. Establishment is a critical phase of bermudagrass management. The objectives of this research were to assess and characterize stolon carbohydrate content in nine bermudagrass cultivars during the full establishment phase in relation to establishment rates. Morphological and growth analyses showed distinct properties among the cultivars selected for this study. Significant differences in turf coverage among cultivars on each rating date were present starting from early growth stages. Carbohydrates localization was used to differentiate bermudagrass cultivars. The relationships between different carbohydrates and their role on growth were also explored. Gradients along the stolon from tip to older internodes were evident for starch. Our study provides further insight into bermudagrass physiology, with cultivar differences in carbohydrates production and localization providing valuable selection information for turfgrass breeders and practitioners, especially during the first year. Our data indicate that TNC levels were affected by cultivar and stolon maturity level. TNC content was found to correlate with establishment rate.",

Treatment effect on turfgrass quality was also determined. Over two years of trials, phosphite treated plots, when compared with untreated controls, exhibited significantly lower percentages (p<0.01) of M. nivale incidence. The addition of the biostimulant did not enhance this effect. The iprodione treatments showed significantly higher suppression than the phosphite treatments (p<0.01), and the addition of phosphite significantly enhanced the fungicide control of M. nivale (p<0.01). This last combined treatment was most effective overall, with full inhibition on the treated plots. Turfgrass quality on all phosphite treated plots was significantly better (p<0.01) than either the control or iprodione treated plots.",

Four wheat genotypes; Kharchia-65, SARC-3, S-9476, and S-8189 were grown under salt stress (75 and 150 mM NaCl) in nutrient solution with five replications. Shoot dry weight, relative growth rate (RGR), chlorophyll index, leaf water relations, Na+ content, and transport in plants were measured. The increase in NaCl stress decreased all growth parameters; however, variations were observed among genotypes. Kharchia-65, S-9476, and SARC-3 had better growth and water relations compared with the salt-sensitive genotype S-8189. The low rate of Na+ transport and better ability to restrict Na+ in the root was the main reason for genetic variation among different genotypes, especially when growth characteristics did not vary significantly under salt stress. Na+ partition was also recorded in the wheat genotypes, since salt-sensitive genotypes had higher Na+ accumulation in shoot while this was reversed in tolerant ones. The differences in root Na+ were not significant among all genotypes.",

Our aim was to study the fungal communities associated with field grown oilseed rape and to explore their role in emergence and early crop establishment. This study was carried out by characterising the fungal communities in roots and rhizosphere soils of both spring and winter oilseed rape. The fungal communities were analysed using both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Sampling was carried out in field plots with clear differences in crop establishment. Phylogenetic comparison of the fungal communities in different environments revealed significant differences between roots and rhizosphere soils. In winter rape, the fungal communities in the poor-emergence plots differed significantly from that found in normal-emergence plots, while in spring rape this difference was less prominent. However, in a combined statistical analysis of data from both winter and spring rape, the fungal communities in poor- and normal-emergence plots differed significantly. In follow-up studies, putatively pathogenic fungi were isolated from poor-emergence plots. Their effects on emergence and seedling growth were evaluated in the two crop types in greenhouse experiments. Rhizoctonia solani was found only in roots from poor-emergence plots, and was also demonstrated to be highly pathogenic on oilseed rape independent of cultivars when tested in greenhouse trials. The results from the fungal community analysis and from the greenhouse experiments are discussed in relation to their role in crop establishment related problems in oilseed rape.",

We previously optimised a model for the prediction of metal solubility and free metal ion concentrations in soil solution from sites collected in the Danube basin of Eastern Croatia, containing total metal concentration (concentrated HNO3), soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as model parameters. In the present study, we report how our optimised models correlate with metal concentration in plants reported by Lončarić et al., which was based on a study from a smaller part of the same sampling area. Our default regression model and further optimised model predicted metal solubility and free metal ion concentrations. These predictions correlated well with Fe, Mn, Zn and Cd concentrations in wheat grain, but the different extraction methods and parameter optimisations affected the significance of correlations differently. Due to the low concentrations of total metal concentrations in soil and little variation in SOM, the soil pH was the only variable, in addition to the total metal controlling the metal solubility, free metal ion in soil water and also the concentrations in wheat grain. Results show that after optimisation for the few most important soil chemical variables regression models can predict metal concentrations in plants fairly well. For this particular study, optimisation for total metal, soil pH and perhaps also SOM and DOC are sufficient.",

For increasing food safety, monitoring programmes are taking place in each European Union Member State and in Norway and Iceland every year. The monitoring aims to detect samples from food exceeding the maximum residue level (MRL) and provides data for an assessment of consumer exposure to pesticide residues. Results from Estonian national monitoring programme conducted by Veterinary and Food Board are presented in this paper, used to find out the differences in pesticide residue occurrences and MRL exceedances in local and imported food consumed in Estonia. In 2008, residues of one or more pesticides were found in 35–53% of the total analysed samples of fruits, vegetables and cereals. Imported food contained more pesticide residues compared to local food. MRLs were exceeded by 1.6% in 2008 and 2.3% in 2009 out of all samples, residues exceeding the MRLs were found in imported samples only. In 2010, 2.1% of total samples were above MRL. In 2011, 0.7% of total samples exceeded MRL which were of domestic origin. The highest MRL exceedances from the years 2008 to 2011 were propargite in beans with pods from Estonia over 10 times, chlormequat in grapes from India 7.9 times and trifluralin in tea from China 7.5 times. MRL was most frequently exceeded by dithiocarbamates, in 12 cases out of 22. The highest number of different pesticide residues in a single sample was 10 in apple from Belgium, 9 in mandarin from South Africa, 8 in strawberries from Spain and in apple from Poland. The results of monitoring programme show that local food contains less pesticide residues than imported food. By consuming food locally, it is possible to reduce the consumption of pesticide residues.",

The primary indicator for success in GLT system is that potent nematicidal chemicals be released through leaching by water, while in conventional organic amendments potent chemicals are released through microbial degradation. Due to widespread availability of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) leaves in local markets as a waste, the material would be readily available for use in GLT systems in peri-urban agriculture. The objective of the study was to determine whether crude extracts of B. oleracea leaves were suitable for use in GLT system for managing the root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) nematodes and improving growth of tomato (Solanum lycorpersicum). A 2×2×2 factorial experiment, with the main factors being Bacillus species, crude extracts of B. oleracea leaves and Meloidogyne incognita, was conducted over two seasons under microplot conditions. At harvest, Bacillus×Brassica×nematode interaction reduced final nematode population densities, fresh fruit yield, dry shoot mass, plant height and stem diameter, while Bacillus× Brassica interaction increased tomato growth variables. Incidentally, Brassica alone reduced the productivity of tomato. Overall, the efficacy of crude extracts of B. oleracea leaves in nematode suppression and tomato productivity was dependent upon microbial activities and therefore, the material was not suitable for use in GLT systems.",

The main aim was to determine the effect of various sulphur (S) fertilization strategies at two different nitrogen (N) levels on grain yield and quality of winter wheat. With the exception of four trials in central Norway, all the trials were located in the south-eastern part of the country. Increasing the N fertilization from 170 to 210 kg N ha−1 resulted in significantly higher grain protein content (GPC) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sedimentation volume. On clayey soils in southeast Norway, increased N-fertilization also resulted in higher grain yield and lower test weight and thousand grain weight (tgw). Omitting S fertilization significantly reduced grain yields on sandy soils in southeast Norway and on loam and silt loam in central Norway, whereas no yield reduction was found on clay soils. SDS sedimentation volume and specific SDS (sSDS = SDS/GPC) were significantly reduced when S-fertilization was omitted. GPC was reduced by S fertilization in central Norway. Generally there were no significant responses at application rates higher than 12 kg S ha−1. The malate:sulphate method is a field-based diagnostic test used to determine whether S deficiency is likely to occur. The results did not indicate that this test is reliable under Norwegian conditions. On the other hand, the use of a chlorophyll meter measurements to assess S status gave promising results.",

Increased N rate significantly affected cotton leaf photosynthetic rate, leaf area index, N concentrations of leaves and fruit, plant N uptake, and N-use efficiency, but had less effect on N partitioning among the plant tissues. Lint-yield response to N rate depended on soil N level and experimental year. Cotton plant shoot N concentration and N uptake significantly and linearly correlated with the selected ratios (R 715/R 405, r 2=0.65*** and R 795/R 755, r 2=0.70***, respectively) of canopy reflectance measured during the squaring and fruiting of plant development. Proper management of N application in cotton based on soil N analysis and plant N status could improve cotton N-use efficiency and lint yield. Remote-sensing algorithms, developed from canopy reflectance ratios in this study, may be used to estimate N concentration in cotton shoots and plant N uptake and help producers make cotton N-management decisions during the growing season.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Limited information is available for understanding factors controlled dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) affected by long-term conventional cultivation in seasonally frozen soils. A 19-year observation in this study was conducted in north-eastern China to evaluate effects and relative importance of potential factors. SOC variation extent was greater relative to global average as per unit of annual mean air temperature and precipitation changed. Increased carbon sequestration was observed in meadow lessive, while slight to moderate declines occurred in meadow-boggy soil and meadow soil. However, no differences in TN were found across soil types. At sites with low slope, carbon and nitrogen sequestration increased, largely due to water movement. Increased biomass with introducing 1-year oilseed rape/fallow in crop rotations could promote SOC and TN accumulation in the long run. Planting proportion of crops could also regulate carbon and nitrogen levels at a farm scale; the optimal ratio was observed in the range of 0.8–1.4. High crop yield was associated with lower carbon and nitrogen levels, and nutrient thresholds of yielding increment were observed as 25.7 g kg−1 for carbon and 2.6 g kg−1 for nitrogen. The length of frost-free period or cultivation period could not help sequestrating carbon and nitrogen. Chemical fertilizer with crop residues provoked SOC and TN increments compared with no chemical fertilizer plus little organic manure. Different factors exerted different tendentious influences, leading to subtle differences in SOC and TN variation rates. Accordingly, optimal cultivation strategies could be developed to reduce nutrient losses and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.",

Although wild vegetables usually grow as weeds alongside crops such as maize during the planting season, a renewed interest by researchers has led to efforts to domesticate these plants due to their favourable nutritional qualities, for food and to preserve their knowledge. Solanum nigrum is a popular wild vegetable consumed by the rural populace of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and was selected for domestication. A field trial was conducted at the University of Fort Hare research farm located at 32°47′3″S, 26°50′43″E from September to December 2012 to investigate the effect of goat manure and inorganic fertiliser on the growth and physiological response of S. nigrum with a view to determine the best fertiliser option for successful cultivation. Five treatments (control, 100 kg N/ha, 8.13 t manure/ha, 100 kg N/ha + 8.13 t manure/ha and 50 kg N/ha + 4.07 t manure/ha) were arranged in plots in a randomised complete block design with five replicates. Plant height, total number of leaves formed, chlorophyll content, moisture content, root:shoot ratio, leaf area and stem diameter were measured using standard plant growth measurement methods. Application of 100 kg N/ha + 8.13 t manure/ha produced the highest plant height, total number of leaves and chlorophyll values. Applying 100 kg N/ha produced the highest moisture content, root:shoot ratio and stem diameter. Organic fertiliser alone did not have a positive effect on the growth parameters. Therefore, the application of 100 kg N/ha + 8.13 t manure/ha is recommended for the cultivation of S. nigrum in the Eastern Cape for optimum results.",

Allelopathy is one of the main continuous cropping obstacles and is the foundation for after-crop selection in crop rotation. In this study, lily root exudates were acquired at three stages (10, 20, and 30 days) after hydroponic culture of lily bulbs, and the allelopathy of four vegetable crops was tested by bioassay. The results indicated that the allelopathy intensity of lily root exudates on radish increased with increasing duration of hydroponic culture, and the lily root exudates that were collected after 30 days of hydroponic culture exhibited the strongest allelopathic effects. The allelopathy on tomato, cucumber, and lettuce was complex. The weakest allelopathy on tomato and cucumber, but the strongest allelopathy on lettuce, was exhibited by lily root exudates that were collected after 20 days of hydroponic culture. Furthermore, differences in seed germination response and shoot and root growth patterns of the same root exudates were observed. Comparably, radish was the most sensitive receptor to the allelopathy of lily root exudates that were collected at different stages, and lettuce appeared to be the least sensitive of the tested receptors based upon the studied indices. It is inferred that lettuce and cucumber are suitable after-crops for lily, while radish is the most rational receptor for further bioassay tests on the allelopathy of lily root exudates.",

    "abstract": "Erodibility of Swedish clay soils estimated according to the existing methods is usually low, but high levels of suspended solids and attached unreactive phosphorus have been recorded in drainage water from fields and catchments dominated by clay soils. Inherent susceptibility to soil erosion is usually assessed through aggregate stability studies or dispersion tests. The latter are simple to perform and produce good results when compared against runoff lysimeter experiments. The environmental soil test to determine the potential for sediment and phosphorus transfer in runoff from agricultural land (DESPRAL) and soil suspension turbidity (SST) dispersion tests, which differ in soil–liquid ratio and shaking and settling times, were compared here for their ability to indicate the erodibility of 10 Swedish clay soils. The tests proved to be significantly correlated (r=0.78), but DESPRAL showed higher repeatability (r i =0.995) than SST (r i =0.824). Variation in soil dispersion was explained by clay, sand and organic matter content in DESPRAL and by clay and sand content in SST. An additional study on the effect of soil storage duration on dispersion (DESPRAL test) in 15 soil samples showed that storage had no effect on some soils, but significantly decreased dispersion in others after only 8 weeks. Therefore, soil dispersion tests should be performed as soon as possible after sample drying. The DESPRAL and SST tests proved to be a good option for estimating the erodibility factor K in the Revised Universal Soil Loss equation under Swedish conditions and were able to differentiate the susceptibility to sediment losses for different clay soils. They provided an indirect measure of the amounts of sediment and P mobilized, but further work is needed to calibrate them against measured values at field and catchment scale.",

    "abstract": "The effect of returning turfgrass clippings on mown turf, in terms of the value of clippings as a nitrogen source as well as management interactions on grass growth, has not been well examined. The objective of the present research was to study the impact of N rate and weather during the growing season on the effect of returned clippings and on efficiency of returned clippings. The experiment was carried out between 2004 and 2008. Over a five-year period, a field experiment was conducted on a sward of Festuca rubra rubra and Poa pratensis. Measured experimental factors included two clipping treatments, with clippings removed or clippings returned, as well as seven fertilizer rates.The swards' dry matter yield was significantly influenced by clippings treatment, applied N rate, year, and these interactions. Returning turfgrass clippings provide significant positive effects on the dry matter yield only when plants are fertilized with N. Without N fertilization, the effect was negative or absent. Returned clippings impact (RCLI) increased with N rate up to 213 kg N ha−1 and then started to decrease. The annual effect of returned clippings at N level 240 kg ha−1 depended mainly on the amount of returned clippings in May and June, as well as on precipitation during May. The annual efficiency of returned clippings at the same N level was mostly associated with precipitation in May and June and the average temperatures in July. We conclude that the annual effect of returning grass clippings on mown turf is beneficial only with mineral fertilizer. Also, if the moisture condition is a limiting factor to the decomposition of clippings then the moisture conditions must be improved with the irrigation.",

Two methods for estimating diffusivity of stony soils, using cumulative infiltration, wetting front and soil water content distribution, respectively, were compared to evaluate their applicability. Also, estimating method of Brooks–Corey water retention curve for stony soils, using cumulative infiltration and wetting front, was evaluated based on the measured retention curve. The results showed that both rock fragment content and grain size had significant effects on infiltration properties and hydraulic parameters of stony-soil media. Both cumulative infiltration and wetting front distance of stony-soil media were smaller than those of fine soil since rock fragment hindered infiltration. The more rock fragment content, the slower soil water moved, but the turning point appeared at the rock fragment content of 40%. Besides, larger rock fragment grain size accelerated infiltration at certain content. Both rock fragment content and grain size had significant influences on hydraulic parameters, and there were linear relationships between parameters and rock fragment content. Two kinds of methods for estimating diffusivity of stony soils had a very good consistency for some experimental scenarios. Besides, cumulative infiltration and wetting front could be used to accurately estimate water retention curve of stony soils.",

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a perennial grass that is adaptable to a wide range of environments, has recently been introduced to China's Loess Plateau as a forage and as a biofuel source. In this study, we assayed the allelopathic potential of root exudates from 11 switchgrass cultivars (Alamo, Blackwell, Cave-in-Rock, Dakota, Forestberg, Illinois USA, Kanlow, Nebraska 28, Pathfinder, Sunburst, and Unnamed) on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) germination and seedling growth. The root exudates were applied to lettuce seeds at three concentrations (1, 10, or 100 mg L−1). Germination percentage (Gp), germination speed (Gs), and allelopathic response index (RI) were calculated to compare the effects of the switchgrass cultivars. The results indicated that lettuce germination and seedling growth generally decreased as the concentration of root exudates increased. Root exudates of Forestberg generally reduced lettuce seedling growth, regardless of the concentration at which the exudates were applied. In contrast, depending on their concentration, root exudates of Nebraska 28 either had no significant effect or increased germination speed and lettuce seedling growth. Cluster analysis showed that Nebraska 28 and Forestberg had the highest allelopathic potential among the switchgrass cultivars. The allelopathic potential of Alamo and Kanlow were similar, suggesting that allelopathic potential is related to ecotype. These results provide important information for additional studies about allelopathic potential of switchgrass and about interactions between switchgrass and neighboring plants.",

To explore the optimal soil mulching options for the Loess Plateau in China, a 3-year field study was conducted to investigate the effects of various soil mulching practices on soil temperature and the water use and grain yield of spring maize. The treatments included traditional flat farming (CK), narrow plastic film mulch (NM), wide plastic film mulch (WM) and narrow plastic film mulch + maize straw mulch between rows (MS). The results showed that MS treatment increased consistently soil temperature during the initial stages of maize growth, and more importantly, it reduced diurnal temperature variation. MS also increased in soil water storage by 10.1%, leading to the highest water use efficiency (WUE = 30.9 kg ha−1 mm−1) over CK on 3 year average. MS significantly increased maize yield and net income of farmers by up to 20%, compared to CK. In conclusion, optimisation of soil mulching strategies significantly enhanced crop yield and water productivity in dryland agriculture in China. Our study provides important guidance for exploring better soil management practice for dryland agriculture in the other regions of the world.",

For the example given here controlling susceptibility of seeds to disease was the most effective method. As controlling diseases can be costly, optimal methods are important.

    "abstract": "Spatial variations in yield occur in all agricultural fields to some degree. Knowledge of the reasons for these variations, especially temporally stable yield patterns, is needed in order to improve productivity by changing production methods or inputs. This information must be provided in a simple, cost-effective way. This study investigated whether field-scale measurements of penetration resistance (PR) could identify temporally stable yield patterns without complementary measurements of other properties. The PR measurements were also compared with field-scale apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements and correlations between yield and PR and yield and ECa were investigated. Measurements with a newly constructed horizontal penetrometer and a non-invasive proximal electromagnetic induction sensor were carried out in three fields in east-central Sweden. The measurements were made once in each field, apart from one field where PR was measured twice in one season. The sensor measurements were compared with crop yield measured over the course of several years. The horizontal penetrometer was able to identify low-yielding areas in one field. However, single measurements of PR or ECa were insufficient to consistently identify yield variations. Parts of the fields showed more consistent patterns, with stronger correlations between PR, ECa and yield. PR and ECa data were better at explaining yield variations in drier years, but showed diverging patterns in different fields and neither showed a much stronger correlation to yield than the other. In future studies, simultaneous measurement of soil water content is recommended and also PR measurements at a water content drier than field capacity.",

Sequencing of partial 16S rRNA gene from the DGGE bands were performed. Conventional and organic farming resulted in significant differences in chemical properties of soils. According to the results community fingerprints were separated into groups depending on soil types and farming systems. This separation can be attributed mostly to soil pH, AL-P2O5,-K2O. The analysed sequences were identified as soil bacteria which could play the main role in nitrogen fixing, mineralisation and denitrification. The highest diversity index was revealed from the organic farming at sandy texture site, where mainly Mesorhizobium sp. and Rhizobium sp. were detected.

The paper further presents the results showing how a change in establishment time from autumn to spring influences the germination rate of four important annual grasses. The study demonstrated that springtime establishment offers the opportunity to reduce problems with Apera spica-venti and Poa trivialis and to a lesser extent with Alopecurus myosuroides and Vulpia myuros. The study further showed that the false seedbed technique can be a very effective tool to reduce problems with annual grasses. The populations of two of the investigated species, P. trivialis and V. myuros, were reduced by almost 80% applying the false seedbed technique.

In particular, excessive nitrogen application has been associated with biodiversity loss. Many studies have shown the potential to reduce the use of nitrogen without any impact on crop yield. Maintaining crop yield has been the goal, whereas crop quality has not been considered. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the level of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen fertiliser application on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) yield and its quality. We show that the absence of nitrogen fertiliser decreased both yield and quality parameters of cereal grain. Quality parameters, such as protein and gluten contents, zeleny value, falling number and hardness were strongly positively influenced by nitrogen fertiliser application. The SOC level had no significant effect on these grain quality parameters. As a result, in the absence of nitrogen fertiliser, grain was not suitable for baking bread. We recommend that in the debate on the potential to limit the use of nitrogen in agricultural production, its impact on grain quality should be taken into consideration, especially at low levels of SOC.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the productivity and nutrients concentrations of out-of-season corn and Congo-grass intercropped in the no-tillage system, as a function of the nitrogen rates applied in sidedressing. The treatments were four nitrogen rates, 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg ha−1. The experimental design was randomised complete blocks with four replicates. The experimental period corresponded to the harvests of 2015 and 2016. There were evaluated: corn grain yield, dry mass production and nutrient concentration in the shoots of the plants intercropped. The evaluations were carried out at the physiological maturity stage of the corn and at the time of desiccation of the grass. Nitrogen increased grain yield and dry mass production of the plants intercropped. Nitrogen maximised the magnesium concentration in out-of-season corn and the nitrogen, calcium, magnesium and sulphur concentrations in Congo grass. Excess nitrogen promoted reduction of the phosphorus in the Corn-Congo grass intercropping system in the dry season.",

The rotation included: legumes + spring barley, winter triticale and winter rape. The study was conducted as a two-factorial field experiment with four replications. The present study showed that legumes, as forecrops, increased the yield of WT cultivated in the second year of rotation. The seed yield of WR cultivated in the third year of rotation significantly increased after all legume forecrops, with the exception of PEA. Yielding of these crops depended also on nitrogen fertilisation. In the case of WT doses 120 kg N ha−1 and 180 kg N ha−1 there was an increased yield compared with control independent of forecrop, but there were no significant differences between doses 120 and 180 kg N ha−1. The conclusion is that we do not need to use dose 180 kg N ha−1 for WT cultivated directly after legumes. In the cultivation of WR in the third year of rotation there is no need to use a dose of nitrogen 180 kg N ha−1 if the fore-fore-crops were indeterminate cultivars of BL or YL.",

This study assessed the effects of drainage intensity on water and nitrogen use efficiency and rice grain yield in a field experiment conducted during three seasons in Rwanda. The experiment comprised 12 plots with four blocks and three treatments: DS0.6 (0.6 m deep drain), DD11.2 (1.2 m deep drain, control structure open four times per week), and DD21.2 (1.2 m deep drain, control structure open two times per week). Outflow was calculated from water balance. Nitrogen (N) content in drainage water was determined weekly. Crop yield and N uptake were determined in grain and straw.In all seasons, grain yield was 61–131% higher, crop N uptake was 24–90% higher, harvest index (HI) was 24–65% higher and water use efficiency (WUE) was 50–150% higher in treatments DD11.2 and DD21.2 than in DS0.6. There was a decrease in soil carbon/nitrogen ratio at the end of Seasons 2 and 3. Recirculating straw to fields is thus necessary to replenish SOC for long-term soil fertility. A practical implication of the study is that managed deep drainage systems could enhance water use efficiency and rice grain yield in poorly drained paddy fields.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different mulching practices on hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) performance in terms of leaf photosynthetic capacity, photosynthetic light response (PLR) curves, and growth parameters, under greenhouse conditions. Consequently, field experiments were conducted during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons in Northwest China using four types of mulching practices (without mulch; wheat straw mulch; plastic film mulch; and combined mulch with plastic film and wheat straw). The results showed that mulching increased the leaf net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance to water vapor, intercellular CO2 concentration, water-use efficiency, and transpiration rate. Mulching significantly affected the PLR curves, and important parameters (such as the apparent quantum yield, maximum net photosynthetic rate, light compensation point, and light saturation point) were all improved under combined mulching conditions when compared with other mulching practices. Therefore, it is inferred that hot pepper leaf photosynthetic capacity and light-use efficiency were significantly improved under combined mulching, and thereby the combined mulching is recommended for hot pepper cultivation in greenhouses due to working well to facilitate soil condition (moisture and temperature), plant growth, and marketable photosynthetic characteristics.",

In a paper, two methods of statistical analysis of such (ordered) data are compared.Several models have been proposed for the statistical interpretation of ordinal data. One of the most popular is the cumulative-type fixed logistic model. In the present work, using two field pea data sets, we considered whether adding random effects to the simple logistic model can improve inference. It was investigated whether there is any difference between the decisions concerning varieties resulting from the simple logistic model and the proposed mixed logistic model. The two models were also compared in terms of goodness of fit. According to two applied goodness-of-fit statistics, the mixed model performed better in all the cases. Statistical analysis (what is important for practical agriculture) enabled identification of the most resistant and the most susceptible variety from the analyzed set of cultivars.",

    "abstract": "To develop better mechanical management strategies, more information on the impact of root partitioning on changes in the population dynamics of Sonchus arvensis is needed. Therefore, the effects of root fragmentation of S. arvensis on shoot height frequency distributions, biomass production and nitrogen allocation were studied in an outdoor experiment in Sweden in 2008. Three artificial populations of S. arvensis of different initial root lengths but with the same total root length per area were planted. Shoot heights were measured at the onset of flowering and dry weight and nitrogen content of leaves, stems, buds and roots were quantified twice during the season. Height frequency distributions of the populations were bimodal, indicating the existence of two generations distinctly different in height growth pattern. Shorter root fragments produced shoots with a lower mean height compared to longer fragments. Plants originating from longer root fragments had higher dry weight and more nitrogen compared to plants from shorter root fragments. Dry matter production per square meter did not differ between the populations. The proportion of dry matter and nitrogen allocated to the different plant components (leaves, stems, buds and roots) at harvest did not differ between the populations. Over time, nitrogen was reallocated from leaves and stems to roots. Our results show that initial root length of S. arvensis per square meter, rather than the number of root fragments per square meter, is a good predictor of biomass at harvest, and that the degree of root fragmentation does not affect nitrogen allocation patterns. Root fragmentation, however, leads to a lower average canopy height for S. arvensis, and thus may be an effective weed control measure in combination with a crop which is competitive for light.",

At 80 days after sowing, SAR effects improved soil health and contributed 8% in total treatment variation (TTV) of chlorophyll and sugar contents each in sweet sorghum, with nemarioc-AL 3 and 6% phytonematicides stimulating improvement of the two variables. Nemafric-BL SAR effects had no effect on growth of sweet sorghum. In contrast, SAR effects contributed 76 and 39% in TTV of nematode population densities in root and soil, respectively. SAR effects of nemafric-BL and nemarioc-AL inhibited nematode numbers by 67–97% and 64–80%, respectively.

We studied community structure, clone libraries, and abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in soybean fields there were in continuous soybean production for up to 17 years (SC17). Results showed that the potential nitrification rate (PNR) and amoA gene abundance of soybean in continuous cultivation for seven years (SC7) was 0.34 µg NO3− g−1 and 4.71 × 10−5 amoA gene copies/g dry soil, respectively. These values were lower than other treatments. Phylogenetic affiliation analysis based on blast results of amoA gene clone sequencing showed that the sequences belonged to seven clusters: Cluster 1, Cluster 3b, Cluster 3a.1, Cluster 3a.2, Cluster 9, Cluster 10, and Cluster 4. Correlation of AOB community compositions with environmental factors was performed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Results indicated that the composition of AOB communities in maize–soybean (MS) rotation and continuous cropping of soybean for two years (SC2) were positively related to the PNR of soil, soil moisture, and soil total nitrogen content. Soybean fields continuously cropped for 11 years (SC11) and SC7 fields had AOB community compositions that were negatively related to these factors. The AOB community composition of SC17 was positively correlated to the soil total carbon content of soil. The results in this study indicate that the potential activity and abundance of AOB community in soil significantly changed after seven years continuous cropping compared to other continuous cropping intervals.

Our objective was to determine whether sowing winter rye (Secale cereale L.) or winter triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) into living Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.) improves yield or nutritive value compared to monoculture cereal crop forage in northern Europe. The experiments were conducted near Mochełek and Falęcin, Poland. In autumn 2010 and 2011, winter rye was sown into existing Caucasian clover or in monoculture at Mochełek, and winter triticale was sown into Caucasian clover or in monoculture at Falęcin, with monoculture clover as a third crop treatment at both locations. The following spring, first harvest of forage from the three crop treatments was taken at two maturities: when monoculture cereals reached heading (BBCH 51) or grain milk stage (BBCH 71), and two additional harvests were taken from mixture plots and monoculture clover before autumn. First harvest forage yields of mixtures were similar to monoculture cereal at Falęcin, less than monoculture cereal at Mochełek, and greater than monoculture clover at both locations. Full season forage yields of mixtures were greater than both monoculture cereal and clover crops at both locations. The proportion of clover in mixtures was 20–31% in the first harvest, resulting in slightly lower neutral detergent fiber concentrations than in monoculture cereal crop at Falęcin, but no improvement in nutritive value at Mochełek. By spring 2012, most Caucasian clover had died from Sclerotinia trifoliorum infection at both locations, so forage was not harvested in the second year of the experiment. Although total season forage yields were greater for mixtures than for either monoculture cereal or Caucasian clover, this system cannot be recommended for northern Europe because of failure for Caucasian clover to persist.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of water stress on maternal plants on subsequent seed quality of bambara groundnut. A single bambara groundnut landrace was characterised into four distinct selections based on seed coat and speckling colour. Initial seed quality (viability and vigour) was evaluated prior to planting seed in a field trial under irrigated and rainfed conditions. Final yield and yield components were determined at harvest. Thereafter, seed quality (viability and vigour) of progeny of different landrace selections was evaluated. Yield was lower under rainfed than irrigated conditions. Overall, subsequent seed quality showed improvement from initial seed quality of the original seedlot. Seed viability was higher in seeds produced under irrigated than rainfed conditions. Seed quality of bambara groundnut may be reduced underwater-limited production conditions. Seed enhancement practices such as priming may assist farmers to achieve better emergence. In the long term, seed production should be done under optimum conditions in order to achieve high-seed quality.",

In a plot experiment at Ultuna, Uppsala, the influence of rain intensities on phosphorus (P) transport in the uppermost 0.5 m of a clay soil was studied at 16 locations. A rain simulator, 0.5 × 0.5 m and mounted 1 m above the soil surface, was used to simulate 85–500 min rain sequences causing small (4–9 mm h−1) and large (22–28 mm h−1 and one extreme at 37 mm h−1) steady water fluxes (intensity) in the underlying soil profile. Water percolated to a zero-tension collector tray at 0.5 m depth where drain water and its sediment load was sampled at discrete time intervals. The total P (TP) mass flux ranged, at low intensity, between 12–92 μg m−2 min−1 (average 28.1 μg m−2 min−1) and, at high intensity, between 83–375 μg m−2 min−1 (average 168.5 μg m−2 min−1) and 648 μg m−2 min−1 at the extreme intensity. The soluble reactive (inorganic) P (SRP) mass flux ranged, at low intensity, between 1–65 μg m−2 min−1 (average 10.0 μg m−2 min−1) and, at high intensity, between 6–205 μg m−2 min−1 (average 47.9 μg m−2 min−1) and 495 μg m−2 min−1 at the extreme intensity. Thus, in the intensity range 4–28 mm h−1, TP and SRP increased, on average, by approximately 12% (μg m−2 min−1) per unit increase in intensity (mm h−1).

Increased acidity is known to reduce soil fertility and may trigger P leaching from non-calcareous soils. As part of advisor training, 25 farms each in Pomerania and north-western Mazovia were visited and 1500 ha arable soil, including 180 ha grassland soil, were monitored in 2013–2014. The soil was mainly coarse textured, but 25% of the Pomeranian farms were dominated by silty or clayey soils. More or less regular drainage systems were found on 20% of the farms, while 50% had simpler, older (>30 years) systems with a few single pipes. The farmers often used only ammonium sulphate or other acidifying N mineral fertiliser. Median pH on the Pomeranian farms, analysed in potassium chloride solution [pH(KCl)], was 5.2 and liming was advised for fields on most (72%) of these farms. Soil P content, measured by double-lactate extraction (PDL), was positively and significantly correlated (Pearson coefficient 0.57; p < .001) with soil pH and was generally higher for pig farms. Mean PDL (P given in elemental form) tended to be lower on dairy farms and arable farms and was significantly lower (mean 51 mg PDL kg−1 soil) on mixed farms (with just a few cows and poultry) than on pig farms (mean 122 mg PDL kg−1 soil). Farm-gate balances indicated deficits of P and potassium (K) on many of the small mixed farms in Pomerania and the soil can be expected to be nutrient depleted. In contrast, the pig farms demonstrated surplus farm-gate P balances (mean 27 kg ha−1). The P leaching risk is discussed relative to soil threshold values and to results from Swedish long-term field experiments.",

Plants have morphological and biochemical responses to enhance mineral solubility in the soil and facilitate uptake, such as root plasticity, secretion processes and symbioses. Root architecture modification is an important plant response to nutrient availability. The aim of this study was to identify root morphological reactions to Zn efficiency in Iranian bread wheat genotypes. Soil and solution cultures were used to survey Zn efficiency. In soil culture, six and seven genotypes with high and low Zn contents were selected among 110 Iranian bread wheat genotypes, respectively. The solution culture experiments were set up in a completely randomized block design and plants fed with Johnson’s grass solution. All traits were assessed at 30 and 60 DAPs (days after planting). Our results showed a significant difference between two groups of efficient and inefficient genotypes only at 60 DAP, and Zn-efficient genotypes showed 1.63-, 1.50-, 1.69- and 1.92-fold increases in root diameter, surface area density, shoot and root dry weight, respectively, compared to inefficient genotypes. In contrast, Zn-inefficient genotypes had 1.20- and 2.62-fold more root length and fineness, respectively, than efficient genotypes. The positive significant correlations were observed between shoot and Zn uptake as well as root dry weight and Zn uptake at both stages. Furthermore, shoot and root dry weight showed a significant correlation with root fineness, diameter and surface area density at both stages. The path analysis showed indirect effects on Zn uptake through root traits. Our results showed that roots have a major role in Zn efficiency. Therefore, the better growth and greater Zn uptake in efficient genotypes, compared to inefficient ones, can be attributed to greater root diameter and surface area density, and lower root fineness in these genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Globally, most of the crop-related developmental projects collapsed due to the existence of aggressive plant-parasitic nematodes. Intensive South African biofortification efforts using exotic and local sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) cultivars have hardly considered the inclusion of nematode resistance in plant breeding, despite the withdrawal of most nematicides from agrochemical markets. The objective of this study was to screen 12 selected biofortification sweet potato cultivars for host-status to South Africa tropical root-knot (Meloidogyne species) nematodes. Three exotic orange-fleshed, three local orange-fleshed and six cream-fleshed cultivars were used in three separate experiments of M. javanica and races 2 and 4 of M. incognita. In each experiment, 6000 eggs and second-stage juveniles/plant were used for inoculation, with nematode assessment performed at 56 days after inoculation. All tested biofortification exotic (except for cv. 'W-119') and local cultivars were hosts to Meloidogyne species and races, whereas three non-biofortication local cultivars, namely, 'Bosbok', 'Blesbok' and 'Mvuvhelo' were non-hosts. In conclusion, the findings suggested the likelihood of the existence of non-host-status in certain exotic and local sweet potato cultivars for use in plant breeding programmes against South African Meloidogyne species and races.",

Due to the widespread distribution of different Meloidogyne species and races, exotic cultivars should be matched with nematode populations in importing countries. The objective of this study was to determine the interrelations between exotic beetroot cultivars ‘Detroit Red Dark’ and ‘Crimson Globe’ with Meloidogyne species in the predominant beetroot-producing regions in South Africa. Different inoculum series of M. incognita and M. javanica were used on the two beetroot cultivars. At 56 days after initiating the treatments, roots of both cultivars had small undeveloped root galls, with the reproductive factor values of M. incognita on ‘Detroit Dark Red’ being above and below unity at low (≤125 inoculation) and high (≥250 inoculation) nematode levels, respectively. Growth of ‘Detroit Dark Red’ was significantly stimulated and inhibited at low and high nematode infection levels, respectively. In contrast, RF values for M. javanica on ‘Crimson Globe’ were below unity, without any significant effects on plant growth. In conclusion, ‘Detroit Dark Red’ was tolerant to M. incognita, whereas ‘Crimson Globe’ was resistant to M. javanica.",

The sulfentrazone was applied at 360, 480 and 720 g a.i. ha−1 rates as pre-emergence herbicide. Its residues in soil and in soybean at harvest were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Results showed that the sulfentrazone dissipation in soil followed first-order reaction kinetics with the half-lives of 5.5 to 14.8 days. Terminal residue in shoot and grain showed that sulfentazone at 360 g ha−1 can be safely applied for weed control in soybean since there was no phytotoxicity injury to the crop. The residue in soybean grain was within the safe limits (0.05 µg g−1) as proposed by US. However, the detection of sulfentrazone residue in soil at harvest and carryover injury to bioindicator signified the risk for crops in succession. Hence the use of this herbicide in soil with low organic matter and coarse texture is questionable as it is highly mobile. Further biomagnifications of sulfentrazone residue in soil and crop produce under continuous use and interaction of climatic variables and soil properties on its persistence, sorption and leaching behavior need to be investigated.",

The mean photosynthetic flux was 15–22 mol m−2 day−1. The mean relative growth rate was increased by 7% in Betula and by 10% in Picea at the highest CO2 concentration.

High CO2 levels increased the stem diameter and the number of lateral shoots in Betula. Increasing the temperature did not affect the assimilate partitioning between leaf, stem and root in Betula, but the needle:stem ratio decreased in Picea. Elevated CO2 concentration increased the number of lateral shoots in Betula more at 15 than at 20 °C, however, the total weight of the lateral shoots was not affected. With this exception the effect of CO2 was generally the same at both temperatures. Measurements of the CO2 exchange rates indicated that a slight acclimation to high CO2 had taken place at the end of the experimental period in the two species.

    "abstract": "Abstract Several methods have been developed to assess differences in cultivar response to drought. This study consisted of 19 oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivars and breeding lines and three species of wild oats, and focused on comparison of several physiological screening methods -CO2 exchange rate (CER), stomatal conductance, stomatal resistance, disparity between air and leaf temperatures, accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and proline, and relative water content (RWC) - with yield losses. Early drought, occurring at four-five leaf stage or close to pollination date resulted in significantly reduced above-ground vegetative biomass and panicle weight. Reductions in panicle weight due to drought were greater than those in vegetative phytomass, which resulted in decreased harvest index (HI). Drought stress significantly increased stomatal resistance and accumulation of ABA and proline, whereas stomatal conductance, disparity between air and leaf temperatures and RWC, decreased owing to water deficit. Comparison of screening methods by calculating drought tolerance indices showed that none of the indices was associated with degree of yield losses. However, photosynthetic characters correlated with RWC both at early growth stages and close to pollination. Therefore, further studies that profoundly evaluate the relationship between these screening methods and degree of yield losses are needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Four rates of straw (0, 4, 8 and 12 t ha−1 yr−1) were incorporated in a field experiment with continuous spring barley. The experiment was conducted on a sandy soil (5.5% clay) and a sandy loam soil (11.2% clay). After eight years, the straw incorporation was combined with catch-crop growing with and without winter application of animal slurry and also spring fertilization with mineral fertilizer (0, 50, 100 or 125 kg N ha−1 yr−1). The combined experiment was conducted for three lyears on the sandy soil and for four years on the sandy loam soil. The effects on barley dry matter yield and N uptake are presented together with the long-term effects of the straw incorporations on crop growth and soil C and N. Grain yield on the sandy loam was unaffected by straw incorporation. On the sandy soil the highest straw application rates reduced grain yield in the unfertilized barley. When the barley received mineral fertilizer at recommended levels (100 kg N ha−1 yr−1), grain yield on this soil was also unaffected by the high straw rates. Including a catch crop had a positive effect on the grain yield of barley on both soils. The total N uptake in grain and straw generally increased with straw application up to 8 t ha−1 yr−1. With the highest straw application rate (12 t ha−1 yr−1), the total N uptake decreased but still exceeded N uptake in barley grown with straw removal. The barley accumulated higher amounts of N when a catch crop was included. The total N uptake in the barley was significantly higher after animal slurry application. The extra N uptake, however, was much lower than the amounts of N applied with the slurry. Incorporation of straw had only a small influence on N uptake after slurry application. The straw, therefore, was not able to store the applied N during winter. In the two four-year periods before the combined experiment, grain yield on the sandy loam was generally negatively affected by straw incorporations. In the second period, N uptake began to show a positive effect of the straw. On the sandy soil, grain yield and N uptake during the whole period were generally positively affected by the straw incorporations except for the highest straw rate (12 t ha−1 yr−1). The sandy loam soil showed higher increases in C and N content after the repeated straw incorporations and catch-crop growing than the sandy soil. When application of animal slurry was combined with the catch crop, no further increases in soil C and N were found relative to soil where a catch crop was grown without slurry application. Large amounts of the N applied with the slurry may therefore have been lost by denitrification or nitrate leaching.",

The equation was expanded by a growth index (GI) correcting for variations in radiation, temperature and plant-available soil moisture, and an ageing function describing the decrease in growth rate caused by advance in phenological development. The field sites covered a wide range of climatic conditions and the yield was recorded at five phenological stages from leaf stage to anthesis. The expansion of the equation appeared to be adequate for a combined analysis of the dry matter yield in meadow fescue and timothy. The estimated maximum growth rate during the linear phase (C m) did not differ significantly between species. C m increased with higher N application. It was concluded that C m of the expanded model represented a potential rate, whereas the relative growth rate of the exponential phase (R m) could not be considered as a potential rate. It varied more among locations and years, e.g. it was strongly affected by the length of the period from growth onset to the start of the linear phase.",

On average, two-row barley accessions had better establishment, covering and standability (although they were slightly taller) but showed lower tillering than six-row barley accessions. Two-row barley accessions also had larger spikes with fewer kernels, but heavier weight, than six-row barley accessions. There were significant phenotypic correlations among the characteristics scored. However, not all of them were common to two- and six-row barley accessions, which suggests the evolution of distinct genetic systems controlling these associations in the two sets of barley accessions.

    "abstract": "A chemical basis for discrimination between attended and unattended aphid mutualists by the ant Lasius niger (L.) (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) was investigated. In an arena bioassay, hexane extracts of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Homoptera, Aphididae), which had been attended by the ant colony provoked significantly longer examination by ants than extracts of unattended aphids. Extracts of the ants themselves were significantly more active than hexane. In an olfactometer, ants spent significantly longer in the arm containing the odour of live aphids that had been attended by the ants than in arms containing the odour of unattended aphids. When unattended aphids were introduced onto an aphid-infested plant under attendance by L. niger, they suffered higher levels of attack and removal by the ants than did previously attended aphids. Unattended aphids treated with the extract of attended aphids suffered higher levels of attack than attended aphids, but lower levels of removal than unattended aphids. The results show that L. niger can discriminate between aphids that the colony have attended and unattended aphids of the same species using chemical cues.",

    "abstract": "Residues of the fungicides vinclozolin and procymidone, used to control the Botrytis cinerea disease, were studied in greenhouse grown lettuce, tomato and cucumber. Residue concentrations differed between the species of treated vegetables, and depended mostly on time of picking (harvest), size of fruits and mode of chemical application. The differences in concentration between one and two applications became smaller with time after application. The greatest differences occurred in lettuce. The residue contents in cucumber fruits assigned both for industrial and home processing (pickling) were higher than the legal limit (3 mg/kg). As a result of washing cucumbers, 22–24% of the residue was eliminated, and by peeling them 79–85% of the vinclozolin and procymidone residues were eliminated. Therefore it is reasonable that one or two applications of these fungicides should be used, with a time lapse of 14 days, but only with cucumbers intended for salad consumption. Vinclozolin residues, when used as vaporisation tablets, were in all cases 35–65% lower compared with the wettable powder (WP) formulation; however, the rate of of residue decrease was much slower. When applied in the form of vaporable tablets, the vinclozolin residue concentration was lower in all the sampled fruits in comparison with the WP formulation. The concentration of fungicide residues detected in winter tomato fruits was higher than that of the spring crop. Irrespective of vegetable the detected levels of fungicide residues were lower in ripe and bigger fruits than in green and smaller ones.",

The percolation of the nitrate content was assessed in the effluent water during two vegetative periods using belowground lysimeters in various crop rotations on a slightly humous sandy soil in Hungary. As well as annual element analysis and organic matter assessments, the bi-weekly nitrate-leaching tendency was monitored as a function of organic and conventional agriculture under horticultural and arable field conditions. A large annual variation in the nitrate content was detected in the percolated water during both vegetative periods at the 500–600 mm rainfall level. Residual nitrate content of the soils was higher in conventional treatments, while for the microelements an increasing amount was realized after three consecutive vegetative periods in the organic agriculture. A positive relationship was recorded between the nitrate loss and both rainfall pattern and fertilizer/pig manure application. In addition to these findings the horticultural practice could produce a higher rate of percolates and an increased cumulative nitrate loss in both crop years. Although the rates and the tendencies of the farmyard manure or fertilizer applications were rather dependent on the cultivated crops, a lower nitrate loss was found in the arable field conditions. In horticultural practice, however, permanently a more regular nitrate loss could be recorded, especially in the organic agriculture. Results showed that such regular monitoring with the applied lysimeter technique should serve as a reliable tool for managing economically- and environmentally-sound agricultural practices.",

Our objectives were to study the effects of cultivar maturity on yield, yield components and to determine adaptation and yielding potential of 18 soybean cultivars (six cultivars in each of the maturity groups II, III and IV) in the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey in 2000 and 2001. The experimental design was randomized complete block with three replications. Effects of maturity group (MG) on seed yield, yield components, and key phenological stages were significant. Cultivars in MG IV had significantly higher seed yield, plant height, lowest pod height and number of nodes/plant than cultivars in MG II and III. Among cultivars, the highest seed yield was obtained from KS4895 (MG IV) with 3.75 t/ha and the lowest was obtained from Dwight (MG II) with 1.18 t/ha. Except for the number of seeds/pod, all of the measured yield components and key phenological stages were significantly and positively correlated with seed yield. Based on the path analysis of the combined data, it was found that the number of seed/m2, the period from VE to R1 and from R1 to R7 had greatest positive direct effect on seed yield. The results of the current study showed that cultivars in MG IV were best adapted and best suited for a wheat-soybean double cropping system in the eastern Mediterrenean region of Turkey.",

Three fertilizer rates were used, and the amount was increased three times during the trial because of low mineral content in the leaves and insignificant yield response. Yield parameters, macro nutrient content in leaves and content of soluble solids in fruit juice were recorded over 11 years. The variation between years was significant for all parameters recorded, but the fertilization strategies had only a minor effect over time. Content of macro nutrients in leaves was low compared to recommended values, and did not respond significantly to increasing fertilizer amounts. Yield decreased with plant age. Frost reduced yield in at least two years, but few significant correlations with precipitation and temperature were found. A good water access seems to be important for a stable fruit yield, while precipitation during flowering is likely to reduce yield because of fruit drop.",

The soil of the experimental site is a Dystric Albeluvisol and textural class is sandy loam (sand (2.0–0.05 mm) 51%; silt (0.05–0.002 mm) 34%; clay (<0.002 mm) 15%). Moderate periodical liming at×0.5 rate every 7 years enabled us to maintain soil reaction at a low acidity level (pH in KCl 5.5), whereas when the soil was limed intensively at × 2.0 rate every 3–4 years topsoil reaction was slightly alkaline: pH in KCl 7.2. Moderate liming (×0.5 rate every 7 years) affects an increase in the amount of agronomically-valuable mesoaggregates (especially of 1.0–2.0 and 1.0–0.5 mm size class). Microbe distribution in different aggregate fractions in acid and moderately limed soil were not significantly different. In intensively limed soil, there was an observed tendency of microbe displacement from the smallest aggregate-size classes to the largest (1.0–2.0 mm).",

The objective of this research was to test the effect of different sowing techniques on plant establishment and the subsequent seed yield. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is used as the model grass due to its large importance in Danish agriculture. In a three-year trial six different methods of under-sowing of perennial ryegrass in a spring barley cover crop were employed. Perennial ryegrass was either sown directly at different depths within the spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) rows or placed 2, 6, or 12 cm from the spring barley rows. Results of dry-matter yield indicate that the best establishment of the grass occurred when placing the grass 6 or 12 cm from the cover-crop row, and this is of importance in less vigorous grasses. Overall, no seed-yield difference has been observed for perennial ryegrass when placing the grass 2, 6, or 12 cm from the cover-crop row. Placement of the ryegrass seed crop 6 cm from the cereal row showed that a significant yield increase of 34–71 kg ha−1 can be obtained compared with sowing in the cereal row.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tree clearing is a topical issue the world over. In Queensland, the high rates of clearing in the past were mainly to increase pasture production. The present research evaluates the impact of clearing on some soil biological properties, i.e. total soil respiration, root respiration, microbial respiration, and microbial biomass (C and N), and the response of soil respiration to change in temperature. In-field and laboratory (polyhouse) experiments were undertaken. For in-field studies, paired cleared and uncleared pasture plots were selected to represent three major tree communities of the region, i.e. Eucalyptus populnea, E. melanophloia, and Acacia harpophylla. The cleared sites were chosen to represent three different time-since-clearing durations (5, 11–13, and 33 years; n=18 for cleared and uncleared plots) to determine the temporal impact of clearing on soil biological properties. Experiments were conducted in the polyhouse to study in detail the response of soil respiration to changes in soil temperature and soil moisture, and to complement in-field studies for estimating root respiration. The average rate of CO2 emission was 964 g CO2/m2/yr, with no significant difference (P<0.05) among cleared and uncleared sites. Microbial respiration and microbial biomass were greater at uncleared compared with those at cleared sites. The Q 10-value of 1.42 (measured for different seasons in a year) for in-field measurements suggested a small response of soil respiration to soil temperature, possibly due to the limited availability of soil moisture and/or organic matter. However, results from the polyhouse experiment suggested greater sensitivity of root respiration to temperature change than for total soil respiration. Since root biomass (herbaceous roots) was greater at the cleared than at uncleared sites, and root respiration increased with an increase in temperature, we speculate that with rising ambient temperature and consequently soil temperature, total soil respiration in cleared pastures will increase at a faster rate than that in uncleared pastures.",

The objectives were to study actual irrigation strategies implemented by growers and to evaluate the method of continuous weighing as a potential tool for future irrigation management. Mean values of temperature, relative humidity, light, and weight were recorded every five minutes using data loggers. The change in weight over time was estimated and related to the calculated total canopy surface area of the studied plants. The rate of weight change was then statistically tested in relation to the recorded external factors. The factor with the strongest effect on total water-consumption rate over time was the light integral. As expected, water consumption was also affected by temperature and humidity, as well as the time of day. Although the growers indicated clear irrigation strategies, the study showed that these were not implemented in a true sense or correlated to the information available in greenhouse climate computers. The study also indicated that a high-precision weighing balance might be an important tool for future control of plant growth and plant architecture through irrigation in the pot plant industry.",

The objective of this investigation was to select candidate accession of hot pepper having high concentrations of ascorbic acid, capsaicin, β-carotene, and total phenols for use as parents in breeding for these compounds. Forty-two accessions of pepper (Capsicum annuum) were field grown and their mature fruits were analysed for their functional and nutritional composition. Wide variations were observed in most of the measurements, e.g. ascorbic acid (25–217mg per 100g), total phenolics (38.4–188.1mg per 100g catechol eq.), and capsaicin (0.08–0.67%), suggesting that there are considerable levels of genetic diversity. Across all accessions the concentration of ascorbic acid was negatively correlated with that of β-carotene (r=−0.33, p <0.05). Concentrations of L-ascorbic acid were significantly greater in VLC 22-I-2-1, VLC-29-II-1-1, VLC-30-I-1, and Janjeera Mirch compared with other accessions analysed. Total capsaicin concentrations were greatest (0.67%) in VLC-30-II-1 and lowest (0.08%) in VLC-32-3. Four factors were computed by principal-component analysis to explain 67% of the variation in the traits. The great variability for these phytochemicals suggests that these selected accessions may be useful as parents in breeding programmes to produce fruits with value-added traits.",

The distribution and incidence of B. lactucae was highly variable, but this pathogen was the most important due to the destructive nature of uncontrolled epidemics. Septoria lactucae caused severe damage, but was found in only one field. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was the most widespread pathogen, found in 32% of the fields, but usually affecting less than 10% of the plants. Pythium tracheiphilum was reported from 33% of the fields in south-east Norway, but was not found in the south-west. Disease incidence was usually less than 5%, and a disease incidence of more than 10% was reported in one field only. Other pathogens of potential economic importance in Norwegian lettuce fields are Alternaria spp., Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani, although they were sporadically distributed in relatively few fields in this survey.",

    "abstract": "Rice crop is one of the major cultivating crops in India, especially in south India. Fertiliser plays an important role to achieve the highest rice yield. Each crop needs an adequate amount of fertiliser for its growth. Inadequate and overdose of fertiliser leads to nutrient deficiency and lesser yield of crops. Rice has a unique fertiliser recommendation based on climatic conditions and soil types but the issue is the random use of fertilisers by the farmer, without knowing their own land soil nutrition. Soil consists of primary nutrients and secondary nutrients. This supplement is used for crop growth. This paper discusses a proposed methodology of an optimised fertiliser simulation model for Cuddalore and Salem district and its sub talukas for rice and maize crops. In this research work, the fuzzy logic technique is used because this is one of the best ways for problem-solving techniques. In this fuzzy logic, Mamdani fuzzy logic-based tool is used. The Mamdani fuzzy logic tool is used for the suggestion of the fertilisers required according to the minerals present in their soil. In result total 45 rules are created for recommending the fertiliser use for paddy and maize crops.",

The cultivar trials showed that commercially available varieties of the 000-group can be used for cropping in Sweden. Yield typically amounted to 1500–2500 kg ha−1 of dry marketable seeds. Cultivars introduced to Sweden should be tested in the field before large-scale production as the 000-classification not fully is valid for Swedish conditions. Row distance (12.5; 25 and 50 cm) had no overall statistically significant impact on yield, but 25 or 50 cm are recommended as these distances are suitable for physical weed control such as row cultivation or torsion weeding. Seeding in the period May 15–30th is recommended to secure germination and yield. The outcome of the trials was supported by results from field demonstrations and commercial cultivar trials in 2013–2014.",

Three N regimes (100, 60 and 40% of the estimated N requirement for maximum growth) were applied on a sand-based green with a turf cover consisting of creeping bentgrass, colonial bentgrass, velvet bentgrass, slender creeping red fescue or chewings fescue. In the 100% treatment, this corresponded to 3 (creeping bentgrass), 2.1 (colonial and velvet bentgrass) and 1.5 (chewings and slender creeping red fescue) kg N 100 m−2 yr−1. The weekly liquid fertilizer dose basically followed the potential growth curve provided by solar radiation and temperature from early April to late October. The turf was exposed to artificial wear and daily maintenance followed conventional standards. Growth, leaf N concentration, carbohydrate storage in clippings, green appearance and playing quality were determined once per month. The results indicated that solar radiation and temperature can successfully be used as driving variables when quantifying turf fertilizer requirements from early spring to late autumn. The desired leaf N concentration, i.e. growth rate, and the resulting effects on fructan content and playing quality can be achieved by raising or lowering the seasonal fertilizer curve. A leaf N level of 3.1–3.5% was indicated as the lower limit for producing healthy-looking turf with high playing quality.",

Although chemical control products for moss exist many are not registered for this use in Europe and Canada. As a result turfgrass managers must rely on cultural methods to manage moss encroachment. A survey of 15 golf courses in southwestern Ontario positively identified silvery thread moss (Bryum argenteum Hedw.) (STM) as the primary species of moss present. In order to determine the effects of irrigation practices on STM establishment two independent greenhouse experiments were conducted in which the quantity and frequency of irrigation were altered. Pots containing creeping bentgrass were inoculated with STM and irrigated at either 75% or 100% open pan evaporation (Eo) and at 1-, 2-, 4-, or7-day intervals. Volumetric water content was measured in the top 5.7 cm of the pots to confirm that changes in water availability were a result of irrigation practices. Between the two levels tested, irrigation quantity had no effect on the presence of STM. In the first experiment irrigation at 1-day and 2-day intervals had significantly more STM invasion than irrigation at 4- and 7-day intervals. In the second experiment point quadrat counts showed that irrigating at both 1-day and 2-day intervals resulted in significantly more STM and that the most moss was observed with the daily irrigation regime. Root data were also collected to determine the effect of irrigation practices on root mass. The daily irrigation treatments in both experiments had reduced root mass although in the first experiment only the root mass below 12 cm was lower. In the second experiment the total root mass was highest for the 4-day irrigation interval with the 2- and 7-day intervals having intermediate root mass and daily irrigation resulting in the least.",

Better turf performance on GM than on SS was associated with less water repellency at most investigated depths in the 10-cm top layer, 88% lower nitrogen loss in the form of nitrate/nitrite during the first year after sowing, less injury caused by Microdochium nivale, and quicker recovery during both spring periods. A decrease in turf visual quality on SS receiving light and frequent irrigation in the second year was associated with strong water repellency in the mat layer. Compared with light and frequent irrigation, deep and infrequent irrigation resulted in better turf quality and lower drainage volumes.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test if soil solarization is a suitable pre-planting soil treatment to improve growth, nutrition and yield of beans in northeast Mexico. Five different periods of soil solarization were evaluated during the spring of 2008: 0, 30, 40, 50 and 60 days of soil solarization. Soil temperatures were recorded during soil solarization to estimate total heat units. After soil solarization bean seeds were sown in plastic-mulched rows and leaf area, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentration and yield were measured. Leaf area and concentrations of potassium, calcium and magnesium were increased by all treatments of soil solarization when compared with the non-solarized soil. Sixty days of soil solarization produced yields of 3.7 tons per hectare while no solarization produced yields of 2.1 tons per hectare. Soil heat units were positively correlated with yield, suggesting that the increase in yield is due to an increase in heat accumulation during soil solarization in addition to an increase of leaf area and to an enhancement of plant nutrition.",

In a unique steepland formerly used as farmland in the Yangjuangou watershed of the Loess Plateau, three adjacent afforestation transects were selected as the sampling site: two single-species transects (Hippophae rhammoides and Artemisia capillaris), which each represented the single-species afforestation mode, and one mixed-species transect, which represented the multi-species afforestation mode. The results indicated that: (1) The soil organic carbon concentration in the multi-species afforestation mode was 25.8% and 27.7% higher than that in the other two single-species afforestation modes, while a minute difference in total nitrogen concentration was detected among the three afforestation transects. (2) Within the mixed-species and Hippophae rhammoides transect, both the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations showed an increasing trend from the upper slope position to the foot slope position. However, the soil organic carbon in the Artemisia capillaris transect was higher in the foot slope and upper slope but lower in the middle slope, demonstrating a \"V\" shape, and the total nitrogen increased from the foot slope position to the upper slope position. (3) The carbon : nitrogen ratios were no more than 10:1, which indicated the presence of easily decomposable soil organic matter. This study demonstrated the multi-species afforestation mode has better carbon accumulation potential compared with the single-species afforestation mode, which has important and informative implications for future vegetation restoration practices in the Loess Plateau and similar semi-arid environments.",

This agricultural practice consists of bringing soil to the crown of bambara groundnut plants and has been shown to improve seed yield of the crop. However, little information exists if and how the timing of mounding affects the productivity of the crop. To address this, two experiments during two consecutive years in rainfed fields in the Sudan–Sahel agro-ecological zone of Burkina Faso were conducted. Yield data confirm the findings from a drier part of Burkina Faso; i.e., mounding of bambara groundnut should not be carried out around the time of flowering. In a semi-arid area, such as Sudan–Sahel agro-ecological zone and with germplasm maturing within 90 days after sowing, mounding should be done early (about 2 weeks after sowing, WAS) or late (7 WAS) but not at 4 WAS, which coincides with the flowering period, as it reduces bambara groundnut seed yield.",

In this study, we determined the suitability and tolerance of Euphorbia lathyris L. (Caper spurge), a well-known biofuel plant, as a sustainable candidate to colonize saline lands. We investigated the germination rate, seedling growth, solute change and anti-oxidative enzyme activities etc. under salt stress conditions. Our results showed that Caper spurge seeds prefer to germinate under nonsaline environments and high salt stress induced temporary dormancy during germination, but did not completely hamper the viability of the seeds. The seedling biomass increased without any visible distress symptoms in the presence of NaCl not over 171 mM. Further increase in NaCl concentration had a negative impact on the seedling growth. These demonstrate that Caper spurge seedlings have the potential to grow in saline lands. The salinity tolerance of Caper spurge seedlings was closely associated with the regional distribution of Na+ in roots, stable absorption of Ca2 + , K+ and Mg2 + , accumulation of organic solutes, and increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymes. However, excessive accumulation of Na+, sharp increase of superoxide (O2 −), H2O2, malonaldehyde (MDA) and cell membrane leakage, reduction of osmoprotectants, and decreased activities of CAT and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) etc. under high salinity might be the reasons for the restrained seedling growth.",

To estimate the potential role of carabids in raspberry beetle population regulation, the population dynamics of the dominant carabid species in relation to raspberry phenophases was determined. The activity density and species richness of carabids increased with plantation age and were influenced by mulching. In all study years, at the time of ripening of the raspberry fruits, when the raspberry beetle larvae leave the fruits to pupate in the soil, the most dominant carabid species were: Pterostichus vulgaris, Pterostichus niger, Carabus nemoralis and Harpalus pubescens. The barley straw mulch was significantly preferred to the other mulches by P. niger, P. vulgaris and C. nemoralis. H. pubescens did not exhibit a preference for a particular mulch.

Twenty-nine random sets of primers were selected for screening and seven were used to amplify each of the parents and their progeny. The optimum conditions were not the same for the various primer pairs with annealing temperatures of 45, 50 and 55 °C for different primers. The genetic-distance value amongst the species and their progeny varied from 0.33 to 0.55, showing the close relationship between entries and confirming the fact that the Solanum nigrum complex is a group of plants very closely related, yet the parents and their progeny could be clearly distinguished. This marker system therefore was very effective in distinguishing closely related accessions arising from a similar pedigree and could be used for molecular breeding in this species.",

The study was carried out in southern Estonia in 2004–2007. The experiment involved nine recently selected genotypes from the blackcurrant breeding program of the Estonian University of Life Sciences Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Polli Horticultural Research Centre and 10 parent genotypes. Drop off is considerably influenced by the weather conditions during flowering (temperature, precipitation) and the particular genotype. Drop off is lower in genotypes 'Ats', 6-90-5, 1-90-15 and 'Pilenai', whereas it is high in genotypes 'Zagadka' and 'Karri'. There is an average positive correlation between the cluster length, the number of flower buds in cluster and the extent of drop off. A strong negative correlation was found between the intra-flower fertilization ability of the genotype and drop off. There may be specimens with both similar as well as a very different extent of drop off among the genotypes originating from the same crossing combination. Drop off was lower among the genotypes where cultivar 'Öjebyn' was one of the parents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Earlier harvest of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) can be achieved by different treatments of the seed tubers. This can be important, for example, in areas with a short growing season and in organic farming. In a pot experiment, different pre-sprouting methods were evaluated for four cultivars. The experiment consisted of (a) untreated seed tubers stored at 4 °C until planting, (b) traditional pre-sprouted tubers (P) and (c) pre-sprouted tubers with stimulation of adventitious root formation (PR). Pre-sprouted seed tubers have earlier and faster tuber formation, but often lower yield than non pre-sprouted tubers if there is no restriction of the growing season. The PR method developed here, where tubers were sprayed with water to stimulate adventitious root formation and give faster development and tuber initiation than conventional pre-sprouting, can be of value when the growing season is restricted or if early harvest is important. Initial emergence of the pre-sprouted potatoes was monitored in two pot experiments. Emergence was faster for the pre-sprouted treatments compared with the control, but there were no significant differences between the two pre-sprouting methods. At harvest, the pre-sprouted treatments gave higher yield than the control for all growing periods, methods and cultivars, although the differences were not significant for every combination. The cultivars Matilda, Cicero, Ovatio and Superb seemed to respond more positively in terms of yield to PR treatments than cv. Ditta. The new method for stimulating adventitious root formation developed here will substantially help growers to achieve earlier harvests.",

On average, spring barley and oat yields increased little beyond 120 kg N ha−1 in fertilizer. Somewhat higher figures were found for spring and winter wheat. Regression equations for yield and N uptakes in grain and straw were derived, related to N fertilizer input and the yield level in individual trials (indicator of yield expectancy). These equations accounted for 90% of the variation in yield and 80% of that in N uptake. Quadratic N responses were significant in all cases, as were interactions between N responses and yield level. They were verified with data from 27 separate trials performed in 2008–2010. The yield equations were used to calculate economically optimum N fertilizer levels with varying ratios of product price to fertilizer cost at contrasting levels of yield. The optimum N fertilizer level for barley and oats was found to increase by 8.3 kg N ha−1 per Mg increase in expected yield. The equivalent figure in wheat was 16.3 kg N ha−1. Optimum N fertilizer levels decreased by 4.1 and 6.7 kg N ha−1, for barley/oats and wheat respectively, per unit increase in the cost/price ratio. The equations for N uptake were used to calculate simple N balances between fertilizer input and removal in crop products. Large N surpluses were indicated at low levels of yield expectancy, but the surplus declined markedly with increasing yield level, despite greater N fertilizer inputs at high yield. Calculations made for national average yield levels in recent years showed N surpluses of 50–60 kg N ha−1 when only grain is removed and 25–40 kg N ha−1 when straw is removed also. Limiting N input to obtain zero balance reduces yields considerably at average levels of yield expectancy.",

The two sites were considered representative for the northern/continental and southern/coastal part of Scandinavia, respectively. Forty-three varieties of six different species/subspecies were evaluated in the sowing year and subsequent three years for visual merit (turfgrass quality), plant coverage, tiller density, color, leaf fineness, winter damage, date of spring green-up, height growth, and thatch accumulation. The trials were managed as putting greens including mowing three times per week to 4.5–5.0 mm for Festuca rubra and 3 mm for Agrostis sp. and Poa annua. No pesticides were used. Agrostis canina had the highest scores for visual merit, tiller density, and leaf fineness, but also accumulated more thatch than did other species. At the northern test site Agrostis canina had better winter survival than had any other species except Agrostis capillaris. Poa annua and all varieties of Agrostis stolonifera except ‘Nordlys’ had significantly more winter damage than did varieties of Festuca rubra. Plant height growth increased in the order Agrostis canina<Agrostis stolonifera<Poa annua<Agrostis capillaris=Festuca rubra ssp. trichophylla<Festuca rubra ssp. commutata. Variety differences were significant in all species except Poa annua and Agrostis canina at both sites and Festuca rubra ssp. trichophylla at the southern site but the ranking of varieties often differed between the two sites due to different winter requirements. Lists of recommended species and varieties for Scandinavian golf greens are presented based on climatic zone and green-maintenance practices.",

In order to develop guidelines for seedbed preparation and sowing, extensive experiments were carried out in plastic boxes placed in the field directly on the ground for studies of the effects of seedbed properties on crop emergence. This paper deals with the effects on emergence of cereals caused by surface-layer hardening, induced by simulated rainfall (irrigation) after sowing followed by dry weather. The experimental crop was spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Soils for the experiments (Eutric Cambisols, silt loam or clay loam in most cases) were collected from the surface layer of farm fields in various parts of Sweden. On soils with high silt content, irrigation after sowing often caused slumping and subsequent hardening of the whole seedbed. On clay soils, usually only a shallow surface crust formed. The earliest irrigation had the most negative effects on crop emergence. On a silt loam soil with unstable structure, irrigation with only 5 mm reduced emergence to under 20%. Later or heavier irrigation was often less negative, as it allowed the plants to emerge before the surface layer dried and hardened. Deep sowing greatly increased the negative effects on emergence, whereas soil aggregate size usually had negligible effects. It was concluded that when sowing in practice, seedbed preparation and sowing depth should be chosen to promote the fastest possible emergence. Sowing immediately before rain should be avoided, as should shallow sowing that requires rain for the seed to germinate.",

Beauv.), and the seedling growth of cress (Lepidum sativum L.), lettuce, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), timothy (Phleum pratense L.), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and barnyard grass. The hypocotyl/coleoptile and root growth of all test plants were significantly inhibited by the extracts at concentrations ≥0.01 g dry weight equivalent (dry wt. eq.) extract mL−1. The inhibitory activities of the extracts were proportional to the extract concentrations. At concentration 0.1 g dry wt. eq. extract mL−1, the extracts completely inhibited the hypocotyls of cress, lettuce and alfalfa, and the root growth of all test plant species. At the same concentration, a complete inhibition of lettuce seed germination and a significant delay of germination on barnyard grass were also observed. The I 50 values for the hypocotyl/coleoptile and root growth of test plants range from 0.002 to 0.079 g dry wt. eq. extract mL−1. These results suggest that L. chinensis leaf extracts possess allelopathic properties and contain allelopathic substances. Therefore, the plant could be used as a candidate for isolation and identification of those active substances, which may explore the interactions of L. chinensis with other neighbouring plants under natural settings. Further, the leaf extracts and/or their residue could be directly used as bioherbicides, or the active substances isolated from this plant may possibly be used as herbicide or templates for new natural, biodegradable herbicide for alternatives of cruel synthetic herbicides in most sustainable manner.

Root fragments of 5 and 10 cm length were buried at 5 and 15 cm soil depth, simulating soil tillage. Use of green manure alone reduced growth of C. arvense more than any other single factor (81–99%), while root length and burial depth were more variable in their effect (0–96% reduction). Combined treatments involving both green manure, deep root burial (15 cm) and short root length (5 cm) reduced growth of C. arvense consistently by 95–100%. At the minimum regenerative capacity of C. arvense the number of leaves was 3–7 in plots with no green manure, at which time cutting had the greatest effect on regrowth the following year. The level for minimum regenerative capacity was not possible to decide for C. arvense growing in competition with green manure. Combined multiple treatments in spring, including use of green manure and mechanical operations in the upper soil layers, appear to be a potential means of reducing C. arvense infestations.",

Therefore, the movement and residual amounts of nitrate within the soil profile under different fertilizer application rates were studied to determine the most appropriate rates of fertilizer application. Soil samples were collected from a long-term experimental site to determine the concentration of nitrate in mid-September 1999 and 2007. The results showed that -N had moved more than 100 cm down the soil profile from 1999 to 2007, and two peaks of -N were present at different depths after 23 years of high rates of N application. -N had leached to depths exceeding 300 cm in plots where > 90 kg ha−1 N had been applied alone. At the fertilization rate of 180 kg N ha−1, up to 1500 kg ha−1 residual -N was detected, equivalent to 34.8% of the total input of N fertilizer during the experiment. The total amount of residual nitrate increased with increases in the N application rate, but decreased with increases in P2O5 application when the N application was up to 90 kg ha−1 or more. The results indicate that fertilization using a 1:1 mixture of N:P2O5 at 90 kg ha−1 p.a. could prevent -N from leaching in soil used to grow continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops in the rain-fed agricultural areas of China, while providing optimum yields.",

Microbial community structure and function were characterized by phospholipid fatty acids and community-level physiological profiles, respectively. Soil microbial metabolic activity was determined by monitoring microbial respiration, fluorescein diacetate activity (FDA), dehydrogenase activity and phosphatase activity (PHA). NPS and NPSM treatments showed higher total microbial biomass and gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but lower fungal biomass than the remaining treatments. Fertilizer treatments without S (CK and NP) showed lower carbon source utilization and Shannon index than the other treatments. In addition, both FDA and PHA significantly increased under NPSM. An integrated PC analysis indicated that sensitive bioindicators were significantly associated with three carbon sources, one metabolic parameter, and six fatty acid bioindicators.

Results showed that the colony forming unit (CFU) of ACM 941 was lower on the tap roots and secondary roots growing 8–13 cm below ground level than sections of roots growing 0–3 cm or 3–8 cm below ground level. ACM 941 was found in roots at the third day after soybean seed was planted, and maintained high CFU most of the time during soybean growth.

However, little information was known about the spatial and temporal variations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) following grazing exclusion. In this study, grasslands with grazing exclusion for 11 years at 29 different locations were investigated. The results showed that SOC and TN concentrations decreased with increasing of soil depth. SOC and TN concentrations in 0–20 cm layer were 1.4–2.0 times of that in the other layers. The coefficients of variation of SOC and TN concentrations were about 20%, indicating that there was a moderate variation among different locations. The mean SOC and TN densities were 63.36 and 6.62 t ha−1 respectively which were significantly affected by altitude and the mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradients (P < 0.001). Grasslands with altitude of 500–2000 m or MAP of 450–570 mm were optimal for SOC and TN sequestrations. Otherwise, the effects of slope position and mean annual temperature on SOC and TN densities were insignificant (P > 0.05). To explore temporal variations of SOC and TN, grasslands with different grazing exclusion ages (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years) were investigated. SOC and TN concentrations increased by 89–385% and 86–330% respectively along the chronosequence within 30 years. Based on the values of SOC and TN concentrations, the grasslands were divided into two groups, grazing grassland and grazing exclusion grasslands. Within the group of grazing exclusion grasslands, grazing exclusion for 25 and 30 years facilitated the grasslands to accumulate higher SOC and TN than that for 5, 15, and 20 years. To conclude, SOC and TN accumulations of grazing exclusion grassland were depended on attitude, MAP, and grazing exclusion years.",

In this study, we investigated seasonal variations in soil microbial biomass in natural climax beech (Fagus crenata) forests in a typical cold-temperate mountain region of Japan. Four permanent tower sites along an altitudinal gradient were selected and soil samples were collected once every month during the growing season of 2007. Soil microbial biomass (by fumigation-extraction method) and soil properties were later measured in the laboratory, while environmental factors (soil temperature, soil moisture) were continuously recorded in the field. Our results indicated large seasonal variations (130.4 ~ 5558.0 µg g−1) in soil microbial biomass in beech forests – a range that is much larger than previously reported. Statistically significant correlations are noted between soil properties with Cmic, but largely due to spatial linkages. On the other hand, the environmental factors of soil temperature and especially soil moisture largely control seasonal variations in Cmic. Furthermore, pH could be an important factor influencing seasonal change in Cmic at the 20–30 cm deep soil layer. The study suggests no direct correlation between plant eco-physiology and soil microbial biomass in seasonal courses of the forests.",

    "abstract": "There is still a lack of knowledge about the physiological traits of spring triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm.) and their relationship with grain yield and protein content under the conditions of the environmental Zone Nemoral 2. The objective of this study was to determine the relationships among the physiological indices, grain yield and protein content as affected by nitrogen (N) rates. The correlation among leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll index (SPAD), canopy greenness index (CGI), leaf area duration (LAD) and grain yield as well as direct and indirect effects of those traits on the yield were investigated using a path analysis. Grain yield, protein content and physiological indices were significantly (P ≤ .01) affected by N fertilization. N90 level was the best compromise for the yield and physiological indices. The interaction of all physiological indices influenced the grain yield by 27–39%, protein by 42–44%. SPAD and LAI had greater influence on grain yield and grain protein than CGI and LAD. SPAD had positive direct dominant (the highest) effect on the yield only at BBCH 59 and BBCH 69 (50% of the tested cases). LAI was responsible for 19–39% of the correlation between yield and physiological indices. The physiological indices can be used for spring triticale growth modelling and agronomic management for improved productivity and grain quality. SPAD and LAI values, established at BBCH 45–69, can be used for grain yield prediction and those estimated at BBCH 69 can be used for grain protein prediction.Abbreviations BBCH: Biologische Bundesantalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie (decimal system for a uniform coding of phenologically similar growth stages of all mono- and dicotyledonous plant species); CGI: canopy greenness index; GS: growth stage; LAD: leaf area duration; LAI: leaf area index; SPAD: chlorophyll index (soil plant analysis development)",

    "abstract": "A field experiment was performed in Sweden to evaluate the effect of herbicide treatment and selective cutting on the seed production of Cirsium arvense. Four treatments (control (C), selective cutting (S), early (H1) and late (H2) herbicide application) were laid out in a randomized block experiment. The field was sown with spring barley and contained a natural population of the weed. Treatments were first applied 2015 and repeated 2016. Changes in the number of seeds per flower receptacle and average seed weight were measured over time in 2016 from the onset of seed production until crop harvest. At harvest, number of shoots per area and cumulative numbers of flower receptacles, which had shed mature seeds over the season, were counted. These data were used to assess total seed production over the season. Treatment H2 led to a significantly decreased number of seeds per receptacle (49) compared to S (59), H1 (64) and C (67). Over time and treatment, number of seeds per flower receptacle was lowest in the second week (47) and increased over the third week to 69 in week four. Average weight per seed was about constant over time (0.91 mg) while H1 and S (0.63 and 0.78 mg, respectively) had lower seed weights compared to H2 and C (1.04 and 1.19 mg, respectively). Total seed production over the season in terms of number of seeds per square meter was greatly reduced by all treatments (5–20 seeds m−2, or 3–14 mg m−2) compared to the control (6600 seeds m−2, or 7800 mg m−2). We conclude that seed production of C. arvense is inhibited a thousand-fold and equally well by selective cutting as by early or late herbicide treatments.",

The contribution of juvenile hatch inhibition to the overall reduction of the nematode numbers by the two phytonematicides, with cucurbitacin A and B as active ingredients, respectively, remains undocumented. The objectives of this study were to examine (i) the response of Meloidogyne incognita second-stage juveniles (J2) hatch to increasing concentration of cucurbitacins A and B, (ii) the potential saturation of J2 hatch when exposed to cucurbitacins for extended incubation periods, (iii) the minimum inhibition concentration for J2 hatch and (iv) the reversibility of J2 hatch inhibition.. Eggs of M. incognita were exposed to a series of purified cucurbitacin A and B concentrations over five incubation periods of 24, 48, 72 h and extended incubation periods of 7 and 10 days. Methanol-dissolved cucurbitacin A and B were each diluted and pipetted into well-plates making 11 concentrations, ranging from 0.0 to 2.5 µg.ml−1 water solvent. Juvenile counts were made after 24, 48 and 72 h, with those for saturation assessed at 7 and 10 days. Thereafter, treatments were diluted five times, incubated again for 5 days and counted to establish reversibility of J2 hatch inhibition. In all incubation periods, treatment effects were highly significant (P ≤ 0.01), with J2 hatch and cucurbitacin concentrations exhibiting quadratic relations. Minimum inhibition concentrations of the two cucurbitacins were between 1.13 and 1.40 µg.ml−1. Treatment effects for reversibility to J2 hatch inhibition were not significant (P > 0.05). In conclusion, J2 hatch inhibition could be one of the waysthrough which the two phytonematicides reduced population densities of Meloidogyne species.",

    "abstract": "To reveal the regulatory mechanisms underlying the productivity of long-term continuous cropping of processing tomato, a multi-year study was carried out to understand the effects of long-term continuous cropping on the community structures of the root zone microbes. Soil samples collected from continuous cropping of processing tomato after 3, 5 and 7 years were used for this study. Results showed that soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), N (SMBN) and microbial quotient (qMB) significantly decreased with longer cropping. After seven years of continuous cropping, the SMBC and SMBN contents, and qMB respectively significantly decreased by 52.3%, 78.8% and 48.2% (p < 0.01). In contrast, soil microbial biomass P (SMBP) increased during the first three years of continuous cropping, peaking to up to 1.6 times higher than that of the control, which also declined in the succeeding years. Continuous cropping significantly increased the PLFA of fungi, whereas the opposite trend was observed for bacteria, total PLFAs biomass, and the ratios of bacteria and fungi. The PLFA of actinomycetes have no change throughout. This suggests that fungi were better adapted to nutrient poor conditions than bacteria. Microbial diversity indices reached the highest after three years of continuous cropping, with the lowest observed after seven years. This indicated that microbial community diversity and uniformity decreased with increasing number of planting years. Furthermore, our results revealed that the microbial community structure in processing tomato soils changed with extended cropping, resulting to a decline in soil microbial biomass, which may be both a cause and a reflection of the poor soil quality.",

The aim of the study was to compare the yields and gas exchange parameters of Festulolium hybrid (Festulolium braunii (K. Richt) A. Camus) and alfalfa (Medicago × varia T. Martyn) under different levels of soil moisture (well-watered conditions and drought stress) and cultivation method (pure stand and mixture). The study has shown that all the measured parameters were affected by drought stress. Net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and dry mass yield were significantly lower under drought stress than under well-watered conditions in all treatment types. Alfalfa grown in a pure sowing showed the strongest reaction to stress, while hybrid Festulolium grown in mixture showed the weakest. It was also found that under stress, grass assimilated CO2 and evaporated water much more intensively in mixture cultivation than in pure sowing. Higher water use efficiency (WUE) was observed in alfalfa and Festulolium growing in mixture only in the first year of the study.",

Previous research done on human subjects, soil and water has shown abnormalities in distribution of war associated metals and metalloids in war affected areas compared with peacetime locations. Dandelion, as wide spread perennial herb, is considered as very useful plant in determination of trace elements pollution in various ecosystems. Aim of the research was to try to determine whether concentrations of war related elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mg, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Si, Sr, U, V and Zn) concentrations in dandelion (Taraxacum officinalle) samples in areas of high intensity of combat activities differ from areas of low intensity of combat activities, and to clarify possible contamination in dandelion as an indicator (and edible) plant with it's role in food chain. Leaves of the dandelion were taken at locations (28 locations at 11 settlements) were divided into two major subgroups: high and low intensity of combat activities, at the locations of major explosions, former minefields, army trenches … Analysis was done using ICP-MS and data was interpreted using Mann Whitney test and PCA. Results have shown that there is difference in concentration of war related elements among different locations, with generally, higher concentrations of war elements in war areas compared with control group. Maximum concentrations of As, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mg, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Si, Sr, U, V and Zn were higher in areas of high intensity of combat activities. When results are compared with similar researches, overall presence of metals and metalloids is legally acceptable, however, there are differences in concentrations between war and peacetime locations.",

For many decades, indigenous people have widely consumed the tea as a healthy beverage and a medicine. The objective of the study was to investigate the influence of nitrogen fertiliser application on the quality, pharmacological activities and metabolite profiles of the leaves and twigs of bush tea cultivated under greenhouse and field conditions. Treatments consisted of 0, 75, 150, 225, 300 and 375 kg/ha N, arranged in a randomised complete block design with five replicates. Parameters measured were leaf tissue nitrogen, total polyphenols, total flavonoids, total tannins, total antioxidants, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity. In addition, metabolites were identified and measured using gas chromatography linked to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography linked to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The results of this study showed a significant quadratic response of total polyphenols, total flavonoids, total tannins and total antioxidants of bush tea leaves and twigs, irrespective of the growth environment ranging from 150 to 225 kg/ha N. The results further suggested that, despite the growing environment, nitrogen treatments did not improve the minimum inhibition concentration and minimum microbicide concentration of bush tea with extract concentrations ranging from 25.0 to 3.1 mg/g. Bush tea was found to be non-toxic (IC50 above 100) under both growing conditions, irrespective of nitrogen treatments. Despite trials being conducted under greenhouse and field conditions and with different nitrogen treatments, there were no distinct differences regarding the gas chromatography linked to mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography linked to mass spectrometry compounds. The future aims of the study are to investigate the effects of nitrogen fertilisation, the timing of nitrogen fertilisation and the planting density on the yield, quality, plant metabolites and pharmacological activity of field-grown bush tea.",

Microscopic and phylogenetic analyses based on rDNA-internal transcribed region (ITS) and rDNA-D1/D2 sequences indicated that yeast strain TA-2 is Meyerozyma guilliermondii. Pretreatment with TA-2 by soil drenching significantly reduced the severity of black leaf spot disease caused by Alternaria brassicicola and leaf blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. Symptom development of tomato bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum in both soil drench and needle inoculation tests was significantly reduced in TA-2-pretreated plants under soil drenching. Disease severity and R. solanacearum growth were significantly reduced in tomato plants pretreated with yeast culture, cell suspension, or culture filtrate of TA-2 under soil drenching. TA-2 does not produce antibiotics. The present study indicates that disease suppression is systemic, as the roots were treated with TA-2 and the pathogens were inoculated onto leaves or stems, thereby separating the two spatially. M. guilliermondii TA-2 could become a promising natural antimicrobial agent against rice blast, cabbage black leaf spot, and tomato bacterial wilt diseases and might be useful as an eco-friendly control measure, contributing to sustainable agriculture.",

Thus, characteristic of soil C, N and P stoichiometric ratios and their relationships to land-use and soil properties were analyzed in a small catchment of subtropical China. Results showed that there were constrained soil C:N ratios in a small catchment. Soil C:P and N:P ratios were also constrained at the beginning; but they became variable after 10 years of different land uses. Soil C:N ratios in the small catchment were similar to those at national scale, but soil C:P and N:P ratios were remarkably lower at the local scale. Soil C:P ratios in paddy fields were 5.1–76.9% and 16.0–80.4% higher than those for other land uses in 2000 and 2010, respectively; the corresponding soil N:P ratios were also 3.8–66.7% and 19.1–75.0% higher. Over time, soil C:N ratios increased approximately 19.7–29.6% for all land uses after 10 years of utilization. Soil C:P and N:P ratios also increased for most land uses. Clay content was an important factor influencing soil C:P and N:P ratios. Except for paddy fields, N was still the limiting nutrient in most land uses, evaluating by elemental stoichiometry. Future work should focus on determining direct evidence of C and N limitations and their relationships to elemental stoichiometry in a small catchment.",

The structural and functional diversity of microbial population in soil is necessary to maintain resistance to environmental perturbations.

The experiment included five following soil objects: GR20 – rhizosphere from grassland (0–20 cm), GNR20 – nonrhizosphere grassland (0–20 cm), GNR40 – nonrhizosphere grassland (30–40 cm), BF20 – bare fallow (0–20 cm), BF40 – bare fallow (30–40 cm). Metabolic activity was assessed by dehydrogenases activity and community level physiological profiling using EcoPlates. The study also included genetic diversity assessment, with the use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to reveal genetic structure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The results showed that soil metabolic and biological activity decreased with soil depth and decreased in bare fallow objects. Highly utilized substrates in both management systems belonged to compounds of microbial biomass. These microbial substrates were amino acids, especially l-asparagine, and fungal substrates were mannitol and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. In grassland soil highly degraded substrates additionally included d-cellobiose and d-xylose, which are compounds of plant cell walls. Analysis of genetic differentiation among treatments showed unique AOB structure in soil rhizosphere. This was mainly caused by the availability of roots exudates, including amino acids and carbohydrates.",

Six soil types (Canisteo, Harps, Nicollet, Normania, Okoboji, and Webster) and three locations (Lamberton, Waseca, and Willmar) were included in the original study and one soil-location combination was reported on, herein (Webster–Waseca). Four drain depths (90, 105, 120, and 135 cm) were used and drain spacings were selected to simulate drainage coefficients from 3.2 to 19 mm/day. Soil input files for DRAINMOD were created using a combination of measured data from field sampling (soil texture and bulk density), data estimated with the Rosetta soil parameter model/van Genuchten equation (water retention curves), and publicly available data (soil permeability). Long-term simulations were conducted for each location using 90 years of historical climate data (1915–2005). Outputs from DRAINMOD were used to create “performance” indices that enable the concurrent consideration of profitability, drainage volumes, and surface runoff, when choosing drain depth and spacing. A spreadsheet design tool was developed to compute and display these indices, based on a few simple user inputs to define cost and crop price. Internal rate of return was used as the basis for profitability considerations. Results obtained indicated that in general, profitability may be increased with increased drain depth and spacing, due to system costs associated with narrower drain spacings. It was found that when considering both profitability and drainage volume, deeper, more widely spaced drainage systems were generally preferable, because of increased profitability and decreased drainage volumes.",

Differences in common fungicide usage practices in triticale crops between Lithuanian agro-ecological zones suggest that the composition of Oculimacula fungi differs across the country. From 2008 to 2012, a total of 70 winter triticale fields were reviewed for eyespot incidence, and the presence of eyespot was identified in 93.5% of the fields tested. Over this five-year period, the disease incidence averaged 32%. The highest incidence (34.8%) of eyespot was found in the Middle Lowland zone of Lithuania, the lowest (25.8%) was in the Eastern zone and an intermediate incidence (30.2%) was observed in the Western zone. During the 2010–2012 period, Oculimacula acuformis was the most prevalent Oculimacula spp. in the majority of triticale crops inspected. Only in 3 cases out of 27 was the amount of Oculimacula yallundae DNA higher than that of O. acuformis. According to our results, the incidence of eyespot in triticale varied greatly and could be of economic importance in some fields. The predominance of O. acuformis over O. yallundae is an important consideration in the choice of fungicides for eyespot control.",

Genotype parameters defined by the MAISPROQ model were calibrated to observed aboveground dry matter (DM) yield and quality (concentrations of DM and starch) data from Swedish field experiments 2009–2011 on four forage maize cultivars with different maturation rates (Avenir, Isberi, Jasmic and Burli). The model calibration predictability (coefficient of determination, R2) ranged from 0.18 to 0.45 for yield and 0.40 to 0.86 for quality. The corresponding values for validation were in a similar range for the growth model but less for the quality model (0.36–0.38 and 0.25–0.54, respectively). Thereafter the model was used to assess the cultivar performance for different locations and future climate conditions. The simulated DM yield averaged for 2003–2009 varied between 5% and 25% among nine locations in Sweden due to differences in weather conditions, depending on cultivar. The proportion of years with successful harvest (34% DM concentration being achieved by 31 October) varied between 60% and 100% for the early cultivar (Avenir) and 0% and 70% for the late cultivar (Jasmic). Under future climate conditions, harvest of the early-maturing cultivar (Avenir) will occur earlier (by up to 19 days in Lund [55.6°N] and 24 days in Uppsala [59.8°N] by 2085), but with unchanged or even slightly decreased DM yields compared with current levels. The starch concentration will remain almost unchanged in Lund but increase in Uppsala, especially for the late-maturing cultivar. We regard the model predictions of quality to be reasonably satisfactory, whereas those of DM yields are less reliable due to observations for calibration being available only for the period after flowering. Therefore, more frequent sampling in the early growing season is required to improve the predictive power of the model, especially for DM yield.",

    "abstract": "Moringa oleifera plants are highly nutritious and had since attracted much attention for serving as alternative crops in marginal communities in developing countries. Generally, claims abound that moringa plants are pest-free, with ISO precluding the use of unregistered products. However, moringa seedlings are often attacked by an unidentified aggressive spider mite (Tetranychus species) under humid greenhouse conditions, resulting in outright withering of seedlings, with the potential of decimating an entire moringa orchard. Thus, molecular techniques were used to identify the spider mites on moringa to the species level in order to allow for the development of management strategies. Spider mite strains from moringa and adjacent sweet stem sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) seedlings were collected and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene used for molecular identification. DNA sequences were generated and subjected to Blastn search on the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, with the neighbour-joining method used to establish the relative closeness of the test strains to Tetranychus species. Phylogenetically, the test spider mite was, Tetranychus urticae, closely related to T. urticae strains in Lineage I, which is dominated by the Mediterranean haplotypes. The derived information would allow for the development of appropriate management strategies of this pest on moringa seedlings using various products for eventual registration.",

Based on an analysis of the agriculture structure and adaptation of the industrial management experiences in China, this review addresses how to achieve an effective and dynamic management in agriculture in the future. Chinese agriculture is in the process being transformed from individual, small, family-based farmers to cooperate-based large-scale farmers with modern agriculture machinery. To permit a smooth advancement and transition of Chinese agriculture from primitive traditional agriculture to a modern and machine-based agriculture as well as to enhance the agricultural productivity when total area of arable land is declining, a dynamic and sufficient management is the basis. However, there are a number of challenges and limitations: (1) Chinese farmers have in general limited education, (2) the small family-based agriculture tradition and structure, (3) the lack of experience in agriculture and innovation, and (4) short-term profit-based mentality. This review will discuss those challenges and propose corresponding solutions to assure the successful agricultural development in China by effective and dynamic management.",

The study was aimed to alleviate compaction on land that had been under reduced tillage for 4 successive years. Undisturbed core samples were collected from 5–10, 15–20 and 25–30 cm depths for soil WRCs, TP and pore-size distribution determination. A closed chamber method was used to quantify the CO2 emissions from the soil. Soil loosening with straight or BLC produced the highest total soil porosity (on average 0.48 m3 m−3) within 5–30 cm soil layer, while conventional tillage (CT) gave 6%, DD up to 25% reduction. Sub-surface loosening with a BLC was the most effective tool to increase the amount of macro- and mesopores in the top- and sub-soil layers. It produced 21% more macro- and mesopores within 25–30 cm soil layer as compared to the soil loosened with a straight leg cultivator. Plant available water content under CT and DD was lower as compared to that under deep loosening with straight or BLC (23% and 18%, respectively). DD produced 12% lower soil surface net carbon dioxide exchange rate than CT and by 25–28% lower than deep soil loosening with straight or BLC. The increase in micropores within 25–30 cm soil layer caused net carbon dioxide exchange rate reduction. The amount of mesopores within the whole 5–30 cm soil layer acted as a direct dominant factor influencing net CO2 exchange rate (NCER) (Pxy = −3.063; r = 0.86).",

Results showed a strong correlation between hyphal length density and subsequent plant growth and nutrient uptake. Earthworms improved soil nutrients availability in hyphal compartment (HC): E. foetida improved the concentration of soil inorganic N, A. trapezoide changed the concentration of available phosphate in the soil, and P. guillelmi changed the soil's physical properties. We found some indications that different species of earthworm and AMF might interact within the soil. Earthworms and AMF mainly acting on different nutrients create distinct niches for plants. The feeding and burrowing activities did not significantly destroy hyphal length density and made negative affect on plant performance.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge about cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) stalk degradation is important for understanding nutrient cycling in soil. The objective of this experiment was to study the effects of continuous cropping on cotton stalk decomposition and nutrient release patterns from fall to spring. Cotton stalks were placed inside nylon mesh bags on 5 October and then buried 15 cm deep in fields that had been continuously cropped to cotton for 1, 10, or 20 yrs. The results showed that the decomposition rates (i.e. mass loss) were significantly greater in the 10- and 20-yr soils than in the 1-yr soil during the first 16 d after burial. The decomposition rates were similar in all three soils between d 16 and 177. However, between d 177 and 193, the decomposition rates were the highest in the 1-yr soil. Overall, stalk mass declined by 35–40% during the 193 d experiment. The largest decreases in stalk mass were in the 1- and 10-yr soils. After 193 d, 95–97% of stalk K had been released compared with 29–34% of stalk P, and 41–48% of stalk N. The duration of continuous cropping had no significant effect on δ13C, N, and K release rates. The release rate of stalk P was the greatest in the 20-yr soil followed by the 1-year soil and then the 10-yr soil. In conclusion, the duration of continuous cotton cropping significantly affected the decomposition characteristics of cotton stalks. Additional studies will be done to learn more about how N application and irrigation can be managed in the fall so that (i) undecomposed residue does not interfere with spring sowing and (ii) the nutrients in the stalks are not lost after decomposition.",

The plants were subjected to sufficient and reduced soil water regimes in interaction with two N application proportions applied at the vegetative and reproductive growth stages of tomato plants, respectively. In terms of the soil water impact, across the N proportion treatments, the reduced water treatments significantly decreased leaf and biomass growth by 33% and meanwhile remarkably reduced stomatal conductance of leaves, which significantly decreased water consumption by 41%. Consequently, plant WUE markedly decreased by 10.4%. The N uptake and fresh yield were considerably reduced by 37.5% and 39.3%, respectively. Regarding the N proportion effect across the soil water treatments, the lower N application of 30% at the vegetative growth stage significantly enhanced photosynthesis products allocated to fruits, which substantially improved the fresh yield by 32.9%. Furthermore, it significantly improved N accumulation by 9.0% compared to the higher N application of 70% at this stage. Conclusively, when given the certain amount of N supply, the N allocation should be reduced at the vegetative growth stage to achieve high yield and N uptake in tomato production .",

A preliminary trial with different HLA concentrations (0, 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg L−1) revealed that 40 mg L−1 HLA resulted in the highest increase in the root area, dry root weight, H+ efflux, and the number of lateral roots, compared with other concentrations. The main experiment using soil treated with SRP at different rates (0, 600, 1200, 1800, and 2400 kg ha−1) showed that the co-application of SRP and HLA caused a significant difference in the root and total plant weights, compared with the sole SRP application. Furthermore, it increased the nutrient content of the plants. These effects are mainly because of increased proton pump activity and the hydrophobicity of HLA.",

It was observed a reduction in second-staged juveniles hatching within all tested aqueous concentrations of T. virens. The second-stage juvenile mortality was also recorded in the above-given concentrations of T. virens. The maximum decrease in second-stage juveniles hatching was found in standard aqueous fungal concentration (S). Moreover, in the same T. virens concentration (S), mortality of juveniles was also recorded as highest, and was followed by S/2, S/10, S/25 and S/50. Additionally, the application of T. virens as an individual, simultaneous, and sequential order with M. incognita was also investigated in pot-grown chickpea plants and found that its use was significantly effective in suppressing root-galling disease and improved the plants' growth and physiological attributes. According to the correlation coefficient analysis, the root-knot index correlated significantly with the per cent reduction of the plants' growth and physiological attributes.",

Herein, grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] variety Jinza 2002 was used to explore the effects and mechanisms of seed priming with 25 μmol/L sodium selenite [Se(IV)] on seed germination, seedling growth, antioxidant enzyme activity and osmotic regulatory substances under 120 mmol/L NaCl. The results showed that soaking sorghum seeds in Se(IV) effectively alleviated the harm of salt stress. Compared with the Na group, Se(IV) application increased germination percentage (by 23.8%), while facilitating the elongation of radicles (by 4.2%) and plumules (by 18.4%) under salt stress. Salt-stressed seedlings showed increased levels of leaf chlorophyll, soluble sugar, soluble protein and proline contents, and antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as root activity, and total biomass following Se(IV) application, along with decreased relative electrical conductivity and malondialdehyde content in the leaves. Findings of this study indicate that seed priming with Se(IV) facilitates sorghum seed germination and seedling growth under salt stress by improving root activity, enhancing leaf photosynthesis and antioxidant responses, and reducing cell membrane damage.",

In this study we identify bacteria isolated from nodules of various legumes grown in Latvia, using a full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence, used for more precision, compared with a partial sequence of the gene. Bacterial strains in this study have been isolated from 1962–2019, part of which are rhizobia strains from a unique historical collection. This is the first time bacterial strains isolated from nodules in Latvian soils have been identified with molecular biology methods. A wide taxonomic diversity was detected – bacteria species from α-, β-, γ-proteobacteria classes and Paenibacillus polymyxa strains from the Bacilli class. P. polymyxa strains were detected only in the historical collection, while β- and γ-proteobacteria strains were obtained only from the newly isolated specimens, uncovering new potential strains for a commercial legume seed inoculum. Soil samples were collected, and phosphorus levels were determined. Several strains indicate phosphate solubilising properties.",

In the study, five wheat varieties, four for bread and one for durum, and five different weed species were used. The effects of different doses of oregano EO on the germination rate, viable plant rate, seedling length, and biomass of test plants were analyzed. According to the results, it was observed that oregano EO showed bioactivity on all species and cultivars included in the experiment. In terms of all parameters, it was concluded that wheat varieties showed higher resistance to oregano EO than weed species.

The findings showed six land-use land cover areas, where the proportion of farmland and bare land decreased while the proportion of settlements and shrub land increased in the three micro-watersheds. Population pressure and exotic species' invasion were significant factors contributing to the decline in farmland, while a decrease in bare land and an increase in shrub land were the results of successful watershed management interventions. Survey results showed that approximately 93.4% and 84.9% of respondents reported reduced soil erosion and deforestation, respectively. Further, the integrated watershed approach implemented in the area improved water availability, reduced dependency on single crops, and increased off-farm activity. Thus, scaling up an integrated watershed approach can enhance food security and protect natural resources.",

Reductions in soil tillage had various effects on micronutrient concentration in plant parts, especially for Cu, Zn, Mn, and Mo, which were probably related to pH changes at the soil surface. Grain micronutrient concentrations, however, for crop yield potential tended to be in the sufficiency range and were not limiting for crop growth or feed quality. Evidence suggesting a decline in Mo concentration over time underlines the need for periodic assessment of micronutrient assimilation in conservation tillage systems.",

The two soils have almost identical particle size distributions and contained similar amounts of total K, but the sample from the fertilized plot is richer in water‐soluble K, exchangeable K and HNO3‐extractable K. The difference between the sums of these pools could, however, only account for 30% of the K added to the fertilized plot. Despite the long period of K depletion, the soil still seems able to release substantial amounts of K to the plants. According to X‐ray diffraction analysis, the clay and silt fractions contained the same layer silicates including kaolinite, illite or mica, chlorite, vermiculite and a component considered to be a vermiculite‐illite intergrade. The main effect induced by K depletion as shown by the diffractograms of these fractions was a decrease in the intensity of a peak at 1.34 nm and a corresponding increase in a peak at 1.43 nm. This change, which does not seem to have been reported before, is interpreted as a transformation of a vermiculite‐illite intergrade (peak at 1.34 nm) into vermiculite (peak at 1.43 nm) by K depletion.",

The mean Cr concentration in soil was about 50% higher in the study area than the Swedish average. Continuous Cr surfaces were produced by trend surface analysis combined with ordinary kriging. The former method reveals general trends and the latter deals with local deviation from an average surface. While the present Cr concentration in grains reflects the Cr deposition pattern, the spatial distribution of Cr in soil seems to be influenced by earlier industrial activity. The flux of Cr in the sampled fields was assessed using map algebra; the annual input was in the range of 190–240 g ha−1 and the removal by harvests was in the order of 0.6–1.2 g ha−1. The study area is regarded as one of the most Cr‐polluted districts in Sweden, but 10–30% of the Cr input was seen to derive from fertilizers. The use of spatial statistical techniques and raster‐based geographical information systems can be of great help in work to control the use of heavy metals and in decision‐making on efficient measures to create a balance between the input and removal of heavy metals.",

Our results indicate that low RZT inhibited nodulation, nitrogen fixation and plant growth. The plants growing at low RZT began fixing nitrogen seven days later compared to those at higher RZT. The low RZT plants had fewer nodules, lower nodule weight, less N fixation, slower plant growth, fewer leaves, smaller leaf area, and less dry matter accumulation comared to plants at a higher RZT. Rhzobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli cells induced with genistein and/or MeJA enhanced bean nodulation, nitrogen fixation and growth at both optimum and suboptimum RZTs.

Cattle slurry when applied to provide 50 kg N ha−1 and 10 kg S ha−1 did not noticeably increase yield. The S content in forage decreased significantly over the years without S fertilization. At 300 kg N ha−1 and 0 kg S ha−1, crude protein (CP) contents achieved 173 g kg−1 DM and were diluted due to higher DM yields with S fertilization. The true protein content (TP% of CP) differed significantly at 300 kg N ha−1. TP achieved 93% with 50 and 87% with 0 kg S ha−1 year−1, respectively. In conclusion, with N fertilizer intensities in the range of 300 kg N ha−1, it is necessary to apply 25 kg S ha−1 to improve forage yield and quality. On the other hand, with N fertilization levels below 300 kg N ha−1, S fertilization could be omitted.",

The aim of the work was to elaborate a dendrogram of genetic similarity between salt tolerant and salt sensitive and to divide collection into clusters. Forty primers were applied to 16 wheat cultivars different in the place of origin and 194 polymorphism bands were generated for each cultivar. The RAPD variation observed among these cultivars was low. The wheat genotypes were clustered in to one major group (B) and two small groups (A and C). The most salt sensitive distant genotypes in to the dendrogram were SW-20, which was genetically dissimilar with the other genotypes. It has been clearly shown that most of the cultivars except SW-20 possessed narrow genetic background.

    "abstract": "Phytoavailability of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) reduces within a few hours of application while continuous application of organic phosphorus (Po) has gained the attention of environmentalists. Therefore, continuous application of either Pi or Po would not be a desirable approach. In addition, the ameliorative effect of phosphorus (P) on plant growth under a saline environment has broadened the scope of this hazard. However, our knowledge about P release from amended soils and plant uptake under Cl or SO4 salt saturated soils is very limited. Therefore, the current study was designed with two objectives: 1) to evaluate the effect of Cl and SO4 salts on inorganic P release/uptake; 2) to evaluate wheat response to a new combined application of Po + Pi sources under a saline environment. In a greenhouse study, soil was salinized by adding NaCl and Na2SO4 salts and P was amended at the rate of 100 kg ha−1 in the form of composted livestock manure (Po), KH2PO4 (Pi) and Po (50 kg ha−1) + Pi (50 kg ha−1) (Pc) along with a control. Irrespective of salt types, application of P sources enhanced plant growth and P uptake compared to the control. Combined P sources (Pc) gave higher shoot and root dry matter than P source applied alone. Chloride salt suppressed shoot and root dry matter more severely than SO4 salt. Phosphorus uptake and recovery (%) increased in pots amended with Pc. Chloride salt was also more toxic for plant P uptake and recovery than SO4 salt. In the laboratory experiment, soils were amended with the same P sources. After first extraction with NaCl and Na2SO4, biologically available P (extracted with NaHCO3), Fe- and Al- bound P (extracted with NaOH) and stable Ca-bound P (extracted with HCl) fractions were measured. It was observed that SO4 salt released higher amounts of labile P fractions (salt and NaHCO3 extracted P) than Cl. This study clearly showed that Cl is more toxic for plant growth and P uptake, while SO4 has higher P desorption capacity. It is suggested that Pc would not only best meet wheat P requirements under saline conditions, but will also help to reduce the load of waste application on agricultural soils.",

In commercial greenhouses, attack of powdery mildew caused by Podosphaera xanthii in cucumbers and P. pannosa in cut roses was controlled by weekly sprays of C-Pro CE601, a dilution of grapefruit seed extract (GSE). The raw material of GSE, delivered by Citricidal®, is a glycerolic extract from seed and juiceless pulp of grapefruits (Citrus paradise). In both cultures C-Pro at 2000 ppm achieved as good control as treatments with penconazole or triforine. The mean level of attack by powdery mildew on leaves of cut roses one week after the last of three weekly treatments, was 9.8, 12.9 and 40.5% for penconazole, C-Pro (2000 ppm), and untreated, respectively. In cucumbers, there was less difference between the untreated control and the different treatments, but for all times of assessments, C-Pro and triforine were better than untreated (p=0.001). There was no significant difference in cucumber between C-Pro and triforine. Phytotoxicity symptoms such as leaf twisting and rolling in roses (cv. Jade and Cezann) and dark green leaves and indications of growth retardation in cucumbers (cv. Ventura) were observed at the higher concentrations used (3000–4000 ppm). Thin layer chromatography of C-Pro CE601 has previously shown presence of benzethonium chloride, a synthetic antiseptic agent. Further research is necessary to determine if the observed effects of the product tested are due to natural compounds or are merely due to a synthetic preservative agent added. Our results revealed that C-Pro might be a supplement or even a replacement to some of the current fungicides used against powdery mildew.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether small additions to soil of primary paper-mill sludge, a wood fibre residue from paper production (fibre sludge), caused temporary N immobilization and thereby reduced the amount of inorganic nitrogen leached from agricultural land. This was achieved by measuring respiration and immobilization of N in incubation studies at 8°C, with fibre sludge added at rates varying from 63 to 1000 mg C kg−1 soil. Glucose added at rates of 63–250 mg C kg−1 soil was used as a reference. Respiration in soil after glucose addition followed an exponential course with the highest rates on days 2–4. During this period maximum peaks of net N immobilization were measured. Even addition of only 63 mg glucose-C kg−1 soil caused significant immobilization of N in soil. Fibre sludge additions to soil caused lower respiration activities, characterized by two initial peaks followed by somewhat higher respiration rates during the remaining incubation than for glucose. It was likely that hemicellulose, which amounted to 14% of the total C, was the initial available energy source in the sludge as concentrations of water-soluble C were very low. Addition of at least 250 mg C kg−1 soil as fibre sludge was required to cause significant N immobilization in soil corresponding to 5 kg N ha−1. Both nitrate and ammonium were immobilized. Relating maximum N immobilization data during days 2 to 10 to corresponding respiration data for glucose and fibre sludge revealed that microbes utilised similar amounts of C per unit N immobilized. On average, 175.6±74.8 mg CO2-C were respired to immobilize 1 mg N and the relationship between C respiration and N immobilization was linear (R 2=0.984). To make soil application of fibre sludge a realistic counter-measure against N leaching from agricultural soils, pre-treatment is necessary to increase the content of energy readily available to microbes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Leaching of nutrients and major ions from a tile-drained arable field was evaluated over a 25-year period (1980–2005). The soil, classified as a Gleyic Cambisol, received moderate applications of fertilizers. During later years the soil was more frequently under ley, and since 2002, an area of ravine (29% of the total field) has been managed as a permanent fallow with annual cutting without removing the grass material. A decrease in the concentration of nitrate nitrogen (NO3−N) in the drainwater was estimated in 1980–2005, based on non-parametric tests on concentrations flow-normalized with a robust fitting curve procedure. The average concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus after pre-filtration (RPf) of 0.030 mg l−l corresponded to a calculated degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS) of 6% in acid extract of ammonium lactate from the topsoil. Between 1995 and 2005, concentrations of suspended solids (SS), RP and total organic carbon (TOC) decreased significantly in the drainage water from the entire field. Throughout the entire period, there was a negative net accumulation of the major ions to the soil. The order of decrease in relative terms was calcium (Ca2+)>magnesium (Mg2+)>sulphate (SO4 2−)>chloride (Cl−)>potassium (K+). In addition, the soil phosphorus (P) balance was negative. A significant reduction in ion concentrations in the drainwater, including sodium (Na+) and hydrogen carbonate HCO3 −, was estimated. The order of reduction in relative terms was: SO4 2−>Mg2+>Ca2+>HCO3 −>Cl−>NO3 −>Na+>HPO4. Altogether these trends were equal to approximately 0.1 mmolc l−1. yr−1 of positively and negatively charged ions. Based on measured concentrations, decreasing trends in SO4 2− and Ca2+ were also observed in the shallow groundwater (3.6 m below the soil surface), while K+, Na+ and HCO3 − tended to increase. Trends of cations in deeper groundwater (5.8 m below the soil surface) were in some cases the opposite of the trends in the drainwater.",

We studied such risks under northernmost European conditions and monitored the effects of cultivar, tuber size and tuber depth in the soil on winter survival at MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Jokioinen (61°06′N, 23°02′E) from 2004–2007. Tubers of two non-GM cultivars, Saturna and Asterix, and two size classes, 25–30 mm and 45–50 mm, were planted at depths of 10 and 20 cm in autumn, soon after harvest. In winters 2004–2005 and 2005–2006 all tubers planted in the soil in autumn were killed by frost. In 2005–2006, the field was covered by up to 30–40 cm of snow and the minimum soil temperatures ranged between −0.4oC and −0.9oC, but only 0.0–3.5% of the tubers survived and there was no difference between cultivars, tuber sizes and planting depths. Under laboratory conditions compared with −2.0°C and −2.5°C, treatment at −3.0°C for 72 h resulted in significantly lower survival rate of the tubers (8.2%). Asterix, a late maturing table potato cultivar, was more resistant to low temperatures than the processing cultivar Saturna. In general, volunteer tubers are not currently a significant risk for coexistence of GM and conventional potato production in northern Europe due to the cold winter conditions but also due to possibilities to control the sporadic volunteers from the next crop. However, we noted that seedlings initiated from true potato seed are able to produce tubers despite the short growing season. Such a risk could be reduced by accepting only non-berry-producing GM cultivars for cultivation.",

The effects of the method of multiplication, variety, and experimental year on tuber yield were investigated. Plants cultured in vitro from micro-plants were compared with plants grown from tip- and stem-cuttings, and truncated plants that had served as a source of the mentioned cuttings. Two late-maturing potato varieties, Ants and Vigri, were used. The multiplication method, variety, and environmental factors significantly affected the number of tubers per plant and average weight of a tuber. Whereas plants cultured in vitro consistently produced substantially greater numbers of tubers and they were the right size to serve as seed tubers, plants from tip- and stem-cuttings produced fewer tubers and the size of full-grown tubers was too large for seed-production. Truncated plants fell between the two. For seed-potato growing perspectives, the plants from in vitro and truncated plants are the most applicable. Growing tip-and stem-cuttings, the shorter growth period to achieve suitable-sized seed tubers should be adapted. Differences between multiplication methods were smaller in the case of Vigri, which tends to produce more shoots. It is concluded that multiplication methods that result in more shoots per plant also lead to more and smaller tubers. Environmental conditions affected both the number and weight: the dry year, when conditions for growth were adverse, reduced the effect of other factors on the number of tubers whereas near-optimal growth conditions intensified the effect of those factors on tuber weight.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant protoplasts are single cells that have had their cell walls removed by enzymatic digestion. Under appropriate in vitro culture conditions protoplasts rebuilt a new wall and then divide to form cell colonies, from which plantlets can develop. Legume species (Fabaceae) have significantly reduced genetic variability, probably due to their long history of inbreeding, and exhibit relatively strong recalcitrance to in vitro manipulations. Unique properties of protoplasts enable their exploitation in genetic enhancement of crops, involving creation of novel germplasm through direct transformation or somatic hybridization techniques. For these reasons, utilization of protoplast technology for legume improvement focuses on elaboration of efficient plant regeneration protocols, which lay the foundations for more complex research. Progress in the introduction of such technology into legume breeding is still somewhat limited, but recent achievements are strongly encouraging. Successful applications of somatic hybridization and transformation via direct DNA uptake have been already described for several genera, e.g. Medicago or Phaseolus. Isolated legume protoplasts also provide a valuable model in a range of fundamental and experimental studies, involving cell structure and behavior. In this article particularly interesting reports relevant to trends in applications of legume protoplasts are reviewed.",

Based upon absolute root length data, the accessions LA2661, CLN2498A, CLN1621L, BL1176, 6233, and 17870 were found to be more tolerant than the accessions 17902, LO2875, and LO4360. Assessment of Na+ and K+ ion content of nine accessions again substantiated the differing response of these accessions under 10 and 15 dS m−1 salinity levels.

The objective of this study was to determine genetic differentiation present among 20 selected tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius A. Gray) genotypes using morphological traits and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in order to identify genetically unique parental lines to develop breeding populations. Phenotypic diversity was estimated using Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H'), principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). Genotypic diversity was estimated using Jaccard's genetic distances and CA. Shannon-Weaver diversity index values for the studied morphological traits ranged from 0.89 to 0.99, with a mean of 0.95 revealing high phenotypic differences among test genotypes. PCA identified four useful principal components (PC's) which contributed to 73% of the total phenotypic variation of collections. PC1 accounted for 28% of the total variation correlated to dry shoot mass and number of pods per plant. PC2 correlated with number of seeds per pod, grain yield and harvest index and contributed to 21% of total variation. The mean observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity values were 0.45 and 0.51, respectively revealing moderate genetic differentiation among genotypes. The mean polymorphic information content was 0.52, suggesting efficient discriminatory power of the SSR loci useful in future tepary bean genetic diversity analysis. The current study revealed moderate genetic differentiation among the studied tepary bean genotypes. Morphological traits and SSR markers well-correlated in allocating the tepary bean genotypes. The following genotypes were genetically distinct: G40201, G40237, G40068, G40033 and G40063 which are recommended for further crosses, selection and population development.",

In two years of observations, Lepidium campestre had lower flow-weighted mean TN concentration (6.2 mg L−1) than a mixed Vicia villosa L. (hairy vetch)/Secale cereale (winter rye) catch crop (10.2 mg L−1) and rather similar concentration to a Raphanus sativus (oilseed radish) catch crop (5.7 mg TN L−1), both sown after harvest of the main crop. However, L. campestre appeared to have a negative effect on total phosphorus (TP) leaching, with TP concentration in drainage of 0.05 mg L−1 compared with 0.01–0.02 mg L−1 for the other catch crops and the control.",

    "abstract": "The genus Corchorus includes nutrient-rich indigenous leafy vegetables often grown or harvested in the wild in Africa. It has potential to contribute to food security, but there is need to improve it as a crop through plant breeding. However, not much is known about the genetic variability among Corchorus species. The aim of this study was thus to characterise the available germplasm of Corchorus accessions and investigate heritability of their agro-morphological traits. Eleven Corchorus accessions (4 South African and 7 from the World Vegetable Center) were evaluated in a field study at Roodeplaat, South Africa, for their morpho-agronomic traits using a randomised complete block design with three replications across two seasons (2015/2016 and 2016/2017). Data were subjected to ANOVA, principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Broad sense heritability, genetic advance, genetic parameters and correlations were determined among the accessions and traits. The Corchorus accessions showed significant (P < .05) differences in all the quantitative traits evaluated. The data showed significant variability among the studied Corchorus accessions in their agro-morphological traits for exploitation in future breeding programmes that in turn can contribute to the improvement of this crop.",

The study consisted of four sets of paired paddocks assigned to conventional or reduced tillage with a four-year crop rotation applied over time. During the 2016–2017 study year, four sets of paired paddocks were planted to: winter wheat managed for grazing, dual-purpose (grazing and grain production), and grain-only systems of production, and winter canola. Heterotrophic SR fluxes were measured using a plant and root exclusion method on eight permanently deployed PVC cores per paddock. Fluxes from the cores were measured manually using a closed chamber connected to an infrared gas analyser on 12–13 dates during the winter wheat growing season (October through May). There were strong seasonal patterns of SR flux, with lower rates during dry and cold periods, and higher rates during warm and wet periods. Large rainfall induced pulses of SR flux were observed for both tillage systems. There was no consistent large-scale difference in SR flux between tillage treatments applied to paired paddocks. Results from this study indicate SR fluxes from winter wheat-based cropping systems are controlled more by soil environmental conditions than form of tillage.",

It is an important medicinal and ornamental plant and has been reported to possess several pharmacological properties. However, phytotoxic substances from C. alata have not yet been documented in the literature. Therefore, this study seeks to evaluate the phytotoxic potential of C. alata leaves and to identify inhibitory substances for the purpose of eco-friendly weed management. The effect of aqueous methanol extracts of C. alata on the seedling growth of alfalfa, cress, lettuce, rapeseed, barnyard grass, foxtail fescue, Italian ryegrass, and timothy was examined. The level of inhibition of the extracts corresponded to concentration. Several chromatographic steps were performed to separate the extracts, and through spectroscopic analysis, two active substances were isolated and characterised as rutin and syringone. These two active substances significantly inhibited the seedling growth of cress and foxtail fescue. The range of I50 values (required concentration for 50% growth inhibition) of rutin and syringone for the seedling growth of cress and foxtail fescue were 129.5–417.8 and 160.1–466.5 µM, respectively. These results indicate that the two identified active phytotoxic substances from C. alata may be responsible for its growth inhibitory properties.",

Organic fertilisation improves general soil fertility but concomitantly slow nutrient release and the risk of low efficiency of nutrient utilisation by crops is underlined. Thus the study investigates the influence of soil amendment with mineral, organic and mineral–organic fertilisation on macronutrient uptake by plants: camelina (Camelina sativa L.), white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivated on light soils. A three-year pot experiment was conducted in PVC pots. The individual fertilisers were applied at 70 and 170 kg N ha−1. The study clearly demonstrated that independently of the fertilisation type, their doses equivalent to 170 kg N ha−1 caused significantly higher uptake of all analysed nutrients by plants in comparison to those grown in the soil enriched with fertilisers with lower doses of nitrogen. The performed statistical analysis (a multi-factorial analysis of variance and the Principal Component Analysis) confirmed genetic variance in macronutrient accumulation by plants cultivated in crop rotation, whereas on average white mustard absorbed the highest amounts of nutrients except for Mg. In addition, the application of the PCA analysis facilitated the determination of the interrelationships between nutrients.",

A direct implication of our results is that grazing management strategies during the driest and coldest periods of the year in the tropics should be developed based on the conditions most suitable for better promoting faster pasture recovery and a return to production in the following spring; it is unlikely that any grazing management strategy would be successful in increasing herbage production and/or HUE in periods of restricted pasture growth.",

Five varieties were tested from multiple Northern European countries: Bauska (Latvia), Jõgeva (Estonia), Gloria (Sweden), Julia (Sweden) and Lielplatones (Latvia). Two sowing rates were used: 30 seeds m-2 (100%) and 36 seeds m-2 (120%). The sowing rate did not influence disease severity. The varieties which were most damaged by chocolate spot were Gloria and Jõgeva and the varieties least damaged were Julia and Lielplatones. Variety did not influence the severity of ascochyta blight. The variety most damaged by rust was Gloria and the variety least damaged was Julia. The varieties most susceptible to disease Gloria and Jõgeva while Julia was least susceptible. Thus, Julia can be recommended for faba bean production in Northern Europe.",

    "abstract": "In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was combined with the agro-ecosystem model DNDC to assess the climate and eutrophication impacts of perennial grass cultivation at five different sites in Sweden. The system was evaluated for two fertilisation rates, 140 and 200 kg N ha−1. The climate impact showed large variation between the investigated sites. The largest contribution to the climate impact was through soil N2O emissions and emissions associated with mineral fertiliser manufacturing. The highest climate impact was predicted for the site with the highest clay and initial organic carbon content, while lower impacts were predicted for the sandy loam soils, due to low N2O emissions, and for the silty clay loam, due to high carbon sequestration rate. The highest eutrophication potential was estimated for the sandy loam soils, while the sites with finer soil texture had lower eutrophication potential. According to the results, soil properties and weather conditions were more important than fertilisation rate for the climate impact of the system assessed. It was concluded that agro-ecosystem models can add a spatial and temporal dimension to environmental impact assessment in agricultural LCA studies. The results could be used to assist policymakers in optimising use of agricultural land.",

The field experiment was conducted over three cropping seasons with three organic C treatments and three N application rates. Three organic C treatments were set as no organic C amended (CK), cotton stalk (ST), cotton stalk biochar (BC). Three N applied at rates of 0, 300, and 450 kg N ha−1 (N0, N300, and N450, respectively). Results showed that N fertilisation alone reduced dissolved organic C (DOC) and N450 reduced easily oxidisable organic C (EOC) in 2015–2016. Microbial biomass C (MBC) basal soil respiration (BSR), β-glucosidase activity (BG), and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase activity (NAG) activity in N450 were greater than in N0. On average, SOC was 13.4% −36.6% greater in ST and 23.7–59.2% greater in BC than that in CK. ST and BC increased soil organic C fractions, MBC and non-labile organic C (non-LOC) were greater in BC than in ST. BC decreased soil DOC/TOC, EOC/TOC ratios, increased soil non-LOC/TOC ratio and cotton yield, ST increased the ratios of labile C and enzymes activity in soil. Therefore, integrating 300 kg ha−1 N fertilisation with biochar is an optimising management strategy to promote C sequestration and sustain the crop productivity in a drip-irrigated cotton field.",

Our analysis revealed that different rates of biochar do not affect the soil physical attributes due to a mismatch between soil texture and the particle size of biochar. Treatments with biochar promoted an increase in soil pH, P content, cation exchange capacity, reduced the Al+H content, which caused an increase in bean yield and consequently WUE. Our findings expand our knowledge about the effect of the biochar applied to the Acrisols on decreasing the soil acidity and to increase the yield and WUE, and add important information that can be suitable for development of strategy to mitigate problems caused by instability of rains and poor fertility soils.",

In this paper, Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing were used to explore the relationship between the incidence of Fusarium wilt of tomato and soil microorganisms in more detail and analyse the contributing factors of changes. Compared with the control treatment, vermicompost treatment promoted the growth of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Saccharibacteria and Planctomycetes and inhibited the growth of Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, and Cyanobacteria. The relative abundance of Ascomycota was negatively related to that of Basidiomycota. The results showed that the incidence of Fusarium wilt of vermicompost treatment was 36.5%∼73.9% lower than that of the control treatment. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria was positively related to the incidence of Fusarium wilt, while the ACE and Chao diversity indices of bacterial communities were significantly negatively related to the incidence of Fusarium wilt (p<0.05).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of supraoptimal CO2 in combination with different O2 concentrations on seed germination and the growth of pre-rooted stolon segments of Cynodon dactylon. Seeds of “Princess 77” were germinated in specialized airtight tubes for 21 days. Gas mixtures containing 40–20, 40–10, 40–2.5% CO2–O2, or air were injected every 12 h. The establishment of bermudagrass stolons took place in micro-lysimeters for 28 days, while the rootzone was injected with either ambient air (control) in natural conditions or with the above-mentioned gas mixtures. For the determination of the effects of soil gases on stolon growth, the cumulative clippings dry weight, the root dry weight, the root total area and total length were recorded. The leaf chlorophyll, the relative water content, and the soluble sugars of both leaves and roots were also measured. The presence of 40–20, 40–10 and 40–2.5% CO2–O2 increased the final germination compared with the control. The gas mixtures as rootzone gases, affected the plant growth rate differently. The root growth was suppressed in all three gas treatments, but fructose and glucose root concentrations of the stolons treated with 40–2.5% CO2–O2 were significantly higher 28 days after the initiation of the gas treatments (DGT). Plants under the 40–20% CO2–O2 treatment showed initially a high sward growth. The Chlb concentration showed significant reduction under 40–10 and 40–2.5% CO2–O2, while the Chla/b of the leaves increased in the treatment with 40–2.5 CO2–O2 28 DGT.",

The objective of the study is to compare the dynamics of total plant dry mass and tuber dry mass of field-grown potato plants, and analyse the effect of the year and variety. Two local late-maturing potato varieties, Ants and Vigri, were used in the study. The field experiments were carried out in 2005–2007. Significant impact of the multiplication method and experimental year on total plant dry mass and tuber dry mass was observed. The plants multiplied in vitro from micro-cuttings produced lower total dry mass and also lower tuber dry mass per m2. The plants multiplied by tip- and stem-cuttings as well as truncated plants proved to be more adaptable to unfavourable weather conditions than in vitro plants; in a favourable year, however, the differences were insignificant. In the early phase of growth the ratio of the tuber dry mass to total plant dry mass increased more rapidly in the case of in vitro plants, whereas by the end of the growing season the relevant ratio was similar for all multiplication methods and years. All developed multiplication methods are suitable for practical seed potato production in the field and ensure a reasonable potato crop.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of plant sap from organic greenhouse tomato crops show that the levels of phosphorus (P) are frequently low, despite the fact that soil analyses indicate P status in the soil to be good. In the present study, two soils (A and B) with a pH of just over 6 and a high total content of N and P were investigated with respect to release of P and uptake in a tomato crop. The fertilisers primarily used on soil A was silage and blood meal, and on soil B Vinasse and blood meal. An incubation experiment showed that the release of P per unit time was greater from soil A than soil B. This difference between the two soils may be due to lower soil organic matter concentration, with less P sorbed by Al and Fe on soil A, and a fertiliser regime which favours a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon in this soil. Tomato plants grown for 10 weeks in the soils had greater DW production, total uptake of P and concentration of P in the leaves on soil A than on soil B. Addition of citric acid to the soils in order to mobilise P increased plant yield and uptake of N and P on soil A. Despite the increased growth, the concentration of P in plant leaves increased and the N concentration was unchanged. On soil B addition of citric acid decreased Zn uptake in the tomato plants despite good availability, resulting in a lower concentration of this micronutrient in the leaves. The plants on soil A maintained their concentrations of all micronutrients analysed, but the ratio of P to micronutrients increased. Thus for commercial organic tomato growers, adding citric acid with the irrigation water offers a possibility to increase P availability.",

The differences between measured and predicted fruit weight of 'Aroma' apples varied by 0–4 g during the six harvesting dates in 2005, whereas the differences for 'Elstar' apples were 1–10 g. Measured and predicted Streif index for 'Aroma' and 'Elstar' apples varied between 0.01 and 0.07 g/w/w%*index and from 0.04 to 0.10 kg/w/w%*index, respectively. For 'Aroma' the Streif index was 0.16 kg/w/w%*index at the beginning of the storage period and 0.04 kg/w/w*index at the end; whereas the Streif indexes were 0.16 and 0.05 kg/w/w*index for 'Elstar'. The highest and the lowest levels of the gas compositions resulted in the least and most mature apples, respectively. Apple colour was unaffected by air composition. Improved prediction of fruit weight and Streif index for 'Aroma' and 'Elstar' may be obtained using four linear equations and degree days without a reference temperature and improvement in prediction of apple fruit diameter may be obtained using degree days and two exponential equations. The quality characteristics of both cultivars were extremely high after storage in controlled atmosphere for 204 days and the analytical data including the low weight losses indicate that the storage time for 'Aroma' and 'Elstar' may be extended by at least two and three more months, respectively. The highest level of the gas compositions resulted in the least mature apples and may therefore be recommended for storage of 'Aroma' and 'Elstar'.",

The PSD curve is first converted to a pore size distribution, and fractal dimensions are then calculated to estimate the water retention function. The current study compares SWRC predicted by conventional PSD to the results of image analysis in three different textural fluvo-aquic soil samples. Images of soil pores were obtained using nondestructive computerized tomography (CT). The Brooks–Corey, Rieu–Sposito, Tyler–Wheatcraft and van Genuchten models were applied to estimate SWRC. The results indicated that image analysis improved the estimated results of the fractal models except for the Rieu–Sposito model, indicating significantly greater quantitative information provided by CT technique compared to the PSD approach. The Brooks–Corey model produced more acceptable results for all three soil samples than the Rieu–Sposito, Tyler–Wheatcraft and van Genuchten models. Thus, the Brooks–Corey model is preferable for accurate prediction of water retention characteristics.",

At the natural nutrient gradient, N:P of the N limited plant is mainly determined by plant N, while that of P or P+N limited plants were dominated by plant P. The N:K and K:P of both N limited and P or N+P limited plants were mainly controlled by plant K with weak relations to nutrient limitations.

A 2-year field study was conducted to determine the photosynthetic rate (A), efficiency of excitation capture by open PSII reaction centres (F'v/F'm) and chlorophyll index (SPAD) response of various spring barley varieties to different stand densities (SDs) under field conditions. Three seed rates were used (200, 400 and 600 plants m−2) and three varieties (Aura DS, Barke and Gustav). The measurements were made three times during the growing season. Varietal effect was significant on all indicators, the influence of the factors' interaction was significant on A, but SD influence was not significant. Varieties differed in tolerance to weather conditions. Maximum A was established for Gustav in wet year, but for Barke in dry year. The highest F'v/F'm was observed for Gustav under dry and warm conditions. The lowest F'v/F'm across varieties was for the lowest SD. The highest SPAD was observed for Gustav, the lowest for Aura DS. SPAD increased with decreasing SD. The correlation between the indicators and grain yield was positive. Meteorological conditions influenced the A data variation by 46.4–82.5%, 60.9–87.8% and 61.9–83.9% for the Aura DS, Barke and Gustav, respectively. Our research showed that under Central Lithuania's weather conditions the most effective photosynthetic process was recorded in the intensive variety Gustav, which is recommended to be grown at a medium crop density of 400 plants m−2.",

The results showed that using nitrogen-free solutions could decrease nitrate contents of expanded leaf blades, expanded leaf petioles and old leaves, also nitrate contents in above parts reduced increasingly with treatment time extending. In addition, three nitrogen-free solution treatments increased the Vc content of expanded leaf blades instead of expanded leaf petioles and old leaves. There were instead of significant positive correlations between nitrate contents but Vc contents of expanded leaf blades, expanded leaf petioles and old leaves. To conclude, nitrogen disruption treatment before harvest could effectively reduce nitrate contents in edible parts of lettuce, and also improve Vc content in expanded leaf blade.",

Fertilization levels of 100 and 200 kg N ha−1 applied before potato crop planting were compared. Content of soil ammonium and nitrate ions ranged from 1.5 to 149 mg kg−1 and from 3.0 to 108 mg kg−1 on soil dry matter basis, respectively and showed strong seasonal dynamics with a rapid increase of the content during June and subsequent fall down to initial values. The nitrogen fertilization level had minimal effect on seasonal dynamic of total soil nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate ions contents. The higher fertilization level significantly increased crude protein content in potato tubers and yield of crude protein per area unit. The factors of starch content in potato tubers and yield per area unit were affected negatively by the higher dose of nitrogen fertilization. It could be concluded that the dose of 100 kg N ha−1 is sufficient for production of potato tubers with high content of both crude protein and starch, especially in production areas with higher altitude. The dose of 200 N is justifiable only in production areas with lower altitude (below 400 m a.s.l.) that are not so suitable for accumulation of crude protein and starch in potato tubers.",

The survey is based on an analysis of data from a database containing monitoring of grass weeds in the period from 2004 to 2009 on an acreage of approximately 400,000 ha. The survey is based on weed monitoring carried out during a mandatory field inspection of grass seed crops. All fields grown with grasses for seed production are monitored shortly before harvest at a time when the weeds present are a result of a combination of the cropping history of the field, competition from the crop and the weed control carried out in the field. The survey showed that Poa annua, Elytrigia repens and Poa trivialis were the three most frequent grass weeds in grass seed crops. Furthermore, Bromus hordeaceus, Bromus sterilis, P. trivialis and Vulpia spp. showed an increasing frequency in the study period. The perennial weed, E. repens, and Dactylis glomerata were the only important grass weeds with a declining frequency during the six years. Vulpia spp. has recently become a significant problem in red fescue for seed production, and a significant increased frequency was seen during the study period. However, the study also showed that Vulpia spp. is primarily a problem in red fescue crops established in the autumn, whereas spring establishment of red fescue almost solves the problem with this primarily autumn-germinating grass weed.",

Production in high tunnels showed a potential of high yields of fruits of good quality when strawberry powdery mildew was controlled. Berry size varied significantly among the cultivars. ‘Frida’ had the largest fruits followed by ‘Sonata’ and ‘Florence’, while ‘Polka’, ‘Korona’ and ‘Iris’ had the smallest fruits. All cultivars yielded well, but due to fruit decay caused by grey mould the marketable yield was significantly reduced, especially in open field. Grey mould was the most important factor influencing marketable yields. Fruits from matted rows were largest, while the highest yield was obtained on woven polyethylene.

In this study, alkaline metalloprotease (apr) gene fragments from proteolytic bacteria were investigated in bulk and rhizosphere paddy soil from four fields under organic management (for 2, 3, 5, and 9 years), and from one field under conventional management (for 2 years). We analyzed the abundance and structure of the proteolytic bacterial communities using real-time quantitative PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Our results showed that the abundance of proteolytic bacteria ranged from 1.57 × 108 to 8.02 × 108 copies/g of soil. In addition, the abundance of the proteolytic bacteria in the paddy soils under organic management was significantly higher than those in the paddy soil under conventional management. Moreover, the gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soils were significantly higher than those in the bulk soils. The abundance of proteolytic bacteria tended to increase with the duration of organic management, with the highest abundance being found in the soil that had been under organic management for 5 years. However, the proteolytic bacteria communities in the paddy soils were not significantly affected by management practices. Phylogeny analysis showed that all gel bands obtained represented genes from Pseudomonas. Additionally, correlation analysis and canonical correspondence analysis showed that C/N, C, and N were important factors that influenced the abundance and community structure of the proteolytic bacteria. These results suggest that proteolytic bacteria are indicators in organic management systems, depolymerize organic N and hence maintain soil sustainability.Abbreviations: CM: conventional management; OM: organic management; DGGE: denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; qPCR: real-time quantitative PCR detecting system; COFCC: China organic food certification center; CCA: canonical correspondence analysis",

They could migrate to the aerial tissues and most colonize stems through the application of adding 300 mg L−1 matrine into 12531f and 100 mg L−1 matrine into gn5f, respectively. No fluorescent-tagged rhizobia were detected in the control treatment. Alfalfa seedling growth parameters like leaf chlorophyll content, seedling growth rate, root length, seedling biomass and total N percentage also increased the most when 300 mg L−1 matrine was added into 12531f and 100 mg L−1 matrine added into gn5f treatments.Conclusions: Our results suggest that 300 mg L−1 matrine added into 12531f and 100 mg L−1 matrine added into gn5f might be exploited to promote the colonization of rhizobia in alfalfa tissue and positively impact growth and yield, indicating possible benefits for plant cultivation.",

A total of 140 points in farmers' wheat fields were investigated and sampled under a typical winter wheat and summer maize rotation system in the Huang-huai-hai Plain of China (HPC). The average wheat yield in the high-yield field is more than 10% relative to the mid-low-yield areas based on historical data. The results showed in the high-yield wheat field the effective spike number was the main yield component, followed by 1000-grain weight. Uptake contents and ratios of N, P2O5 and K2O in the whole wheat plant were also examined. Along the soil depth, organic matter (OM), alkali-hydrolyzable N (AN), available P (AP) and available K (AK) concentration gradually decreased. Soil critical values of AN, AP and AK in the 0–20 cm depth needed to achieve the maximum grain yield were 85.9, 17.7 and 114.2 mg kg−1 calculated by the significant linear-plus-plateau model between wheat grain yield and soil nutrient concentration at harvest, respectively. These results indicated that the rational application of fertilizer based on the soil nutrient supply capacity and residual nutrients in root zone and optimum planting density are key determinants of grain production in the HPC.",

Humidity regimes and nitrogen amount in the soil influenced dry matter (DM) yield of meadow phytocesosis. The biggest DM yield (8.64 ± 0.77 t ha-1) was found in flooded meadow in the central part of the Nemunas delta in Terric Histosol (HSs) soil, which had moderate acidity and was rich in nitrogen. The economic value depended on the prevailing plant species and was the highest in non-flooded meadows. Botanical composition and plant species number depended on agrochemical characteristics of the soil and management activities: the greatest plant species diversity and the best plant population stability were established in flooded meadow in the riverside part of the Nemunas delta behind a levee in soil rich in phosphorus and potassium and low acidity. A similar number of plant species and similar ecological stability parameters were found in non-flooded meadow, whose soil was low in nutrients, but there was intensified farming.",

Although rapid identification and detection methods are becoming available more, pathogen quantification remains one of the main challenges in the disease management. In this study, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assay was developed to quantitatively assess V. dahliae abundance directly from affected roots and soil collected from different areas in Estonia. A specific primer pair based on the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internally transcribed spacer was designed for SYBR Green-based assay. Strawberry plant and soil samples were randomly collected from different areas in Estonia and analyzed for V. dahliae by soil plating technique and rtPCR assay. The assay was specific for V. dahliae so that the minimum detection limit was 0.93 pg µl−1 of pathogen DNA and the lowest amount of V. dahliae detected in soil was 10.48 pg µl−1 of target DNA corresponding to one microsclerotia per gram of soil. This technique allowed rapid detection and quantification of the pathogen DNA at the picogram level in soils and even in symptomless plants, facilitating the screening of the pathogen in diverse areas. This is the first study about the rtPCR technique being used successfully to assess populations of V. dahliae with high specificity and sensitivity in Estonia strawberry fields. Results of this research can be useful for growers and agricultural organizations to improve available disease management strategies against Verticillium wilt.",

Results show that the early growth, grain yield and nutrient accumulation of spring wheat plants were strongly affected by soil fertility managements and genotypes. Early shoot and root biomass of singly grown plants and leaf canopy growth under standard growth density was associated with subsequent grain yield of plants under standard growth density across the gradient in soil fertility levels. Taifun and Thasos had stable higher yield and N and phosphorus (P) uptake across varied soil fertility regimes compared with other genotypes. Økilde, however, increased yield by 8–34% and N and P accumulation by 1–22% only when grown in the high organic manure treatment compared with other genotypes, indicating that it is more adapted to high organic fertility regimes. Therefore, the different responses and adaptations of genotypes to soil fertility regimes should be included during selection of cultivars.",

However, drip-irrigated rice seedlings often exhibit Fe chlorosis. The objective of this field experiment was thus to determine the ability of plant growth regulators to alleviate chlorosis in drip-irrigated rice seedlings. The study compared three plant growth regulators (1-naphthylacetic acid, NAA; sodium nitrophenolate, CSN; and diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate, DA-6) applied in two ways (seed-soaking and drip-application). The results showed that CSN increased root oxidation activity by 37% in the seed-soaking treatment and by 45% in the soil-application treatment. Seed soaking with NAA, CSN, and DA-6 increased the active Fe content in leaves by 8.8%, 17.5%, and 11.4%, respectively, compared with untreated seedlings. Iron absorption and SPAD values were both greater in the soil-application plots than in the seed-soaking plots. Among the plant growth regulators, CSN resulted in the highest yield (2.2% greater than untreated rice in the seed-soaking treatment and 12.8% greater than untreated rice in the soil-application treatment). In conclusion, CSN significantly improved root Fe uptake at the seedling stage and reduced chlorosis in drip-irrigated rice. Therefore, CSN drip application can be recommended for alleviating rice chlorosis in practical use.",

The non‐pathogens Drechslerei teres (in wheat), Stagonospora nodorum (in barley), Botrytis cinerea, Trichoderma reesei and the root and stem pathogen Fusarium culmorum caused no clear induction of PAL on intact barley or wheat leaves. They were able to induce PAL at the wound margins of barley leaves, although at a lower level than B. sorokiniana. Wounding alone did not induce PAL. Prior inoculation of barley leaves with non‐pathogens provided partial protection against a subsequent challenge with B. sorokiniana seven days later. Induced plants showed unchanged PAL activity levels compared to non‐induced plants after challenge inoculation. The results suggest that PAL plays a role in the active defences of barley and wheat in response to pathogen attack, but apparently not in response to non‐pathogens, wounding, or in plants expressing induced resistance.",

The objective of this research was to select an appropriate secondary crop that could be grown with maize in an intercropping system to control weeds while maintaining maize yields. Field beans (Vicia faba L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.) and thyphon [Brassica rapa L. ar. rapa (L.) Thell] were selected as secondary crops. Acceptable yields of dry matter in maize were obtained regardless of secondary crop. Different yield levels were obtained depending on the morphology of the secondary crop. Thyphon, a high, dense secondary crop with large leaves, shaded the lower maize canopy, and thereby reduced the yield of maize. In contrast, field bean, which is tall and has a narrow canopy, did not reduce maize yield. A negative relation was found between the yield of secondary crop plus weeds in August and October and the yield of maize in October. The secondary crops were not sufficiently competitive against weeds in the first part of the growing season. Thyphon competed too much against maize. Field bean and phacelia resulted in a minimum of competition against maize, and a maximum competition against weeds, compared with the other secondary crops.",

In regrowth the effect of cattle slurry was less pronounced. The effect of cattle slurry declined with increasing R s of the unfertilized treatment and rose with increasing rate of ammonium N applied by the slurry. The positive response to cattle slurry application on R s was unaffected by the clover proportion in the spring growth, while in regrowth it tended to diminish with increasing clover proportion.

Males were attracted to females and to the female sex pheromone component (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate. Females were not attracted to this compound. There were differences between the sexes in their responses to host plant odours. Females were attracted to odour from Trifolium pratense, Medicago falcata, and M. saliva.

This part of the spray is not only an application loss, but it also constitutes a primary source to leaching. The investigation was carried out during 1999-2001 in sugar beets and potatoes. Applications were carried out at approximate intervals of 10 days during the whole growing season in both crops, which were grown in rows. The results show that a high proportion of the spray liquid reaches the soil below the crop during applications at early growth stages, which correspond with stages when weed control is practised. At later growth stages soil deposition declined and reached values below 10-15% of the applied dose in sugar beet (GS 39) and 5-10% in potatoes (GS 59-79).",

This decrease in POD activity coincided with the decrease in phenolics and the onset of sprouting. With cold treatment, total sprouting was observed after eight weeks.

The soil was an acid lateritic (Halustaf) sandy loam. For rice, an N:P:K level of 90:26.2:33.3 kg ha−1 was supplied through the organic materials and chemical fertilizer to all the treatments except control and fly ash alone. The required quantities of organic materials were added to supply 30 kg N ha−1 and the balance amount of N, P and K was supplied through chemical fertilizer. Amendment materials as per fertilization treatments were incorporated to individual plots 15 days before planting of rice during the rainy season. The residual effects were studied on the following peanut crop with application of N:P:K at 30:26.2:33.3 kg ha−1 through chemical fertilizer alone in all treatments, apart from the control. An application of fly ash at 10 t ha−1 in combination with chemical fertilizer and organic materials increased the grain yield of rice by 11% compared to chemical fertilizer alone. The residual effect of both lime and fly ash applications combined with direct application of chemical fertilizer increased peanut yields by 30% and 24%, respectively, compared to chemical fertilizer alone. Treatments with fly ash or lime increased P and K uptake in both the crops and oil content in peanut kernel compared to those without the amendments. Alkaline coal fly ash proved to be a better amendment than lime for improving productivity of an acid lateritic soil and enriching the soil with P and K.",

Recent studies in temperate regions indicate that non-exchangeable NH4 +-N (NEA), which is fixed in clay minerals, may affect crop productivity and soil N dynamics more than previously thought. To estimate the quantity and plant availability of NEA in Swedish soils, ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was grown in a pot experiment using 18 soils that were collected (0–20 cm depth) from two long-term agricultural experiment series at five locations. Initial NEA, total N and soil K contents were measured, as well as NEA content 56, 112 and 168 days after planting of ryegrass. The results show that the soils (0–20 cm) contained 21–217 mg NEA kg−1 sieved soil (5–300 kg NEA ha−1) estimated as corresponding to 0.1–5.1% of the total soil N. Long-term application of farmyard manure (FYM) did not increase contents of soil NEA. Long-term application of K fertilizer increased soil contents of AL-extractable K, but there was no significant correlation with NEA content. Concurrent with ryegrass growth, NEA content decreased on average by 16% between day 0 and day 112, indicating that NEA was released from the soil and taken up by the plants.",

Preliminarily, two different methods usually suggested in literature for the assay of acid phosphatase activity were compared. Since the methodology using acetate buffer gave a higher transformation of the substrate, it was selected for investigating the effect of the metals on the enzymes. The two plant acid phosphatases showed significant differences in their catalytic properties and behaviour in response to the presence of Mn and Mo. Sweet potato acid phosphatase displayed higher activity levels and a greater substrate affinity than potato enzyme. Furthermore, a significant decrease of Vmax and a small increment of Km values were measured in the presence of 0.58 and 1.17 mM of Mn ions. No significant effects were observed for the potato enzyme. The two enzymes showed the greater difference in their activity and kinetic behaviour when evaluating the effect of increasing levels of Mo (0.001 to 0.01 mM). Both the enzymes were competitively inhibited by the anion but with a different intensity at all Mo levels. The different number of protein subunits and purity levels of the two enzymes as ascertained by electrophoretic studies may account for the observed differences.",

The degradation of CpTI in the rhizosphere of the transgenic CpTI+Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) cotton cultivar SGK321 was assessed. During plant development, concentrations of CpTI toxin in the rhizosphere were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As the plants developed, the residue of CpTI in the rhizosphere increased, and reached a peak at topping stage (100 days after planting). After this stage, the residue began to decrease, and was nil the following year (258 days after planting). The conclusion is that genetically engineered cotton can safely be cultivated since no accumulation of substances released from the transgenic plants was persistent in the soil.",

Warming cables were used to simulate soil warming. Warming caused significant increases in aboveground biomass compared with belowground biomass during the growing season, and the enhancement of aboveground biomass increased with plant growth while belowground biomass showed an opposite effect. Significant positive correlation was found between aboveground biomass and 10–20-cm soil content whereas belowground biomass was more significantly correlated with 0–10-cm soil content. Positive linear correlations were found between CO2 and CH4 fluxes and warming-induced changes in liable carbon (LBC) and carbohydrate carbon (CHC) contents. Flooded water conditions tended to increase the accumulation of belowground biomass, content and CH4 fluxes under warming treatment. Soil warming could not only stimulate the carbon-accumulation and -release processes in the TMC wetland ecosystem directly, but also indirectly through the enhancement of nitrogen availability and active carbon contents. The contents of and active carbon could be sensitive indicators for the carbon-process changes in wetland ecosystems under soil warming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The goals of the study were to explore the suitability of direct drilling for Nordic soil and climatic conditions, the suitability of manure use in direct drilling, and the availability of direct drilling after a ley period. In spring 2003, two direct drilling experiments were established on fine sand and organic soils in northern Finland. In the three-year experiments, autumn and spring ploughing were compared with direct drilling. The crop was spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) each year, and it was fertilised with cattle slurry or artificial fertiliser. In the first experiment the previous crop was always cereal and in the second experiment it was always ley. Direct-drilled barley normally produced yields as high as those for ploughed barley (3500–5000 kg/ha). In some years, the hectolitre weight and thousand-grain weight of the direct-drilled barley were a little lower compared with those for the ploughed barley, but not in others. These results are very similar to the results of previous direct drilling experiments done in clay soils in southern Finland and in Scandinavia. Slurry spread before direct drilling probably lost part of its soluble nitrogen, because the yield of direct-drilled barley that was fertilised with slurry was in two years 20–40% lower than that of ploughed barley. The direct drill machine did not mix the slurry and the soil sufficiently. Controlling Elymus repens L. (common couch) was also very important in direct drilling. If E. repens was not controlled every year, the yield of direct-drilled barley decreased by more than 40% in the second year. When the ley period was ended properly by treating with glyphosate, direct drilled barley yields were good. We can conclude that direct drilling is a suitable method for Nordic soil and climatic conditions, if perennial weeds or old ley are controlled chemically and manure is mulched beforehand.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A plant-multiplication technique developed at the Department of Plant Biotechnology EVIKA of the Estonian Research Institute of Agriculture involves multiplying plantlets in plastic rolls on peat before transplanting them onto the field, where the first generation of seed tubers will be grown. Four possible multiplication methods of potato meristem plants were compared from the aspect of obtaining optimal-sized, disease-free seed tubers. The plants grown from tip- and stem-cuttings and truncated plants were considered in relation to the plants multiplied by the in vitro micro-plant cultivation in plastic rolls. The main objective of this paper is to analyse how the tubers' mass per plant and their size distribution depend on the multiplication method, experimental year, and potato variety. Two local late-maturing potato varieties, Ants and Vigri, were used in the study, carried out in 2005–2007. A significant influence of multiplication method and experimental year on tuber weight and tuber-size distribution throughout the growing period was found. While plants multiplied by in vitro micro-cuttings produced substantially lower tuber mass per plant, also their tuber-size distribution was considerably inclined towards smaller dimensions – more tubers with <30 mm diameter (Ø) and fewer tubers with >60 mm diameter were formed. Compared with plants multiplied by the in vitro micro-plants method, significantly fewer tubers within the most proper seed-tuber size range (Ø 30–60 mm) were received for plants multiplied from tip- and stem-cuttings, while the plants grown from truncated seedlings provided about the same yield as micro-plants in this size interval. All stated differences were magnified by unfavourable growing years, whereas in favourable conditions the differences were almost non-existent. The influence of potato variety on tuber mass and their size distribution was not proved. All described EVIKA multiplication methods achieve quite similar tuber yields and seed-production potential, comparable to those obtained by in vitro methods.",

They are located in intensively cultivated areas and were previously used for wastewater treatment, making them a potential source of environmental contamination. Little is known about phosphorus (P) status, disposition and dynamics in the wetlands. Total P (TP) content determined by fusion with Na2CO3 in successive 20 cm layers of undisturbed Histosols to 100 cm depth determined in samples taken in June and September 2000 and April 2001 ranged between 1510 and 3938 mg kg-1 dry soil and decreased with depth. Sequential extraction of TP with a chloride anion (ResP) → 0.5 M (pH 8.5) NaHCO3 (BicTP) → 0.1 M NaOH (HydTP) → 1.0 M HCl (HClP) → residual P (ResidP) revealed an increasing order (% of mean TP) of 1.14% ResP<2.35% HClP<29.26% ResidP<31% BicTP<36.21% HydTP. Speciation of BicTP and HydTP pools into inorganic P (IP) and organic P (OP) did not reveal difference between BicIP and BicOP, while HydOP constituted 70–90% of HydTP. Seasonal P dynamics based on P contents of the entire profile revealed marked declines in TP, BicTP, HydTP and ResidP with time, whereas ResP and HClP increased. Conclusions were that: (1) TP content at the site investigated was declining, apparently due to leaching and retention in vegetation and dead plant debris; (2) summation of P contents in layers gave a clearer trend of seasonal P dynamics than data determined in separate layers; (3) some re-distribution of P among the P compartments had occurred.",

Long-term incorporation of wheat straw and livestock manure amendments significantly (p < 0.05) increased crop yield and sustainable yield index, and POM storage compared with CK and NPK treatments. The mole ratios of H/C in the POM under organic amendment treatments significantly (p < 0.05) decreased by 13.8% and 37.1%, respectively, compared with the NPK treatment. Similarly, solid state NMR spectroscopy showed that the O–alkyl carbon content of POM was greatly decreased, whereas aromatic carbon contents and alkyl to O–alkyl carbon ratios were substantially increased under PMNPK and CMNPK treatments. In conclusion, we recommend long-term livestock manure application as a preferred strategy for enhancing POM quantity and quality (chemical stability), and crop yield of vertisol soil in northern China.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Nitrogen (N) / potassium (K) nutrient balance has been studied for some ornamental plants, however, available information is limited. Here we investigate the optimum N and K balance and concentration for lisianthus production in soilless medium.Materials and methods: The effect of three N / K balances: 1.43, 2.14 and 4.29, prepared by varying the concentration of N and K, were evaluated in lisianthus grown in soilless medium (volcanic rock).Results: Plants fertigated with a N / K balance of 2.14 exhibited enhanced height and stem dry weight when compared to plants fertigated with a balance of 4.29, and a higher flower buds count and total dry weight than those fertigated with a balance of 1.43 or 4.29. Plants fertigated with a balance of 2.14 exhibited increased dry weight when N was reduced from 15 to 9 meq L−1 and K from 7 to 4.2 meq L−1, suggesting that lisianthus does not require high levels of these nutrients. Although shoot N concentration was not correlated with N concentration in the nutrient solution or balance, increasing N in the shoot was associated with higher P and Mg in the plant tissues. In general, P, Ca, and Mg in plant tissues were unaffected by the external N / K balance, however, the internal P and Mg concentrations were positively correlated with shoot dry weight. Shoot K concentration significantly increased when the N / K balance decreased, which is related to the higher concentrations of external K when the balance decreased.Conclusions: The optimum N / K balance for lisianthus was 2.14. However, there was a concentration effect, as fertigation with solutions containing a N / K balance of 2.14 and an N and K concentration of 9 and 4.2 meq L−1 respectively, resulted in plants with the greatest dry weight.",

A total of 235 BNYVV-infested soil samples taken from 29 provinces during the growing seasons of 2004–2005 and 2010–2011 were investigated for resistance-breaking properties of BNYVV isolates. BNYVV resistant (Rz1, Rz1 + R2, Rz1 + C48 + minor genes) and susceptible (rz1) sugar beet cultivars were grown in the BNYVV-infested soils by the bait plant technique, and virus infection was evaluated based on disease symptom and DAS-ELISA. Of the soil samples tested, 57.4% produced infection in the roots of sugar beet cultivar (cv.) containing the Rz1 gene, 51.9% in cv. carrying the Rz1 + Rz2 and 18.9% in cv. carrying the Rz1 + C48 + minor genes. Also, the presence of Beet soil-borne virus (BSBV) was evaluated by TAS-ELISA. Additionally, the presence of BNYVV RNA-5 component was investigated by RT–PCR using the primers specific for p26 coding region. Our results revealed that BNYVV isolates compromising resistance genes are highly common and widespread in sugar beet production areas in Turkey, and it seems unlikely that BSBV and/or RNA-5 were directly involved in RB-event.",

In this study, nitrogen transport and transformations in a TPR field under multiple shallow irrigation (MSI) conditions in the Taihu Lake Basin of Eastern China were observed and simulated (Hydrus-1D model) during the 2008 and 2009 seasons based on a previous study. MSI controlled well the depth of floodwater and reduced nitrogen losses substantially through percolation and surface runoff, in particular during the 2008 season with relative less rainfall. Nitrogen balance analysis showed that both denitrification and NH3 volatilisation were the two major paths of nitrogen loss during the two seasons. Most nitrogen transformations occurred in top soil (0–40 cm) during early-middle seasons. The overall nitrification and denitrification differed slightly between the two seasons but largely between soil depths, averagely 92.7% and 73.0% of respective total in a 120 cm soil profile occurred in 0–40 cm soil, respectively. MSI method coupled with deep applied fertiliser is recommended to substantially reduce nitrogen losses through surface runoff, percolation, and NH3 volatilisation in TPR fields.",

In the period 2013–2014, we used, on the basis of the preliminary test results (2012), the following chemicals: toluquinone, cis–3–hexen–1-ol, ethyl acetate, toluquinone + cis–3 hexen–1-ol, and ethanol as a control. M. melolontha adults were most abundant in the location Črni Vrh nad Idrijo; the traps in this location caught 18 times more of them than those in the first location and more than six times more than those in the third location. Male insects accounted for 73 to 87% of the trapped specimens. We confirmed the highest efficiency of cis–3–hexen–1-ol in 2013 (43.25 ± 0.08 males/trap), as well as in 2014 (15.00 ± 0.14 males/trap). On the basis of the trapped adult common European cockchafers and the simple economic analysis of applying different synthetic substances for attracting them, we found that independent application of cis-3-hexen-1-ol is the most efficient and cost-effective option for attracting the studied insect pest. Consequently, we recommend it as an attractant in the traps for massive trapping of adult common European cockchafers.",

Swedish farmers are recommended to control C. arvense chemically when most shoots are 10-20 cm tall, and mechanically at the compensation point (CP). Recent studies have shown that the CP occurs before shoots reach the three-leaf stage. We hypothesised that (i) herbicide application near the three-leaf stage gives the strongest control, (ii) crop presence increases herbicide effects, and (iii) a 50% herbicide dose gives the same effect as 100%. Treatments of the pot experiment consisted of MCPA 750; 0%, 50% and 100% of the recommended dose applied at leaf stages 3-8, with and without barley. The strongest control was obtained at four leaves and a maximum shoot height of 13 cm, using the recommended dose and with spring barley. In a field population, a maximum shoot height of 13 cm corresponded to a medium height of 6 cm. The 50% dose gave poorer control. Spraying with the recommended dose at the four-leaf stage reduced the development of C. arvense most effectively. Based on this, we recommend that herbicide spraying should be performed at earlier leaf stages/median heights than previously recommended.",

Low soil temperature and the soil nitrogen (N) is dominated by nitrate (NO3−) is probably the reason of Fe chlorosis in this stage. The objective of this experiment was to elucidate the causes of Fe deficiency induced by low soil temperature and the mechanism of ammonium (NH4+) alleviate Fe deficiency of DI rice. Applying different N forms (NH4+ or NO3−) to two rice cultivars (cv. 'T43' and 'T04', Fe-efficient and Fe-inefficient genotype, respectively) under different soil temperatures to study the growth and Fe uptake of DI rice. The results showed that low soil temperature reduced the root biomass and root activity of rice significantly, which in turn, resulted in low leaf SPAD value and Fe uptake of rice. The rice fed with NH4+ had improved root activity and bigger root surface area, higher rhizosphere soil DTPA-Fe concentration and more Fe uptake than fed with NO3− under low soil temperature. The results indicated NH4+ alleviates Fe deficiency of DI rice by improving the availability of rhizosphere soil Fe, increasing the root surface area and root activity. Application of NH4+−N to DI rice is a promise agronomic measure to alleviate Fe deficiency.",

In studies which take many traits into account, it is reasonable to use the Bayesian approach for the estimation of genetic parameters. The main goal of the present research was not only to consider the genetic correlations of the examined traits, but above all to estimate unknown genetic parameters and to gain profits from the selection. Bayesian inference was also useful for the selection of the best maize varieties. It was applied to predict genetic values in the multi-traits linear model. Thirteen maize cultivars representing the traits of our interest were studied by means of Bayesian inference. The traits are the number of plants before harvest, the grain yield, the length of the ears, the mass of leaves and the number of ears. The experiment involved a randomised block design with four replications and ten plants per plot. The highest correlation estimates were found between the number of plants before harvest and the number of ears, jointly with the grain yield and the number of ears. Lower correlation estimates were found between the length of the ears and the number of ears as well as the grain yield and the length of the ears. The research confirms that the best varieties to be grown are: Clarica, NK Cooler, Drim and PR 39K13. The Bayesian approach proved to be useful in selection studies, which can further be used to improve the studied genotypes.",

Winter pea covered the soil at least partly over winter and showed faster soil coverage in spring. At the end of May, just some weeks before harvest, spring pea attained equal soil coverage. Grain yield of winter pea was almost double that of spring pea due to higher pod density whereas spring pea produced more grains pod−1 than four out of six winter pea varieties and a higher thousand grain weight than all winter pea varieties. Consequently, grain density was higher for winter pea while the single pod yield was higher for spring pea. Growing winter peas in Central Europe might be a good strategy for increasing grain legume productivity and thereby European feed protein production.",

Scanning electron microscopic observation of the hyphae of M. cannonballus at the inhibition zone revealed morphological abnormalities including shrinkage, loss of turgidity, pit formation and deformation. These bacterial isolates showed compatibility with one another and with Trichoderma viride. Greenhouse experiments revealed that P. resinovorans B11 was the most effective among the bacterial antagonists in controlling MRVD in melon.

Sodding is fast but expensive and brings with it thatch and sometimes annual bluegrass (AB, Poa annua). Perennial ryegrass (PR, Lolium perenne) is used for overseeding and often becomes an important component of the turf. Triggered by experiences in SW Norway and predictions for milder winters, our objectives were (1) to compare KB sod and PR seed for establishment of football pitches in three climatic regions; and (2) for both types of turf to document the effect of overseeding PR or KB in spring, summer or fall on turf cover, botanical composition, and wear tolerance. Field trials with sodded KB and seeded PR on main plots and overseeding on subplots were conducted from June 2008 to Nov. 2011 at the Bioforsk units Landvik (58 °N, coast), Apelsvoll (61 °N, inland) and Kvithamar (64 °N, coast). Seeded PR plots could be opened to play one month after sodded KB plots. KB survived well at all sites, but complete winterkill of PR occurred in two out of three years at Kvithamar and one out of three years at Apelsvoll. At Landvik one of two main plots with PR died during the last winter. The fact that winterkill was not caused by snow mold but long-lasting ice covers or low freezing temperatures combined with little or no snow cover, shows that a milder but more unstable winter climate will not allow for pure PR pitches in the future. Pitches still ought to have KB in the base, but PR is recommended for overseeding, preferably in spring, to reduce AB ingress and improve turf quality. Overseeding of PR into KB did not outcompete KB, but overseeding of KB into PR or KB was mostly not successful.",

We aimed to compare the occurrence of Brevicoryne brassicae L., its primary parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh) and predators from Coccinellidae and Cecidomyiidae families in non-fertilized, organically (with cow manure) and synthetically fertilized white cabbage crops. Occurrence of B. brassicae was higher on organically fertilized plants. Parasitoid D. rapae had the strongest effect in reducing the aphid population, as other predators occurred only in small densities. Quantity of parasitized aphids by D. rapae was higher on manure fertilized plants. In non-fertilized cabbage plants seasonal parasitization per cent of B. brassicae by D. rapae increased along with the expected lower aphid pressure compared with fertilized plants and reached on average 28.5%. D. rapae reduced the population of cabbage aphid by on average 15.5% in manure fertilized and −12.9% in synthetically fertilized plants. The regression showed a positive relationship between the increase of the number of B. brassicae and activity of D. rapae. No coccinellids were found in aphid colonies on synthetically fertilized plants. Different fertilization did not have any significant effect on the incidence of Aphidoletes aphidimyza Rond. In conclusion, organic fertilization increased the population of cabbage aphid more than its natural enemies and the abundance of natural enemies was too small to provide effective reduction of this pest.",

    "abstract": "To assess emergence time of shoots from roots of the perennial weed Sonchus arvensis as a function of root weight and soil temperature, we performed an experiment to which linear models were fitted. Root parts of three distinct initial weight classes were grown in pots in the dark at constant temperatures of 4, 8 and 18°C, respectively. During five harvest occasions, prior to or at shoot emergence, below-ground shoot length was measured. Root planting depth (3, 10 and 17 cm) did not influence shoot elongation rate. The below-ground shoot elongation rate for a given initial root-weight class was estimated from the observations to be constant with time, but to increase with temperature and initial root weight. By expressing shoot length for a given day as a linear function of the number of days from planting date, and elongation rate as a linear function of temperature, we calculated (1) the accumulated temperature-sum requirement for emergence, (2) emergence time for variable temperature conditions in a clay soil using soil temperature recordings at 5-cm depth for seven seasons in central Sweden and (3) the emergence time at three elevated temperature levels and initial root-weight classes. The accumulated temperature-sum requirements for below-ground shoots of S. arvensis to reach soil surface are independent of temperature regime for roots of a given initial weight but lower for heavier than lighter roots. The temperature limit for below-ground shoot elongation to occur is about 2.0–2.5°C. Between-year variations in temperature under field conditions cause larger variation to emergence time than initial root-weight differences. An average temperature increase of 3°C would cause an earlier emergence time, in the same range (about 2 weeks) as the difference between the earliest and latest year in the current weather conditions.",

Pollination in the wild is accomplished mainly by flies. In most seasons pollination is insufficient leading to poor fruit set and fruit size. Honeybees have been used by cloudberry producers both in Norway and in Finland to increase cloudberry pollination. In a comparative study between four bogs supplied with two honeybee hives and four control bogs without honeybees in north-eastern Québec, Canada, honeybees were shown to collect significant quantities of cloudberry pollen, and pollen loads, fruit set, seed set and cloudberry yields were all significantly increased in bogs with hives compared with those in the control bogs.",

    "abstract": "In order to obtain a high and stable yield of organic spring barley, production should be optimized according to the specific environment. To test the performance of spring barley varieties under varying cropping conditions, a field experiment was carried out in 2003 and 2004 in a six-field mixed organic crop rotation. We investigated the choice of variety, the order in a rotation, and the application of manure (slurry and farmyard manure; 0 to 120 total-N ha−1) on grain yields of six selected varieties with different characteristics grown in either pure stands or in two spring barley mixtures, each consisting of three varieties. Average grain yield of the barley varieties varied between 3.3 t DM ha−1 and 4.1 t DM ha−1. Grain yields of the two mixtures were 4.0 and 3.6 t DM ha−1, respectively. The varieties/mixtures interacted with crop order and year. Foliar diseases were more severe in the barley following grass-clover with large annual differences in the individual diseases. Despite different rooting depths and nutrient uptake patterns, there was no interaction between variety/mixture and the manure input regarding grain yield. In the 1st year after grass-clover, one of the two mixtures gave higher grain yield than the average yield of the individual varieties in the mixture. This was not the case in the 4th year after grass-clover and for the second variety mixture. Thus, although the present results did not indicate that some barley varieties were better adapted to conditions with low manure input than others, variety mixtures that give a robust and stable organic production may potentially be developed.",

Tomato cv. ‘Ikram’ and eggplant cv. ‘Black Bell’ were grafted onto two tomato interspecific hybrids (‘Beaufort’ and ‘He-Man’). Plants were grown in an open soilless cultivation system and supplied with two nutrient solutions: non-saline control and a saline solution (adding 15 mM Na2SO4, 3.7 dS m−1). Plant dry biomass production and partitioning were influenced by salinity, but its effect was depending on the rootstock/scion combination. ‘Beaufort’ eliminated the deleterious effect of salinity when tomato was used as scion, but reduced (−29.6%) the shoot biomass of eggplant. ‘He-Man’ had a different effect on scion growth under saline conditions: shoot biomass was less reduced in eggplant (−20.6%) than in tomato (−26.8%). Under salt stress, ‘Beaufort’ reduced the accumulation of Na+ in tomato leaves more than in eggplant, whereas no differences were observed between tomato and eggplant grafted onto ‘He-Man’. Stem Na+ accumulation followed a different pattern. The increase of Na+ in the stems was similar for tomato and eggplant grafted onto ‘Beaufort’, whereas stems of tomato accumulated more Na+ compared to eggplant grafted onto ‘He-Man’. The opposite response of the tested rootstocks to salt stress when the scion was either tomato or eggplant seems to be partially related to the capacity of the rootstock and scion to exclude Na+ from the shoot. However, the results of nutrient accumulation within plant tissues imply that other mechanisms in addition to ion competition are involved in the salt resistance of grafted plants.",

We determined the impact of soil moisture and soil P-supply on the responsiveness to foliar P-application under controlled environmental conditions. Plant dry matter yields, P-accumulation and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) with or without foliar application were determined at five soil P-levels in combination with two soil moisture levels. The results suggest that water status is of importance for the responsiveness to foliar P-application and may be related to diffusion of P through the leaf cells, which require a good water status. The PUE was significantly improved with irrigation while adding P to the soil decreased the PUE.",

    "abstract": "Leaching losses of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) from arable land can be high, with N and P contributing significantly to the eutrophication of lakes and coastal waters. This study examined whether agriculture management and drain repair changed the chemical properties of shallow groundwater and affected nutrient leaching in the field. The hydrology of a subsurface-drained agricultural observation field included in the Swedish water quality monitoring programme was simulated for the period 1976–2006 using the process-based, field-scale model DRAINMOD. On the assumption that the drainage system operated similarly before and after repair, 54% more water was assigned to low-moderate flow events. Measured concentrations of sulphate-sulphur (SO4-S), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl) and potassium (K) were significantly lower in shallow groundwater in the period before drainage system repair (1980–1998) than afterwards (1998–2010). The concentrations were also significantly correlated with the corresponding concentrations in near-simultaneously sampled drain water. A similar connection was not observed for Na and Cl in the period before drain repair. Elevated concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) were recorded both in shallow groundwater and in drainage water from 1998 to 2010, especially after incorporation of chicken manure into the soil in 1998. Based on simulated discharge (assuming a functioning measuring station throughout), estimated flow-weighted mean NO3-N concentration in drainage water increased from 5.6 mg L−1 (1977–1998) to 15.7 mg L−1 in the period 1998–2000. Simultaneously, mean NO3-N concentration in shallow groundwater increased from 0.2 to 4.0 mg L−1, and then to 4.8 mg L−1 in the period 2000–2012. It was estimated that after drain repair, a greater proportion of infiltrated NO3-N entered the receiving stream directly via the outlet of the tile drainage system close to the field's monitoring station than was the case before repair.",

    "abstract": "Studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and stability require the separate assessment of soil fractions in relation to protection against loss. This on-farm study assessed the role of primary (sand, silt, and clay) and secondary (micro- and macroaggregates) particle size fractions on the physical protection of SOC to 30-cm depth of nine agricultural and three forest land uses within three contrasting ecoregions of Costa Rica (i.e., Isthmian-Atlantic moist, Pacific dry, and Montane forest). Specific objectives were to: (1) determine the effect of land use in each ecoregion on particulate organic matter carbon (POM-C), silt plus clay-associated carbon (S+C-C), and micro- and macroaggregate associated water-stable aggregate carbon (WSA-C), and (2) establish the relationships among aggregate properties and SOC concentration. Aggregate stability was characterized by studying the WSA, mean weight diameter (MWD), and tensile strength (TS). Soils under coffee (Coffea arabica), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), and pineapple (Ananas comosus) plantations had high clay contents to 30-cm depth (ranging between 42.9 and 60.7%), which indicated a high potential for SOC storage. In comparison to less disturbed forest soils, micro- and macroaggregation was not strongly affected by agricultural land use. At coffee and pasture land uses, POM-C concentration was significantly lower (ranging between 0.4 and 2.0 g C kg−1). Between 58 and 98% of SOC was associated with S+C fractions indicating the importance of these particle size fractions to SOC storage. The S+C-C and micro- and macroaggregate-C concentrations differed mainly among pineapple, mango (Mangifera indica), pasture, and other land uses within ecoregions. Further, there was no general tendency of higher C concentrations in the macro- vs. the microaggregate fractions in contrast to the aggregate hierarchy theory. The MWD was affected by land use only for pineapple and organic farming, and it decreased for mango and coffee with increase in soil depth. Correlations among SOC, texture, and TS were site-specific. Silt content was more important than the other particle size fractions in explaining SOC contents. In summary, the amount of physically separated soil fractions and their C storage and stability to 30-cm depth differed mainly among pineapple, mango, pasture, and coffee in specific ecoregions. Well-designed long-term field experiments in Costa Rica are needed to develop management practices for enhancing SOC storage and stabilization in physically separated soil fractions.",

    "abstract": "Artificial subsurface drainage systems are a common water management practice to remove excess water from agricultural land in the Baltic and Nordic countries. Unfortunately, these systems also serve as nutrient transport pathways from agricultural fields to downstream waterbodies. The objective of this study was to determine the status of subsurface drainage water in the context of implementation of the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) and EU Nitrate Directive (ND), to investigate the impact of hydrology and mineral fertilizer application on nutrient losses through subsurface drainage systems and to evaluate the possible effects of climate change on drainage and nutrient loss. This research was conducted from 1995 through 2013 at the agricultural run-off–monitoring sites in Berze and Mellupite. Continuous-flow measurement data and composite water samples were collected on a monthly basis for assessment of total nitrogen (TN), nitrate–nitrogen (NO3–N) and total phosphorus (TP) in drainage water. Results from the study indicated that the mean annual NO3–N concentration was slightly below the threshold level defined by ND, while TN concentrations exceeded the threshold level for good chemical status of water according to WFD. Differences in TN losses were mainly driven by the hydrologic behaviour at the study sites rather than by mineral fertilizer application rates, whereas TP losses under similar application rates were affected by open inlets for surface water accumulation. The comparison of meteorological data for the research period (1995–2013) with the long-term mean (1950–1994) showed a pronounced evidence of climate change. The mean annual precipitation amount has increased at both Berze and Mellupite monitoring sites by 36 mm and 42 mm, respectively, compared to the long-term mean for 1950–1994. Meanwhile, the mean annual temperature during the research period was 7.3°C for Berze and 6.4°C for Mellupite, which is 1.4°C and 0.6°C warmer than long-term mean.",

Cucumis species had smaller stem diameters at the graft union, whereas Citrullus had bigger ones. The objective of the study was to improve inter-generic graft compatibility of Citrullus and Cucumis through optimizing the sizes of stem diameters during grafting. Cucumis species were raised in a 160-hole seedling tray and primed seeds of Citrullus were raised in a 200-hole seedling tray seven days after emergence of Cucumis in order to reduce the stem diameters. At grafting, stem diameter ratios in various treatments were equal to one, whereas at 66 days after grafting the ratios were grater than one, with the exception of those of intact plants. Survival of grafts from grafting to 66 days after grafting was 100%, translating into relative improvement of 186%. Improved survival of grafts would invariably promote the potential uses of inter-generic grafting among wild and cultivated watermelon in management of soil-borne pathogens.",

The results showed that the cultivation periods had no significant impact on the SOC contents in the top horizons of the paddy fields after 50 years of rice cultivation. The SOC contents below the depth of approximately 40 cm for the older paddy soils were higher in comparison to paddy soils cultivated for 50–500 years. SR was the ratio of the SOC density in the 0–40 cm layer to that in the 40–80 cm layer. Across the chronosequence, SR values of the paddy fields decreased as the rice cultivation periods increased in duration. The difference in δ13C between the bottom layers and topsoil decreased as the duration of the cultivation periods increased. Below the soil depth of about 60 cm, the difference in δ13C between SOC and the rice-derived residue also decreased as the duration of the cultivation periods increased. The C/N ratios at the depth of approximately 40–60 cm began to increase gradually with the duration of rice cultivation periods after 500 years of rice cultivation. The changes in SR, δ13C and C/N ratios in soil profiles indicated that long-term rice cultivation is able to cause weakly decomposed and low δ13C rice-derived organic carbon to be accumulated in subsoil. Increasing amounts of organic carbon were sequestrated in the subsoil as the duration of the rice cultivation periods increased. These findings support the fact that paddy soils cultivated for hundreds to thousands of years were still potential C sequestrators.",

Three-week-old plants at the 4-leaf stage were exposed to salinity by application of 0, 50 and 100 mM NaCl for 14 days. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) along with changes in the accumulation of proline, lipid peroxidation and chlorophyll content in leaves were estimated. Salinity induced obvious changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation, proline accumulation and chlorophyll content in the leaf tissues. Exogenous application of AsA (5 and 10 mM) to stressed plants resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in APX activity and reduction in the activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT and POX) as well as a decrease in the contents of stress-induced proline and malondialdehyde (MDA). Higher chlorophyll content was also recorded in stressed plants using AsA. The inherent capability of AsA to scavenge free radicals may have assisted the plant using the lower oxidative damages. The results of this study showed that AsA treatment would reduce the deleterious effects of salt-induced oxidative stress and improve plant tolerance to salt stress.",

However, data on mineral uptake with maturity are not available for a larger majority of wild vegetables. S. nigrum, one of the popular wild vegetables consumed in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, was cultivated both on the field and glasshouse to gain a better understanding of the uptake of some macrominerals as the plant matures. Five treatments (control; 100 kg N/ha; 8.13 t manure/ha; 100 kg N/ha + 8.13 t manure/ha and 50 kg N/ha + 4.07 t manure/ha) were set up in a Randomised Complete Block Design in both trials.

K (%) ranged between 3.11–6.98 in the glasshouse and 3.88–6.98 on the field; Ca (%) between 1.23–3.72 in the glasshouse and 1.39–3.98 on the field; Mg (%) between 0.31–0.93 in the glasshouse and 0.48–0.82 on the field; P (mg/kg) between 0.23–0.80 in the glasshouse and 0.29–0.77 on the field and Na (mg/kg) ranged between 749–3070 in the glasshouse and 187–3070 on the field. The application of 50 kg N/ha + 4.07 t manure/ha increased the uptake of a majority of the minerals. K, P and Na decreased with maturity while Ca increased and Mg varied. Although the current results indicate that for K, P and Na nutritional interventions, the leaves of S. nigrum are best harvested during the early phase of growth and the final phase for Ca, the concentration of these minerals has the potential to supply sufficient quantities of the minerals in human physiology at all stages of the plant's growth. This wild vegetable is therefore recommended for both consumption and cultivation.",

    "abstract": "Poor maintenance of drainage systems has been identified as one of Swedish agriculture's weak points, as impaired land drainage can lead to major environmental problems. Drain maintenance work is receiving increasing attention in work conducted within the European Union Water Framework Directive. Moreover, the functionality and maintenance of agricultural ditches will need to be improved to cope with predicted higher pressures on water infrastructure in a future climate. In Sweden, ditch maintenance work is mandatory, but must be carried out with great consideration for the environment. There is currently no simple method available in Sweden for assessing the comprehensive status of open drainage ditches and determining whether remedial measures are needed. This study tested an on-site method, Minnesota Agricultural Ditch Research Assessment for Stability, for evaluating the status of drains and the need for improvements. The study also included an evaluation of physical ditch properties that can be assessed visually on-site and the processes they represent. The results showed that it is viable to evaluate ditch properties such as bank stability, erosion and deposition susceptibility visually on-site. However, more intensive surveys are needed to identify the processes affecting bank stability. For assessing how improvement of drain status affects bank stability and hydraulic properties, Hydrologic Engineering Centre's River Analysis System simulations can be a useful tool when complemented with updated cross-section measurements and existing documentation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this work was to test whether a dynamic soil C and N model using site-specific information improved estimates of apparent net N mineralization compared with regressions only based on static soil properties. This comparison was made using data from a 34-point sampling grid within a Swedish arable field during two growing seasons, using a simple carbon balance and nitrogen mineralization model (ICBM/N) for the dynamic approach. Three free model parameters were simultaneously optimized using non-linear regression to obtain the best model fit to the data from all grid points and both years. Calculated annual mean net mineralization (Nm_sim) matched the measured Nm mean exactly, and was 44 and 71 kg N ha−1 for the two growing seasons 1999 and 2000, respectively. However, the variability in calculated Nm_sim values among the 34 grid points was smaller than that measured, and only a small proportion of the variation within a single year was explained by the model. Despite this, the model explained 56% of the total variation in Nm during the two growing seasons, mainly due to the good fit to the seasonal overall difference. Significant factors influencing net mineralization included the soil environment controlling mineralization, total N in soil organic matter and N in crop residues. Uncertainties in estimation of θ fc and θ wp (soil water content at saturation and wilting point) and the possible influence of unknown horizontal and vertical water flows made high-precision calculations of soil water content difficult. The precision and general applicability of the actual measurements thus set limits for estimating critical parameters, and the limitations of both the experimental design and the model are discussed. It is concluded that improvements in precision in sampling and analysis of data from the grid points are needed for more critical hypothesis testing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sugar beet accumulates a significant amount of Na, which affects both yield of storage root and its technical quality. So far there has not been developed a scientific basis of fertilizer Na recommendation. In order to solve this problem, in 2003 and 2004 series of field trials were carried in commercial farms out to determine the response of sugar beet to Na application. The experiments were established in 20 fields differing in soil Na concentration. Each trial consisted of control (NPK) and a plot with 50 kg Na ha−1 (NPK + Na). Soil samples were collected at two depths (0.0 – 0.3 m and 0.3 – 0.6 m) at spring, before the application of Na. The increase of beet yield (BY) varied from −0.8 to 15.1% compared with the control and averaged at 4.9%. The plants fertilized with Na showed lower sucrose concentration (ca−0.21% fresh matter) and higher root Na concentration (ca +0.65 mM kg−1 fresh matter) compared with the control. The relative increase of white sugar yield (WSY) varied from − 3.5 to 14.1% and was field specific. The effect of Na application on BY and quality depended on the level of plant-available Na. Its impact on WSY was modified by the content of exchangeable K. The highest WSY increase was observed both on Na-poor soils (<6 mg kg−1) and also on soils with K/Na ratio higher than 15–20:1. This study indicates that the diagnosis of plant-available Na content should include both the top- and subsoil. The highest WSY increase resulting from the plant's response to fertilizer Na should be expected on soils with ready-for-use Na content below 60 kg ha−1 within the layer 0.0–0.6 m. In addition, the rate of fertilizer Na for these soils should not exceed 90 kg ha−1.",

When expressing GNA at relatively high levels such potatoes may have a negative effect on the fecundity and development of the first generation of the important pest, the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). However, the effects on M. persicae over several generations, and how such plants affect the alate aphids' colonization behaviour have not been reported. In this laboratory study, the performance of single M. persicae on potatoes with low GNA expression, measured as developmental time, fecundity, size and survival, was compared with the control, following two successive generations of single apterous aphids. Aphid population growth on the two plant lines was also studied. In addition, colonization behaviour was investigated in a choice experiment where the alate aphids could choose between the GNA and an isogenic control potato plant in a cage. The present study showed that the apterous aphid performance was not significantly different on the two potato lines, although the aphids tended to perform slightly poorer on the transgenic potato. However, the transgenic potato was less likely to be colonized by alate aphids. It is concluded that such transgenic potato plants expressing the lectin at a relatively low level, maximum 0.2% of the soluble protein, have no significant impact on the performance of apterous M. persicae once on the plant, but may have a potential in controlling the aphids by altering the colonization behaviour of alates.",

The diversity (H’) of crops in arable land in the Kujawy and Pomorze Province ranges from 1.68 to 2.54. The diversity of crop plantations in the region was bigger in the communes in which there are: better soil, a higher share of arable land in the agricultural acreage and cropland in the arable land as well as with a higher share of barley, corn for grain and sugar beet in the cropland structure. The highest dominance index (λ) for crops in the whole province is 0.291. The index of dominance of agricultural crops in this region increases with an increase in the share of: woodland in the total area, meadows and pasture in the agricultural acreage and rye in the cropland structure.",

Four combinations of plant density and N fertilizer were evaluated. Plant height, length and diameter of each internode, stem cortex and pith thickness, breaking weight and stem strength were measured. When plant density and N fertilizer increased, stem strength decreased, but the combined effect of these two factors was higher than when applied separately. The cultivar which performed the best in all treatments was a double haploid which expressed the solid stem trait for all internodes. Cultivars and hybrids with normal stems performed the poorest. Breaking weight was positively correlated with stem strength for all four treatments. Shorter internodes caused stronger stems. Stem cortex thickness was also positively correlated with stem strength for all the treatments. This shows that the thicker the stem cortex and the thicker the pith, the stronger the stem of the plant.",

Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. ‘Barball’) (L) was used as control. The seeds were sown in October in 2005 and 2006 in southwest Iran with a dry and moderate climate. The experiment was conducted in a split-plot design with year as main plot and turfgrass types as subplot. The cultures were maintained as lawns and were mowed from 3 cm above the ground. The turfgrasses were compared by measuring visual quality after winter and summer, chlorophyll index after winter and summer, rooting depth, verdure and root fresh weight, tiller density, and clippings fresh weight. Poa monoculture had high tiller density, root fresh weight and total fresh weight. Lolium monoculture had high rooting depth after winter and clippings fresh weight. Cynodon monoculture quality was poor with regard to many characters, mainly due to fall sowing. The seed mixture composed of 40% Cynodon+60% Poa was the best treatment and resulted in the highest verdure fresh weight, chlorophyll index after winter and summer, visual quality after winter and summer, and established a good turf according to the other characters. This mixture can be used as an alternative in overseeding programmes in areas with soil and environmental conditions similar to the present research site.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inadequate supply of nitrogen (N) fertilizers results in lower N use efficiency (NUE) and higher N losses which cause environmental deterioration, such as nitrate pollution of groundwater and emission of nitrous greenhouse gases. One way to increase NUE is to use N-efficient cultivars, which grow better under reduced N supplies. Both elite inbred lines and landraces are the basis for hybrid breeding in maize. While inbred lines are mostly selected from high N input conditions, landraces are historically distributed in poor soils with low N availability. Therefore, some potential NUE-related traits conserved in the landraces may have been lost during modern breeding processes. In the present study, the N accumulation and utilization efficiency of 15 elite inbred lines and four landraces of maize were compared at low (LN) and high N (HN) input conditions. In general, the grain yields of the inbred lines and the landraces were similar at both N rates. However, nitrogen accumulation ability in landraces was much higher than that of the inbred lines. The high N accumulation of landraces was closely related to their higher biomass, indicating that growth potential is the main driving force for N accumulation. Nevertheless, N utilization efficiency (grain produced per unit N absorbed) of the landraces was significantly lower than that in inbred lines. Correspondingly, assimilation allocation for grain formation, as indicated by the harvest index, was much lower in landraces than in inbred lines. The higher growth potential, and hence, the ability of N accumulation in landraces may be a valuable trait in breeding programs aiming to further improve N use efficiency.",

Data and information on spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC), current practices that could enhance climate adaptation including management of organic resources were collected through biophysical assessments and snap community surveys. Even though homestead fields were more frequently cultivated, higher amounts of SOC (15 ± 2 g kg−1) were observed in homesteads when compared to the periphery cropped sections in bushes (SOC = 9 ± 1 g kg−1). Possibly, a combination of household wastes, droppings of domestic animals that are mostly reared in a free-range system, manures applied to crops and cultural norms of chieftaincy, which cause short-term fallowing of homestead fields could account for the differences in SOC. Use of organic resources for soil amendment among farmers was low (31% of interviewed farmers) due largely to ignorance of fertilizer values of manures and residues, traditions for bush-burning and competing use of organic resources for fuels. Our findings suggest a need for effective management practices, training and awareness aimed at improving management of organic resources and, consequently, increasing SOC and resilience to climate-change-induced risks.",

Large variation in gluten quality was observed from field trials with Norwegian winter wheat conducted in several locations between 2005 and 2013. Moreover, extremely poor gluten quality was observed in several locations in the 2007 and 2011 season, and indicated almost complete loss of breadmaking quality. To investigate the environmental factors which cause extremely weak gluten, gluten proteins were characterized in samples selected within the 2011 season. The results revealed that the proportion of large glutenin polymers decreased in wheat samples with extremely weak gluten. Moreover, re-polymerization of large glutenin polymers, which normally occur during the resting period of a dough, did not take place in gluten prepared from these samples. Incubation of total proteins extracted from these samples in an in vitro system showed a drastic degradation of gluten proteins indicating protease activities. The origin of the proteases remains unclear; however, exogenous proteases derived from Fusarium spp. seem to play a key role for protein degradation, and thus causing severe quality deficiency. A genotypic difference was found between the two cultivars and one of them had higher resistance against the factors influencing gluten quality in negative way.",

The cultivation of medicinal plants, such as Aloe vera, might be an alternative for the saline water use and salt-affected soils occupation. Aloe vera, commonly known as aloe, is one of the primary medicinal plants with multipurpose applications going from pharmaceutical to cosmetic aspects with a promising economic return. Aloe plants were cultivated and irrigated, for 14 months, with drinking water (C0) and with two levels of salt (C1 and C2). Changes in growth, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid peroxidation and phenolic compounds were examined in leaves at harvest. Depressive effects of salt irrigation on the plant growth parameters and a perturbation in inorganic ion contents were found especially with a high level of salt in the irrigation water. The intracellular oxidative stress was evaluated with the H2O2 production. Our results showed that the H2O2 content increased with the accumulation of the toxic ion (Na) in the leaf tissues. In addition, lipid peroxidation, measured by the malondialdehyde (MDA) level, increased as well with salt augmentation in the irrigation water. In response to salt stress, Aloe leaves showed a significant increase in the levels of phenolic compounds too. These results suggest that Aloe can be planted in soils affected by salinity and irrigated with salt water at least at a moderate concentration used in the present study.",

It has been shown to be reliable and of value in exploring relationships between textural properties, damage rates, and storability of varieties. In this paper, a methodology for the assessment of textural properties in-field, prior to harvest, using an inexpensive handheld penetrometer is examined. Three sugar beet varieties were grown in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden during 2019. Textural properties were assessed in-field with the handheld penetrometer 2, 1 and 0 months prior to harvest, and with the laboratory penetrometer directly after harvest. Comparison of the results showed generally strong correlations. A power analysis suggests a difference in mean Handheld Pressure of 0.10 MPa could be found significant within a large trial with a block design. The reliability of the handheld penetrometer was further assessed in the Swedish national variety trials over three years (2019-2021). Correlation coefficients of 0.86 and 0.94 were found between mean Handheld Pressure for 2019 and 2020, and 2020 and 2021 respectively. The handheld penetrometer can be applied as an economic means of quantifying differences in textural properties of sugar beet varieties. Clear operating procedure and training must exist.",

In this study, assessment potential of different existing measurement methods (plant height, Dualex 4 Scientific leaf-clip meter, GreenSeeker handheld crop sensor, drone-acquired orthomosaic calculation, yield, nutrient analysis and nodule assessment) were compared across 12 inoculation treatments applied to lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) at 3 sites. F-values were used to compare the potential of different methods to separate inoculation treatments. The handheld GreenSeeker measuring normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the greatest potential for separating inoculation treatments in fields where lucerne had not previously been cultivated, followed by visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) and green-red vegetation index (GRVI) from drone-acquired orthomosaics. These methods are non-destructive, low cost, require low labour input, fast, and do not require sample preparation, and thus are efficient measurement methods for disaggregating treatments in field inoculation experiments.",

Understanding of the genetic diversity of the species is fundamental to design appropriate conservation and management strategies. The present study addressed the genetic diversity of sorghum accessions collected from major growing regions of Ethiopia. Eighty sorghum accessions representing five populations namely Amhara, Dire Dawa, Oromia, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP) and Tigray were analyzed with 11 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was conducted to evaluate genetic variation within and among populations. The unweighted neighbour-joining-based cluster analysis, principal components of analysis (PCoA) and structure analysis were done to elucidate clustering of populations. The polymorphic information contents (PIC) ranges from 0.50 to 0.86. A high within-populations genetic diversity was confirmed with gene diversity values ranging from 0.51 to 0.77. AMOVA revealed 93.26% of the total genetic variation within populations and 6.74% among populations. Cluster analyses did not show clear grouping of accessions according to their geographical origins, confirming gene flow (Nm = 6.65) among populations. In conclusion, the SSR markers used were polymorphic and highly informative Oromia and Amhara populations displayed genetic diversity greater than mean value of 0.67 suggesting possible target populations for breeding and conservation.",

Small heaps of manure (400 g) were placed in open cylinders outdoors and samples (five replicates) were taken on 12 occasions from December 2020 to May 2021. The samples were analysed for weight, dry matter content and concentrations of total nitrogen (N), ammonium N, total phosphorus (P), water-extractable P (WEP), potassium (K) and carbon (C). There was a fast decline in P and K concentrations and a strong correlation between accumulated precipitation and losses from the manure into the soil. The mean reduction in total-P was 11 mg P kg−1 manure dry weight per mm accumulated precipitation. Manure N was retained in the manure over the five-month period. In conclusion, this study demonstrated high mobility of P and K, indicating a need for strategies for rapid removal of manure from paddocks. Daily removal of manure from paddocks used year-round would, approximately, save 1.7 kg P and 5.5 kg K per horse per year, which could be recycled to replace non-renewable mineral fertilisers.",

Thus, we assess structural sediment connectivity via surface runoff by using a digital elevation model (2 × 2 m2) and RUSLE-based erosion estimates to compute index of connectivity (IC) and sediment delivery estimates. The variables were analyzed within and between two topographically contrasting subcatchments. We found greater spatial variability of IC within a subcatchment than between the subcatchments. The majority of field parcel areas (65%–97%) were structurally connected to adjacent open ditches and streams. Areas with high erosion estimates also tended to be structurally well-connected, both at the pixel (Pearson r = 0.58–0.63) and parcel scale (r = 0.49–0.67). The IC model was not highly sensitive to parameter variations. In contrast, the magnitude of sediment delivery estimates was highly sensitive to parameter variations. However, based on the high rank correlation (Spearman rs > 0.95) between computed sediment delivery estimates, the tool provided consistent information on potentially high sediment delivery areas. More empirical data and dynamic model applications could be applied to improve the accuracy of the estimates. The method provides a feasible tool to generate open data on connectivity.",

The main challenges reported in grazing dairy cows on temporary grasslands on conventional farms were trampling damage and seasonal variations in grass growth, while for organic dairy farmers, the primary challenge was weed control. Only a few farms had grazing on semi-natural grasslands. Future sustainable grazing should focus on optimising grazing strategy in relation to on-farm grazing locations and nutrient supply for high-yielding dairy cows.",

Deer graze on permanent grasslands throughout the year, but the resulting crop loss varies during the growing season. Accounting for three mowings, the quantitative yield loss due to deer grazing totalled 48–52%, or 3.9–4.3 t/ha. Deer had the highest consumption capacity in the spring (first mowing: yield loss of 1.7–1.9 t of air-dried hay/ha), and towards the end of the growing season, consumption decreased (third mowing: loss of 0.9 t/ha). A floristic inventory indicated low species diversity and production in permanent grasslands in SE Slovenia. The crude protein content in unprotected plots was generally greater than that in protected plots, but due to a large quantitative yield loss, the yield of crude protein and net energy for lactation on heavily grazed land were much lower than those on protected land in all mowings. The average additional cost per unit of heavily grazed area ranged from 182 to 344 EUR/ha, and the differences are the result of the different intensities of game grazing in individual locations and grassland production capacities.",

This study aimed to analyze the morpho-physiological traits of kaffir lime in response to defoliation and drought stress. Kaffir lime was subjected to drought, defoliation, and a combination of both arranged in a randomised complete block design. Concerning morphology, defoliated lime produced a new flush that grows like a crown, while drought-treated plants displayed a bent pose with withered, edge-rolled, and drooping leaves. Higher leaf drop incidences were also noticed in drought-stressed plants. A combination of defoliation and drought stress produced severe flushing disruption by reducing 61% flush number, 77% flush fresh weight, and 74% flush dry weight, compared to undefoliated plants in normal irrigated conditions. Regardless of drought stress conditions, leaf production did not show significant differences among all defoliated plants. Defoliated plants maintained their photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency, leading to the absence of bent flush and rolling leaves as morphological markers of drought-treated plants. It is implied that defoliation can be a practical strategy for adapting kaffir lime in a drought environment.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of foliar fertiliser treatments on lentil yield and yield components in a semi-arid region of South-East Anatolia, Türkiye. The control treatment and six foliar treatments were as follows: (i) Control: non-amended control, (ii) Zn: zinc sulphate, (iii) K: potassium sulphate, (iv) Zn + K (zinc sulphate + potassium sulphate), (v) Flo: Florea-UPL (containing boron and molybdenum), (vi) Mac: Macarena-UPL, an organomineral foliar fertiliser and (vii) Flo + Mac. Foliar fertilisers were applied at the first blooming stage of field-grown lentils. Total biomass yield was largely unaffected across treatments except in the K treatment. However, foliar Zn supply was the only treatment that significantly increased grain yield (55% higher), harvest index and total grain N uptake compared to the control, likely due to enhanced translocation of nitrogen-containing assimilates. SPAD values and total N analysis showed that stover N content depleted more rapidly in the Zn treatment than in other treatments during the grain-filling phase. The tested commercial products slightly increased SPAD values, biomass and grain yield. Among the treatments, Zn, as a foliar fertiliser, was the most cost-effective solution for improving grain yield in this region.",

    "abstract": "Within precision agriculture, yield mapping is important in the evaluation of crop management and delineation of management zones. It can also be used to assess within-field yield potential, in order to guide different precision agriculture practices. However, some farmers do not have a yield monitoring system, and some who do may obtain incomplete or erroneous yield data. This study examined the accuracy with which winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield could be mapped in 18 fields in southern Sweden using a simple empirical relationship between Sentinel-2 (ESA, Paris, France) data, vegetation index (VI) maps and combined harvester data collected in nearby fields. The results showed that a decrease in map resolution to 40 m reduced the error in the yield maps obtained. Normalised difference water index (NDWI) was the most efficient VI, while a combination of satellite data from earlier and later plant development (booting and milk development stages) performed slightly better than data for other development stages and combinations. The best-performing model at a within-field scale (40-m resolution) had an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.40 tonnes ha−1 in a leave-one-field-out cross validation. When the prediction model at field-means scale was applied on 69 farms in a 1055 km2 area, MAE was 0.75 tonnes ha−1 when comparing predictions with mean yields reported by farmers in a phone survey. Therefore, if adequate combined harvester and/or mean yield data are available, a modelling framework that translates satellite imagery into yield maps on-the-fly could be made available for different stakeholders via decision support systems for precision agriculture.",

Soil sulphur status ranged from poor/adequate (fine sand) to good (organic soils). Plant growth responses to supplementary sulphur were small, inconsistent and statistically insignificant. The supplementary S-fertilization increased the sulphur content of forage and decreased N/S-ratios at all sites. However, even in low-S fertilized plots the average sulphur content was very seldomly less than 0.2% on a dry matter (DM) basis, which has been assumed to be an adequate concentration in several foreign studies. High N/S ratios (> 14) were rare. The sulphur content of DM depended more significantly on growth stage and grass species than on supplementary sulphur. According to the results of these experiments, NPKS fertilizers contain sufficient amounts of sulphur to ensure both a good quality and a high yield of grass silage.",

Leaching of Cl− was more rapid and that of SO4 2- was delayed relative to the leaching of NO3 −. Rather large negative N balances were obtained, also after over-optimal application rates, and total N content of the soil was reduced.

Sulphate and chloride are more stable in the soil solution as anions. Chloride ions were found to increase the activity of cations in the soil solution and to increase uptake of cations through the entire growth period. Increased absorption of cations increased yield.

Yield and quality of fodder galega were compared with lucerne. The study was based on field experiments in which cutting frequencies and time of first harvest varied. The experiments were conducted from 1989 to 1994 in Denmark. Main results were: (i) annual yield of organic matter, crude protein, and feed units for cattle in whole‐crop spring barley and fodder galega were similar to that of whole‐crop spring barley and lucerne when two cuts were taken in establishment year, and (ii) annual yield of organic matter, crude protein, and feed units for cattle in the years following establishment were higher in lucerne than in fodder galega. The annual yield of fodder galega was greater at two yearly cuts than at three and four yearly cuts, and also greater on sandy loam with a higher water capacity than on fine loamy sand with a lower water capacity. The concentration of crude fibre increased and the concentration of crude protein, digestible organic matter, digestible energy and feed units for cattle decreased when the yield increased by delayed harvest of fodder galega, especially at the first cut. The concentration of ash, crude protein and crude fibre at harvest in the first week of June was similar in lucerne and fodder galega, whereas the concentration of digestible organic matter, digestible energy and feed units for cattle was higher in lucerne than in fodder galega.

The main objective was to analyse the diversity and distribution of these traits on the basis of administrative regions and altitudinal gradients. The Shannon‐Weaver Diversity Index (H') was used to estimate the magnitude of diversity. With the exception of spike density, all characters were polymorphic in all regions and most altitude groups. However, clinal patterns were observed in only a few cases. At the population level, the mean H' varied from completely monomorphic (H' = 0.00) to highly polymorphic (H' = 0.80 ± 0.07). The highest diversity was found in regions with relatively better climatic conditions and in optimal altitude ranges. On country basis, seed colour (H' = 0.98) and spike density (H' = 0.43) displayed the highest and the lowest diversity indices, respectively. Spike density was the only character that exhibited significant differences (P<0.01) both \"between regions\"; and \"between altitude groups\";. Across characters, most of the variance was due to the lowest hierarchy, the \"within‐population\"; component. The \"between region\"; and \"between altitude group\"; variances were significant, but spike density alone was responsible for the differences. The overall mean H' for Ethiopia was 0.77 + 0.09 and did not seem to have reduced appreciably within the past 25 years or so, when compared to previous estimates.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of different nitrogen and irrigation levels on g -glucan content of wheat grain in the years 1998-2000. Experimental design was a split-split, randomized complete block with three replications. Three irrigation levels (0, 75 and 150 mm) and nitrogen rates (0, 50 and 100 kg/ha) were applied in three winter wheat cultivars. Increased levels of applied nitrogen tended to increase grain g -glucan content in 1999. Non-irrigated (I 0 ) cultivars gave the highest g -glucan contents in all treatments (2000). The mean g -glucan values of Bezostaja 1, Gün 91 and Ikizce 96 were 0.615, 0.391 and 0.361% respectively in 1999. In 2000, the mean g -glucan contents of Bezostaja 1, Gün 91 and Ikizce 96 were 0.704, 0.492 and 0.376% respectively. Correlations between g -glucan content and grain yield, protein content, thousand grain weight and gluten content were significant in both years.

Growth analysis was carried out by taking six samples at two-weekly intervals. Area indices of leaves, stems and pods as well as dry matter of plant components were measured. The cultivars showed two different patterns of development and were classified into two groups: old and new cultivars. The first group (Derby and Cyclone) was characterized by short plants, bearing more branches that started branching earlier and on a low position on the stem, while the second group (Gulle and Christa) were characterized by tall plants with thick stems and few branches, starting higher on the stem. Yield could not be directly related to differences in the canopy structure between old and new types. The highest yielding cultivar (Cyclone) belonged to the new category, but the second highest yielding cultivar (Gulle) was of the old type. The study of canopy structure revealed that the pods were distributed evenly on the uppermost branches of the cultivar Cyclone, while for the other cultivars most of the pods were on the main stem, especially in cultivars Gulle and Christa (old group). The cultivars differed significantly in most yield components. In addition to stem and pod development, number of branches and leaf area after anthesis were important characteristics for yield improvement. There were significant differences between cultivars in oil and protein content. Keywords: CompensationDevelopmentHarvest IndexLeaf AreaYield Components",

    "abstract": "Developing new wheat genotypes resistant to phosphate (P) deficiency and responsive to fertilizer P input will be beneficial to increase P use crop efficiency, especially on P deficient calcareous soils. With this objective, a pot experiment, based on a completely randomised design with three replications, was conducted using a P deficient calcareous soil. Twenty different bread and durum wheat genotypes were used, and phosphorus fertilizer as H3PO3 at levels of 0, 40, 80 mg P kg−1 was applied to the pots. After harvest, plant dry matter yield was recorded, and total P concentration in the tops of wheat plants was determined. Changes in the parameter of P efficiency index (EI) were related to plant genotypes and P levels. Differences were observed among the genotypes with regard to their effectiveness in P use under the experimental calcareous soil. Dry matter yields and EI were correlated for the individual wheat genotypes. Four classification terms, ER (efficient-responsive), ENR (efficient non-responsive), IR (inefficient responsive) and INR (inefficient non-responsive) were used to characterize the wheat genotypes both for their resistance to P deficiency and also for their responsiveness to fertilizer P input. Most durum wheat genotypes were charecterized as ENR, whereas most bread wheat genotypes were charecterized as INR and IR for this study. We conclude that Dağdaş-94 (T. aestivum), characterized as ER, and Kızıltan-91 (T. durum), Yılmaz-98 (T. durum), Ankara-98 (T. durum), Selçuklu-97 (T. durum), BDMM-98/11S (T. durum), characterized as ENR, are valuable in future breeding programmes.",

In all the nitrogen-fertilized variants the number of pods per plant, total seed yields per plant and the concentration of crude protein all increased compared to the unfertilized control variant. The highest levels of nitrogen (3 g N per pot) reduced the 1000-seed weight compared to the unfertilized control variant. The total application of 2 g N per pot split into application before sowing (0.5 g N), after emergence (0.5 g N) and during flowering (1 g N) resulted in a highly significant increase in the number of pods per plant (+78%), the 1000-seed weight (+20.1%) and therefore higher seed yields per plant (+139.8%) compared to the control treatment not fertilized with nitrogen. Increasing levels of nitrogen linearly increased the content of crude protein in seeds during harvest from 24.2% to 40.6%, thus increasing the nutritional quality of the seeds.",

We found that the inclusion of vetch seed in cereal seed and increase of its seed density led to considerable decrease in the yield of the cereal component (R=0.980–0.998). The adverse effect of vetch on cereal yield led to a reduction in wheat yield by up to 1861 kg ha−1 on average for the three years, and in oats yield by up to 1413 kg ha−1. One reason for the decreases in cereal yields was the formation of smaller grains in cereals under increased vetch seed densities. As a three-year average, the wheat 1000-seed weight decreased by up to 6.3 g while the corresponding figure for oats under identical conditions was 2.5 g. The inclusion of vetch in a crop and the increase of its seed density led to a substantial increase in the protein content of cereal grains. In oats, the change in grain protein content was smaller. At the same time, the maximum protein yield per area unit in cereals was obtained from their monocultures. In a mix with vetch, the amounts of nitrogen consumed by cereals decreased and protein yield of cereals per area unit reduced at higher vetch seed densities. Vetch-cereal mixes had an advantage over cereal monocultures as far as protein yield was concerned. In vetch-wheat and vetch-oats mixes the maximum protein yield was 500 kg ha−1 and 438 kg ha−1, respectively, on average for the three years. Of the two combinations, vetch-oats mixed crop gave the highest yield of grain, whereas the higher mixed crop yield resulted from the oats component. Oats is somewhat more competitive with vetch than wheat. Vetch-wheat mixed crop gave the highest protein yield because the protein content of wheat grains was higher than oat grains. Legume-cereal mixes are particularly suited for the conditions of organic farming as they ensure a relatively good harvest and a high protein yield.",

A.tenuis Sibth.) ‘Leikvin’ was investigated in 12 on-farm trials laid out according to five different experimental plans in SE Norway from 1993 to 1997. Seed yields on plots sprayed with insecticides were significantly higher than on unsprayed control plots in three out of nine trials; however, these seed yield increases were poorly correlated with silvertop frequencies which varied from 1 to 60% on untreated plots. Differences between various insecticides (two pyrethroids and one organophosphorus compound) and single versus split applications were mostly not significant. While seed yields on plots sprayed with ethephone (‘Cerone’, 0.5 kg a.i. ha−1) were not significantly different from those on unsprayed control plots, chlormequat chloride (‘CCC 750’, 1.0 or 2.0 kg a.i. ha−1 plus surfactant) minimized lodging and increased seed yield by 21% on average for five trials. When chlormequat chloride and the pyrethroid α-cypermethrin were combined in a tank mixture including surfactant at the crop growth stage Z 31-32, the effects of the two products were mostly additive. Based on these results, the application of the growth regulator chlormequat chloride (1.0 kg a.i. ha−1) is now recommended in Norwegian seed production of common bent. Although the effects of insecticides were often not significant, seed growers are further advised to add an insecticide (e.g., α-cypermethrin, 150 g a.i. ha−1) to the growth regulator as a precaution against silvertop, which otherwise seems to appear quite randomly in seed production of common bent.",

Only a few significant differences were observed in the effects of various treatments on flowering, yield, size of berries or vegetative growth of blackcurrant (cv. 'Mortti'). The soluble solids content (Brix) was highest when using solution fertilizers and irrigation threshold of −150 hPa. Based on this study and earlier studies, the optimal soil moisture measured with tensiometer in sandy soils is at least −270 hPa or even more moist. The soil moisture effect depends on soil nutrient status.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is well known that humified soil organic matter (SOM) plays a central role in soil fertility due to its chemical and physical properties, especially by sustaining soil biological and related ecological equilibrium. Soil organic matter quantity and quality needs to be preserved in order to maintain soil productivity. In this study total organic carbon contents and their distribution were determined in several volcanic ash derived soils of Chile. Carbon balances are expressed in terms of a labile fraction (alkali-extractable less than 10.000 Dalton and polysaccharide compounds) and a stable fraction (fulvic, humic and humine compounds). The effects of different agronomic management on soil organic matter (SOM) quality and quantity are estimated and compared between agricultural and virgin forest soil sites. The results indicate that soils under native forest show a C level higher than agricultural soils. After human intrusion the stable C (m.w.>10,000 Daltons), viewed as a measurement of the humification grade, shows a mean value of 70% over the total C and follows the order: ultisols (‘Rojo arcillosos’)>andisols-placandepts (‘Ñadis’)>andisols-distrandepts (‘Trumaos’). C balance demonstrates that in agricultural soils the soluble C, or ‘labile C’ is increased and accounts for 12–30% of the total C; these organic compounds contribute largely to the solubilization, mobility and availability of plant nutrients but also enhance losses of organic carbon by lixiviation. By using the carbon balance methodology discussed in this work, changes of quality and quantity of SOM can be followed up. The SOM of Chilean volcanic soils is being degraded after human intrusion; this needs to be considered in cultivation of these soils in order to preserve their fundamental properties.",

A crop growth model was used to quantify growth potential and to separate the influence of weather variables from factors related to the plant stand. The investigation revealed a high variability in dry matter (DM) production among years during the study period due to weather. There was also found to be a clear seasonal variation. The general shape of the DM production curve, with a rapid spring growth (the maximum relative growth rate (R s )=0.16 g g−1 day−1), a midsummer depression (R s =0.06 g g−1 day−1), and a second peak of growth in late summer (R s =0.09 g g−1 day−1), was the same for all years and for all fields. The model underestimated production when cover of herbs was low in spring and overestimated production when cover of herbs was high in spring. The seasonal and among years variation in DM production entailed a parallel large variability in the numbers of grazing animals (from 11 to 43 heifers ha−1) the area could sustain.",

    "abstract": "Soil phosphorus (P) fractions can be used as indicators for short- and long-term P availability. The labile organic and inorganic P concentrations are critical sources of P in agroecosystems, representing an active reservoir (source and sink) of P. The less available P pools (other than residual P) may be better measures of potentially plant available P, since these pools represent the soil P reservoir that can re-supply labile pools over time. Little information exists on P pools in soil orders under indigenous vegetation in semi-arid climates in Turkey. Our objective was to assess short- and long-term plant availability of P over depth in the soil profile using chemical P fractionation. Soil samples were collected of different horizons in the profile from each of four major soil orders: Mollisol, Entisol, Inceptisol, and Aridisol. Samples were analysed using sequential fractionation to obtain seven P pools. In order of decreasing plant availability the seven pools are: resin extracted inorganic P (resin-Pi), inorganic and organic P extracted by sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3-Pi and NaHCO3-Po), inorganic and organic P extracted by sodium hydroxide (NaOH-Pi and NaOH-Po), sulphuric acid extracted inorganic P (H2SO4-Pi), and P measured by a sulphuric/peroxide digestion (residual-P). Topsoil contained greater amounts than deeper layers for all P fractions except residual-P. Total P levels in Aridisol were considerably higher than in the Mollisol and Inceptisol and lowest in the Entisol. The Mollisol had the highest concentrations of labile inorganic P (sum of resin-P + NaHCO3-Pi). For the surface horizon, labile organic and inorganic P concentrations combined (sum of resin-Pi, NaHCO3-Pi and NaHCO3-Po) were highest in the Mollisol, followed by the Inceptisol and Aridisol with similar levels, and the Entisol with the lowest amount of labile P. Independent of soil order, higher concentrations of NaOH-Po and NaHCO3-Po occurred in the topsoil consistent with greater organic matter levels in the surface horizons. The largest pools of NaOH-Pi and H2SO4-Pi were found in the rooting zones of the Aridisol, followed by the Inceptisol, Mollisol and Entisol. Residual-P amounted to 19–26% of total P in the Mollisol, 32–51% of total P in Aridisol, 30–34% in the Inceptisol and 39–54% in the Entsiol with a higher percentage in the deepest horizons for each of the soil orders. Our results suggest that the readily plant available soil P pools of Mollisol are sufficiently large to support crop production. On the other hand, in the Aridisol, Inceptisol and Entisol the labile P pools are small. In the Aridisol, re-supply from more stable P fractions (NaOH and H2SO4-Pi) might contribute to P availability over time. However, in the Inceptisol and Entisol, re-supply of the labile P fraction from the more stable pools will not be sufficient given small pool sizes, and so regular P applications will be needed to sustain crop production for these soil orders.",

The crop was cultivated under furrow irrigation and subjected to three irrigation regimes in which irrigation was applied when 30, 50 and 70% of the available water holding capacity was consumed, and three irrigation levels (100, 50 and 0% replenishment of soil water depleted). The highest yield and water use was obtained under non-water-stressed treatments (100% replenishment of soil water depleted) for each irrigation regime. The lower (non-stressed) and upper (stressed) baselines were determined empirically from measurements of canopy temperatures, ambient air temperatures and vapour pressure deficit values and the CWSI was calculated with three irrigation levels for each irrigation regime. Trends in CWSI values were consistent with the soil water contents induced by the deficit irrigations. Average CWSI before irrigation values of 0.49 for irrigation when 30% of the available water holding capacity was consumed, 0.55 for irrigation when 50% of the available water holding capacity was consumed and 0.69 for irrigation when 70% of the available water holding capacity was consumed, produce maximum tuber yield. The yield was also directly correlated with seasonal CWSI values.",

Leaves were sampled from the tree branches which were bent in summer 2003 (1 September), in spring 2004 (15 May), and from unbent trees. Samplings were made during the growing season May to October 2004, on the following dates: 1st sampling, 15 May; 2nd sampling, 11 June; 3rd sampling, 9 July; 4th sampling, 6 August; 5th sampling, 2 September; and 6th sampling, 1 October. The leaves contained caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, rutin, epicatechin and catechin. The lowest contents of phenolics were found on the first occasion. After that, in the sequence of sampling dates, an increase was noticed at first, but after reaching their highest point, the contents of phenolics decreased. In most cases fewer contents of phenolic compounds were found in leaves from bent branches (especially from branches bent in summer), and the highest ones in leaves from the control group. For all phenolics, apart from the caffeic and vanillic acids, significant differences were evident among treatments, with the highest contents in the control group and almost the lowest in the summer treatment. It is suggested that the change in branch angle caused the physiological response of pear tree, with different contents of phenolic compounds in its leaves from bent and non-bent branches.",

This study assessed the fate of fertilizer P applied in Quebec Humaquepts. A pot experiment with five textural Humaquepts, each receiving 0 (P0), 10 (P10), 20 (P20) and 40 (P40) mg P kg−1 soil was conducted under barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotations. A modified Hedley procedure was used for soil P fractionation. The clayey soils reached a plateau of dry matter at less P applied than the coarser-textured soils. Plant P uptake, soil labile inorganic P (resin-P + NaHCO3-Pi) and moderately labile inorganic P (NaOH-Pi) increased proportionally with P rate. The coarser-textured soils had lower contents of labile and moderately labile Pi, but a larger increase in labile Pi than the finer-textured soils after receiving P additions. The applied P was retained primarily as soil labile Pi, accounting for 43–69% of total soil recovery of applied P, compared to 20–30% recovered as moderately labile Pi, and 7–29% assumed to be sparingly soluble P (HCl-P + H2SO4-P). The labile Pi recovery of applied P was linearly depressed with clay content, compared to a quadratic relation for the moderately labile Pi recovery. The results suggest the importance of accounting for soil texture along with soil P adsorption capacity when assessing the efficiency of applied P, P accumulation in soils and subsequently P nutrient management.",

Enrichment or depletion of trace elements was assessed using Al, Fe and V (control topsoil and B horizon) as reference elements. We found that various reference elements and selecting reference horizons could give contradictory results and lead to different assessments of the effects of various agricultural practices in Lithuanian soils. Cultivation on naturally acid soils in east and west Lithuania led to enrichment in some trace elements, predominantly Ag, Mn and Sr in sandy loams or loams of west Lithuania and B, Cu and Sr in sandy loams of east Lithuania. Differential fertilization led to Sr accumulation in calcareous silt loams of central Lithuania. Many experiments revealed Sr accumulation, which means that Sr concentrations have profoundly changed during decades of soil fertilization and liming in Lithuanian soils. Subsoil reference indicated a greater number of affected elements in almost all the cases. It is probable that other regional factors (such as atmospheric pollution and precipitation chemistry) influence differences in enrichment factors (EFs) between topsoils and subsoils. Research findings accord with earlier published results on changes of mobile element forms after liming and adds knowledge on the total amounts of affected elements. We suggest that assessment protocols using a few reference elements and soil layers allow filtering of datasets and indicate reliable changes in enrichment factors (EFs). However, changes occurred in other specific elements in specific circumstances, and these reference elements merit special attention. Reference selection procedures also merit further investigation and discussion.",

White clover plants (cv Snowy) were studied in a pot experiment in the field on the coast of northern Norway from spring 2001 until spring 2002. The experiment was repeated with some modifications from spring 2002 until spring 2003. During the growing season from summer to autumn, the plants were totally stripped of leaves down to the stolon, cut at four or seven cm height or left undisturbed. The plants were sampled destructively in autumn, early spring and late spring and sorted into leaves, stolons and roots. The plant material was weighed and analysed for carbohydrate reserves and nodule number. Defoliation during the growing season resulted in reduced concentration of reserve carbohydrates in autumn and reduced winter survival of the stolons. The most severe defoliation treatment reduced the herbage growth in spring. In contrast, the two milder defoliation treatments had no effect on herbage growth during spring or on total plant dry matter and nodule status in late spring. In conclusion, moderate defoliation during the growing season had no effect on herbage growth the following spring nor on carbohydrate, nodule or dry matter status of the plant in late spring. Moderate defoliation increased spring growth and thereby also the nitrogen demand of the plants. This probably enhanced nodule formation and development of inactive to active nodules.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The greatest barrier to the use of oat as an animal feed is its high hull content. In spite of its excellent fat and amino acid composition in animal feed use, as far as nutritional value is concerned, the total energy yield of oat is weaker than that of other cereals because of the hulls which have an energy yield like that of straw, so the use and cultivation of oat has remained behind that of plants richer in energy. There are two ways to improve the low energy yield from the cultivation of oat: one is to cultivate naked oat (naked oat, also referred to as hulless oat, describes a variety of oat that with a caryopsis threshes free from maternal lemma and palea under normal mechanical harvest) and the other way is to cultivate high-yielding conventional oat and dehull it mechanically after threshing.The analysis in this paper is based on economic comparisons related to cultivation, dehulling, and crop value. The results show that the main differences in cultivation costs between naked and conventional oat lie in the amount of seeds required and the drying costs. The main differences affecting the economic result lie in market prices, yield level, and feed value. The results indicate that naked oat is financially more profitable than conventional oat, when the crop is sold at a specific price at all yield levels, when the crop is used as feed at the highest yield level. At lower yield levels, conventional oat is, in spite of its lower feed value, the more profitable option for feed use. Dehulled oat, however, did not achieve the same economic result as naked oat at any yield level, as the cost of dehulling, including disposing of the hull waste, was considerable.",

However, due to the many intermediate links in procurement, high cold chain logistics costs, and poor inventory management efficiency, the operating efficiency of China's fresh food e-commerce has always been at a low level. In the context of the internet, this article constructs three new business models for fresh food e-commerce, including pre-sales models, vertical logistics models, and value proposition models. Authority support policies should be strengthened and expenditure in agricultural research should be increased. At the very same time, the rate of domestic online sales is steadily growing, primarily due to the continued rise of online web users. A good client base for fresh food suppliers has been laid by fast broadband penetration rates.

Three ratios of substitutive oat–pea intercrops were tested on a fertile soil in eastern Austria with application of a low nitrogen (N) fertiliser rate (6 g N m−2) versus an unfertilised control to assess the effect of intercropping and low N fertilisation on dinitrogen fixation (NFIX). The above-ground dry matter (AGDM) and N yield of intercrops increased with N fertilisation, but the increase occurred only in oat, while pea was not affected by N fertilisation. Pure pea stands and intercrops with high pea share resulted in N sparing in the soil at harvest, as the soil mineral N was higher than in pure oat. Half of the applied amount of N was recovered by the AGDM of crops and half remained in the soil at harvest. The NFIX per unit area was highest in pure pea. Intercropping considerably reduced NFIX, especially in intercrops with low pea share. NFIX per unit of AGDM of pea, however, was neither affected by intercropping nor by N fertilisation. Consequently, a low amount of N fertilisation of oat–pea intercrops on a fertile soil can increase overall performance of the system through increasing the performance of oat without impairing that of pea.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the agronomic response and economic return of wheat grown in compacted and non-compacted soils to represent the conditions of non-controlled (non-CTF) and controlled traffic (CTF) systems, respectively. Yield-to-nitrogen responses were derived after application of urea, DMPP-treated urea, and UAN at rates between 0 and 300 kg ha−1 N. Soil properties were measured to guide parametrisation of APSIM, which was used to assess long-term (50 years) effects of CTF and non-CTF soil conditions on crop productivity, rainfall-use efficiency (RUE) and surface runoff. Grain yield and yield components were significantly higher in CTF compared with non-CTF. When N inputs were optimised, N use efficiency (NUE) was more than double in CTF (≈23%) compared with non-CTF (≈9%). RUE was about 15% higher in CTF, which concurrently reduced the amount of surface runoff compared with non-CTF. For years with average rainfall (240-mm in-crop), yield penalties of up 12% may be expected in non-CTF. APSIM simulations showed that increased productivity, and inter-annual yield stability, can increase gross margin of wheat by AUD30-50 ha−1 depending on in-crop rainfall and the tillage method used. In non-CTF systems, improvements in NUE and RUE are constrained by soil compaction. Enhanced efficiency fertilizers cannot compensate for other stresses caused by compaction and therefore cannot achieve the same NUE and RUE as the CTF system. Adoption of CTF in water-constrained environments improves profitability and resource-use efficiency.",

One of the most prominent factors that affects food production is climate change, which is mainly caused by carbon emissions. The knowledge of the impact of climate change on food production is important in terms of food policies and awareness regarding the issue. The purpose of this study was to empirically investigate the way in which climate change impacts edible food production in 12 selected countries as they had the highest carbon emissions during the 1995–2014 period. Unlike previous studies in the literature, we employ a food production index as an indicator of food production that does not include products such as coffee and tea, which are not nutritious. Further, we investigate the effects of climate change both statically and dynamically. We also do not focus on any specific country or food, as done by many studies in the literature. The results revealed that climate change adversely affects food production, with the production of edible food decreasing with the increase of climate change/carbon emissions.",

This study was conducted to determine if radicle area could be used as a quantitative test for screening the vigor of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seeds. 'SPP7117' pepper seeds were primed with a synthetic calcium silicate (MicroCel E) and water at 30° C for five days. Seeds were aged for 0, 7, 14, and 21 d at 42° C and 95% relative humidity. Primed and nonprimed vigor was evaluated by radicle area as well as germination and emergence characteristics. Excised radicles were incubated at 25° C and visible area was recorded in the range of 6–96 h. The results showed that seed priming significantly increased final radicle area, while aging decreased it compared with nontreated control. A 48-h incubation period of excised radicles at 25° C was found to be sufficient to differentiate seed vigor in primed or aged pepper seeds. Furthermore, radicle area showed a strong positive correlation with final germination of control (R 2=0.89) and primed (R 2=0.98) seeds. These results suggest that radicle area is an effective technique and can be used for judging the quality of pepper seeds.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the amount of soluble organic and inorganic nitrogen pools extracted by water, salt solutions, and centrifugal-drainage technique from different horticultural management system soils. Approximately 5.4–16.6, 4.4–46.5, 7.1–18.2, 8.8–27.8, 1.8–5.6, and 1.7–4.4 mg kg − 1 soluble organic nitrogen were obtained by 1M KCl, 0.5M K2SO4, 10 mM CaCl2, 1/15 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), water, and centrifugal-drainage technique, respectively, in the 0–20 cm horticultural soils. Large variation in soluble organic nitrogen pools was observed across the sites in the present study and the volumes of soluble organic nitrogen pools generally followed the order: organic production system soil > conventional production system soil > transitional production system soil. In relative contrast to soluble organic nitrogen, organic management, known primarily for the absence of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, resulted in significantly lower levels of both soluble inorganic nitrogen and total soluble nitrogen in the soil. The degree of soluble inorganic nitrogen recovery appears highly dependent on the different chemical extractants and generally followed the series: phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) > KCl≈K2SO4 > CaCl2 > water > centrifugal-drainage technique. The soluble organic carbon and nitrogen in all soil extracts were all positively related to soil total carbon, total nitrogen, and electric conductivity value. This suggested that soil total carbon and nitrogen played a central role in the retention of soluble organic nitrogen in soils. Further studies on investigating the soluble organic nitrogen degradation pathway and its bottleneck are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Western Bhutan, a traditional mixed farming system is practised with integration of both livestock and crops. Irrigated highland rice (Oryza sativa L.) is grown in terraced bunds by smallholder farmers for household consumption, with farmyard manure as the main source of nutrient input. The study objectives were to evaluate the rice productivity of the existing farming system, assess the potential of improved cultivars and nitrogen input, and their economic analyses. On-farm trials were carried out in 17 farmers' fields with one traditional and two improved cultivars of rice at 0 and 60 kg nitrogen ha−1 in two highland rice-growing districts. Across locations, environmental index varied from 2.9–6.3 Mg ha−1, exhibiting significantly wide differences in grain yield within and across village clusters. Soil properties were highly variable and soil organic matter was relatively high among the locations. Timely transplanting and small farm size had positive effects on grain yield. Significant effects of location, nitrogen, genotype, and environmental index×nitrogen were recorded on grain yield and total dry matter. Nitrogen fertilizer increased grain yield by 790–840 kg ha−1 in improved cultivars compared with the traditional cultivar (530 kg ha−1). Significant cultivar effects on grain yield were recorded with improved cultivars yielding 670–980 kg ha−1 more than the traditional cultivar due to higher harvest index (13–22%) and agronomic efficiency in nitrogen use (59%). Environmental index×nitrogen indicated significant difference in nitrogen response across the range of environmental indices. The highest yielding (Khangma Maap) cultivar was the most economical option due to high value/cost quotient (11.2) and marginal rate of return (Bhutan Ngultrum 16.77). Although yield levels were affected by both agronomic and socio-economic factors, Khangma Maap had higher grain and straw yield across the environments and, hence, the cultivar may be suggested for adoption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many scientists consider Si to be a ‘quasi-essential’ element for plants. Farmers in a number of countries now apply Si-containing fertilizers to the soil in order to improve crop yield. The adsorption of Si onto soil particles is an important process affecting the availability of Si to plants, yet little is known about the fate of Si after it is added to the soil. The objective of this paper was to study the adsorption of Si in three soils at different initial Si concentrations, temperatures (293 and 303 K), and reaction times. Si-adsorption behavior varied significantly between soil types. Si adsorption and adsorption rate were highest in the Yellow Drab soil and lowest in the Lou soil. In all the three soils, the slopes of the adsorption isotherms remained constant as initial Si concentrations increased from 0 to 50 mg Si/L, but declined rapidly as initial Si concentrations increased from 50 to 200 mg Si/L. This suggests that these soils contained multiple Si-adsorption sites. Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin equations all described the adsorption of Si as a function of Si concentration reasonably well, however their goodness of fit varied according to soil type. The soils also showed significant differences in buffering capacities, supply parameters, and percent saturation. The reaction kinetics for Si adsorption in the Yellow Drab and Purple Paddy soils could be divided into two stages, an initial fast reaction (0~2 h) followed by a slow reaction (2~12 h). Si adsorption in the Lou soil was slow but steady throughout the reaction period. The correlation coefficients (r 2 ) for all the equations used in this study were significant at p<0.05 significant levels. Among the kinetic equations used in this study, the parabolic diffusion, bi-constants function, Langmuir, and Elovich equations were the best for describing the relationship between reaction time and the amount of Si adsorbed onto soil particles. An analysis of activation energy (E a ) suggested that the rate-limiting step for Si adsorption in the Yellow Drab soil and the Purple Paddy soil was a diffusion-controlled process, while Si adsorption in the Lou soil seemed to be a chemically controlled process. This study shows that there are significant differences in the adsorption of Si between soil types and highlights the importance of future studies to investigate the mechanisms for Si adsorption in soil.",

Experiments have demonstrated that soil moisture causes mortality of very young larvae, whereas medium-sized larvae suffer increased mortality if the soil is very moist. We therefore hypothesise an oviposition preference of the Turnip moth for dry soil, as such behaviour may favour the survival of offspring. The present study describes experiments on A. segetum oviposition, given a choice of dry or moist soil. Furthermore we tested whether soil moisture affected oviposition on dead plant stalks that were mimicked by a steel wire object. The main result is a clear oviposition preference for dry over moist soil, meaning that increased observational efforts may be needed to predict cutworm presence in row crops on sandy soils. Another result is that objects such as plant material will receive a certain proportion of the eggs, but the proportion decreases if the soil is dry.",

During grape maturation, sugar content increased in a lesser extent than the reducing of total acidity, a balanced taste of grapes was given by the decrease in total acidity rather than sugar accumulation. Grapes of analysed cultivars showed lower concentrations of ascorbic acid and a higher content of organic nitrogenous compound. Berries with higher weight and volume (Transilvania cv.) incurred a higher mechanical deformation, while long berries (Gelu cv.) showed higher resistance to detachment from the pedicel, indicating higher resistance of grapes to packing, transport and storage. Antioxidant activity of mature grapes was high, but involvement of nonflavonoids in increasing the antioxidant capacity was statistically non-significant. Seeded table grapes of new Vitis vinifera L. cultivars showed superior physico-chemical and mechanical characteristics, indicating their high quality in the conditions of temperate continental climate, and promoting the studied cultivars as important grapevine germplasm resources.",

In this study, hyphosphere interactions between earthworms and AM fungi on soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability were investigated under field conditions with a modified chamber near the maize root. The experimental design consisted of root exclusion chambers that either allowed (30 μm pores) or precluded (0.45 μm pores) growth of AMF hyphae (AM factor), with or without earthworm addition (earthworm factor). Hyphal length density, soil and content, soil available P concentration, urease and alkaline phosphatase activities were tested at maize VT (tassel), R1 (silking), R2 (blister), R3 (milk) and R4 (dough) stage. Results showed that earthworms did not impact hyphal length density in the hyphosphere. AM and AM + E treatments caused a decrease in available phosphorus, while the E treatment increased and content during the whole experiment period. AM and AM + E treatments could significantly increase soil alkaline phosphatase activities compared to non-AMF treatments, while E and AM + E treatment could significantly increase soil urease activities compared to non-Earthworm treatments. Hyphosphere regulation of earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus on soil N and P availability might lead to greater nutrient uptake by plant.

At the first leaching event, 8% of total crop P was released from fresh, 24% from frozen and 27% from dried plant material. During decomposition, both inorganic and organic P was released following first order kinetics, with grass releasing mostly inorganic P and clover mostly organic P. After 43 days, 42%–50% of total crop P from fresh, 49%–51% from frozen and 57%–69% from dried material was released, with significant differences between treatments. Using the results in calculations on field scale showed that P released from overwintering crops under cold climate conditions can amount to several kg P ha−1. Thus, senescence of overwintering aboveground biomass can be a significant source for P leaching from soils.",

The selected isolates demonstrated strong lytic enzymatic activities and were able to produce ammonia, siderophore, Hydrogen cyanide along with capability of phosphate solubilisation. Moreover, the results showed a significant growth suppression of pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani in an in vitro assay. The plant microbe interaction study was carried out using 11 most efficient rhizobacterial strains inoculated to roots of plum plants. The inoculated PGPRs significantly augmented the leaves number per shoot, shoot diameter, shoot length and plant height. The inoculation also significantly increased the chlorophyll contents of leaves, concentration of micro and macro nutrients compared with control.

Control is typically carried out using a constant fungicide dose in the entire field although there may be large differences in crop development and biomass across the field. The objective of the study reported in this paper was to test whether the fungicide dose response curve controlling P. infestans was dependent on the crop development and biomass level. If such a biomass-dependent dose response was found it was further the purpose to evaluate the potential to optimize fungicide inputs in potato crops applying a site-specific crop density-dependent fungicide dose. The study was carried out investigating the fungicide dose response controlling P. infestans in potatoes at three biomass densities obtained growing the potato crop at three nitrogen levels. Furthermore, the field experiments included four levels of fungicide dose rate at each nitrogen rate, an untreated control, the recommended fungicide dose rate and two reduced dose rates and the experiments were replicated for three years. Nitrogen level and thus crop density had a limited although significant influence on attack of P. infestans whereas fungicide dose rate by far was the most influential variable. In contrast the interaction of nitrogen rate and fungicide dose rate that would indicate a biomass-dependent dose response was insignificant. If the variation in crop density and biomass level obtained in the study is representative for the variation found cultivating potatoes in heterogeneous fields there seem to be limited potential for fungicide optimization applying fungicides against P. infestans site-specific according to crop density or biomass.",

The present study carried out a comparison between two methods of weeding (mechanical and chemical) as well as a cereal cultivar influence on chemical composition of spelt and wheat. The research material was taken from field experiments carried out during three years. In order to assess the chemical composition, the following cereal cultivars were used: lines of winter spelt – STH 8 and STH 11 and a winter common wheat cv. Tonacja. In all cases, the overall protein content in spelt was significantly higher than in common wheat. Spelt grain is also richer in fats than common wheat. A visible tendency to higher concentration of raw fibre was observed when mechanical weeding was applied. Also, mechanical weeding as well as the variety significantly influenced β-glucan content. The study of the impact of a weeding method and a variety does not clearly show the direction of the amino acid content changes. The research indicates that there are ample opportunities to shape the level of nutrients, which decide about spelt grain application in the food industry through agronomic factors (methods of weeding and cultivar).",

    "abstract": "In poorly drained (PD) soils, fertilizer N containing NO3 is easily denitrified. To determine emissions of N2O-N from PD, imperfectly drained (ID) and moderately well drained (MD) mineral soils, soil moisture and groundwater levels were monitored, and gas samples were collected from closed gas chambers during two crop growing seasons (i.e. April to August 2011 and 2012) in the South East of Norway. The gas samples were analyzed for N2O-N flux using gas chromatograph. In 2011, the depth to groundwater table ranged between 1 and 40 cm in PD, 50 and 89 cm in ID and 74 and 96 cm in MD soils during the growing seasons. In 2012, the depths were 11–51 cm in PD, 55–81 cm in ID and 46–78 cm in MD soil. Daily mean water filled pore space (WFPS) ranged between 51% and 70% in PD, 44% and 62% in ID and 38% and 72% in MD soils in 2011 and in 2012, the WFPS felled within this range. During the growing season, N2O flux rate (µg N m−2 h−1) varied from 20 to 635 (6–878) in PD, 22 to 112 (11–1607) in ID and 4 to 33 (8–92) in MD soils in 2011–2012 (mean of five chambers). Peak N2O-N fluxes in PD and ID soils were detected one week after fertilizer applications and immediately after rain events. Cumulative N2O-N emissions (kg N ha−1) from PD (6–10), from ID (4–12) and from MD soils (0.2–0.9) were emitted during (2011–2012) growing season. In general, PD soils emitted more N2O-N compared to MD soils mainly due to higher soil moisture and relatively shallow ground water table.",

    "abstract": "Plant growth regulator, kinetin, is known to modulate the key physiological processes under abiotic stresses in different crops. However, kinetin-mediated response at different growth stages of crop plants is lagging behind. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to appraise the potential role of exogenously applied kinetin in alleviating the effects of water scarcity on wheat. Three levels of kinetin (0, 75, and 150 mg/L) were used either as seed treatment or foliar spray at the vegetative or the post-anthesis stage. Water deficit markedly reduced shoot fresh mass, plant chlorophyll level, flag leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate. Degradation of chlorophyll a was greater in plants subjected to post-anthesis water-deficit conditions. However, plants growing under continuous water-deficit conditions had significantly lower concentration of chlorophyll b than those treated with water scarcity at the post-anthesis stage or receiving normal irrigation. Inhibited photosynthesis of wheat in response to post-anthesis water-deficit conditions was largely due to non-stomatal factors. In contrast, stomatal factors were the main constraints for photosynthesis in plants growing under continuous scarcity of water. Plants subjected to continuous water starvation had markedly lower grain yield than those subjected to water-deficit conditions at post-anthesis stage. Application of kinetin before seed sowing or at the post-anthesis stage significantly reduced the negative effects of drought on flag leaf chlorophyll and stomatal conductance. Lower level of kinetin (75 mg/L) was found to be more effective in mitigating the inhibitory effects of water shortage on photosynthesis and growth, and improved grain yield under water scarcity.",

    "abstract": "Delaying tillage and incorporation of arable crop residues in autumn may limit accumulation of soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) and reduce nitrogen (N) leaching. However, on clay soils, high water content during late tillage can impair soil structure and fertility. This study investigated the effects of tillage timing on SMN (0–90 cm depth), soil physical properties in the topsoil and yield in two Swedish clay soils differing in clay content. SMN generally increased during autumn and also with earlier tillage. On a heavy clay soil (Ultuna; ∼60% clay), SMN increased throughout winter until spring and the amount of N leached was probably small. In contrast, on a clay loam soil in southernmost Sweden (Rydsgård; ∼35% clay), SMN decreased during winter by up to 26 kg ha−1. In general, measured soil water content (w) was lower than 0.9 × plastic limit (PL) at the time of early tillage (mouldboard ploughing or stubble cultivation), while it exceeded 0.9 PL at the time of normal and late tillage. The proportion of small aggregates produced by tillage was negatively correlated to relative soil water content at the time of tillage (w/PL). Conventional methods to determine soil physical qualities (bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, aggregate tensile strength) did not show any clear differences between treatments. However, plant emergence and yield were significantly reduced after late compared with early tillage at Ultuna, a trend that has persisted from 2000 until the present. These results suggest that the suitability of delayed autumn tillage as a means to reduce SMN accumulation and N leaching varies between Swedish clay soils. A reduction in N leaching can be achieved on lighter clay soils in warmer and moister areas, whereas the effects may be small on heavier clay soils in central Sweden, where repeated late tillage carries a risk of yield reduction.",

    "abstract": "Acid soil has led to a significant decrease in vegetable yield in high-yield greenhouse vegetable production system. Chicken manure and fulvic acid (FA) application experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects on chemical properties of soil in vegetable greenhouse so as to confirm whether FA could replace chicken manure in acid soil amelioration under the same addition levels of nutrient, when compared to the effect of chemical fertilizers application alone on acid soil improvement. The results showed that the pH of soil added with chicken manure and FA, respectively, increased from the original value of 5.4 to 5.99 and 6.32 at the end of the experiment, while soil pH applied only with chemical fertilizers decreased to 5.43. Correlation analysis indicated that cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil was positively correlated with soil pH buffering capacity. The peak values of soil CEC and pH buffering capacity occurred in April each year and subsequently tended to decrease in August and December throughout the experiment. Data demonstrated that chicken manure and FA in combination with soil contributed to soil base saturation that increased from 26.5%, 33.8% to 36.7%, 45.9% in chicken manure and FA treated soil during December 2011 to December 2012, respectively; however, chemical fertilizers displayed an adverse effect on soil base saturation that decreased from 17.1% to 5.6% on the same time period. Exchangeable aluminum (Al) concentration showed a weak but significant increase by 5.2% on August 2012 in comparison to April 2012, as chemical fertilizers were added into soil alone. Unlike to chemical fertilizer, chicken manure and FA significantly decreased soil exchangeable Al concentration from the original value of 5.37 cmol kg−1 to 4.56 and 4.22 cmol kg−1 at the end of experiment respectively. Compared to total yield treated solely with chemical fertilizers, chemical fertilizers combination with chicken manure or FA resulted in an increase in total yield in 2011 and 2012. Although chicken manure and FA possessed the same trend of improving acidic soil in vegetable greenhouse, a greater contribution was attributed to FA due to its lower mineralization rate of organic matter. Therefore, it was suggested that FA could completely displace chicken manure in improvement in acidic soil in vegetable greenhouse.",

In Sweden, the main weed targeted by glyphosate is Elymus repens (L.) Gould. We sampled 69 clones of E. repens to assess the magnitude and geographical distribution of variation in susceptibility to glyphosate. Clones originated from four habitat types: intensively and extensively used arable lands, field vicinities and other habitats, including natural vegetation. Susceptibility varied greatly among clones with GR50 (50% of untreated growth reduction) spanning over at least one order of magnitude, 17–278 active ingredient ha−1 in a pot experiment setting. There was a strong covariance between geographic and genetic distance, but there was no evidence of geographic or genetic differentiation in GR50. Nor did GR50 vary consistently between habitat types. We conclude that no indication of past selection was found towards the resistance to glyphosate in E. repens clones in Sweden. The great variability in susceptibility suggests that there might be a potential for such selection.",

Isolates were stored in sterile distilled water with leaf blades in screw capped 15 ml McCarthy bottles at 18°C. The pathogen was identified as Pythium irregulare based on morphological structures and species description. The isolates were inoculated on healthy potted chickpea plants and these showed root rot symptoms similar to field observation. The pathogen was re-isolated from the inoculated plants and cultured; they showed similar characteristics to the ones observed during the first isolation.

Fruit from three growing seasons were stored at 1% or 2% O2 (both at 2% CO2) at either 1°C or 3°C in small research units; controls were kept in the same ventilated rooms at the two temperatures (ambient air). The fruit were removed from storage after four or six months and assessed for fruit decay immediately afterwards and after two weeks at 20°C. Fruit quality parameters were recorded at the end of storage. On a three-year average, fruit stored in CA was less ripe at the end of storage. After both four and six months storage, CA reduced total decay (physiological disorders and fungal decay) by on average 70% and 45%, respectively, compared to storage in ambient air. Senescent breakdown was lower after CA storage for four months, but not after six months and not after simulated shelf life. Soft scald was lower when stored in CA both after cold storage at 1°C and simulated shelf life. After storage at 3°C there was lower incidence of soft scald when stored in CA after four months, but not after six months. For fungal fruit decay in general, there was no effect of low oxygen, however, 2% O2 gave slightly less bitter rot (Colletotrichum acutatum) than 1% O2 and significantly less than ambient air after simulated shelf life. Averaged over all oxygen levels, 1°C gave significantly less bitter rot than 3°C. It may be concluded that use of CA for storage of 'Aroma' is a good way of reducing development of physiological disorders. However, development of bitter rot seemed to be more influenced by temperature and storage time than by low O2.",

Therefore, an outdoor experiment was performed in Sweden in 2008, to evaluate the effect of root fragmentation on generative reproduction of S. arvensis. Two artificial populations of S. arvensis with the same total root length per area but with different initial root lengths and different numbers of root fragments were planted. Cumulative numbers of flower receptacles which had shed mature seeds over the season were assessed. Changes in the number of seeds per flower receptacle and average seed weight were monitored over time during the late season. Plants from long root fragments produced more flower receptacles than plants from short ones. Per area, however, the number of mature flower receptacles did not differ. The number of seeds per flower receptacle and individual seed weight were not affected by initial root length for the first cohort of shoots which sprouted from the initially planted roots. A second cohort, from roots produced during the season, resulted, irrespective of its initial root length, in fewer flower receptacles per plant and per area, with less seeds per receptacle, but with the same average seed weight as the first cohort. The number of seeds per flower receptacle was higher in mid-September than earlier or later. Average seed weight slightly decreased over time. The weight of seeds produced in early September was inversely related to the number of seeds per receptacle, but this trade-off disappeared over time. Root fragmentation alone in pure populations of S. arvensis does not impede generative reproduction, but is likely to decrease input of seeds to the seed bank, when combined with crop competition.",

Therefore, the optimizing of fertilizer rate for BRIS soils and selection of suitable soil amendments are crucial to get a higher yield. In this study, the effects of different combinations of urea, chicken manure and biochar on soil properties, growth performance and physiological characteristics of kenaf cultivated on the BRIS soil were investigated. Eight treatments were conducted namely: control (T1), biochar (T2), chicken manure (T3), urea (T4), chicken manure + urea (T5), biochar + chicken manure (T6), urea + biochar (T7) and biochar + chicken manure + urea (T8). The biomass and physiological characteristics of kenaf were recorded every month, while the soil was analyzed following a standard laboratory procedure. The application of organic and inorganic fertilizer (urea) significantly increased the nutrient content of the soil compared to the T1, whereas T3 showed the highest pH, cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable bases (Na, Mg, Ca). However, the mixing of biochar with organic and inorganic fertilizers showed the highest plant height, diameter of stem and number of leaves as well as dry biomass compared to other treatments. Furthermore, the application of nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductivity. The results suggest that the mixing of biochar with organic and inorganic fertilizers represents an effective approach for the cultivation of kenaf in tropical climate.",

The desiccation of black oat with glyphosate caused a reduction in root dry mass by approximately 60% in both experiments. The glyphosate and glufosinate-ammonium reduced the amount of N present in the aboveground portion; however, the paraquat herbicide did not modify it. None of the herbicides applied affected N losses in the black oat plant–soil system. However, 5–15% of the N applied as fertilizer was lost up to harvest. The results suggest that black oat can be used as a cover crop in direct sowing in order to avoid nitrogen losses in the soil–plant system.",

    "abstract": "Biomonitoring of the local population and environmental monitoring in eastern Croatia have revealed abnormalities in metal and metalloid distribution that could be related to war activities during the 1990s. The goal of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the concentrations of metals and metalloids by comparing locations of high and low-intensity combat activity; we also evaluated a possible connection between metal contamination in soil and in humans. We sampled 14 locations and measured the concentrations of 20 war related metals and metalloids (Al, As, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mg, Ni, Pb, Sb, Si, Sr, U, V and Zn). The results of principal components analysis showed two main clusters: locations Dopsin and Dalj (both characterized by high-intensity combat activity), where the concentrations of most elements (except Hg) were increased. Although the concentrations of metals and metalloids in cabbage samples collected in eastern Croatia did not exceed the maximum allowed values, the results of our study confirmed existance of environmental ‘hotspot’ with higher concentrations of war metals and metalloids. Our findings indicate that there is a possible common source and mechanism of transferring metals from the environment to the population.",

    "abstract": "Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) are sedentary endo-parasite that causes severe yield loss in carrot. Chemical nematicides currently used to manage Meloidogyne incognita are being phased out because of rising health and environmental issues. This study aimed to evaluate nematicidal effect of various concentrations, viz., 250, 500, 750, 1000ppm of leaf extract of Ipomoea carnea against M. incognita infecting carrot under in vitro and in pots assays. In our result, all tested concentrations displayed J2s mortality and egg hatching inhibition along with improving growth of carrot and reduced J2s population and root-knot index. Molecular docking performed predicts binding interactions of two major compounds, viz., neophytadiene and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol as shown by GC-MS analysis with targeted protein, odorant response gene-1 of M. incognita, to confirm nematicidal action of I. carnea leaf extract. The obtained results also suggested that neophytadiene interacted more and strongly bound with odorant response gene-3 than 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. The biochemical ligand-target protein interaction described in the present work will be helpful in the logical selection of biomolecules and essential proteins. Therefore, plant extract may be used the best alternative to chemical nematicides to control root-knot nematodes and caused longitudinal growth of the plant as well as reduce environmental risks.",

The data cover chemical plant protection in field vegetable farms in southwestern Finland in 2009–2019. The timing of treatments, made with different pesticides in the weeks following sowing, corresponded with the known phenology of different pests of carrot, swede and fresh pea. The same was true for the carrot fly, the pea moth and the second generation of the cabbage root fly when phenological flight time models using historical data were used to predict the timing of treatments. We conclude that farmers acted in accordance with the principles of IPM when practising chemical control. For those species that lacked phenological predictive models in the study years, the degree days for the observed timing of treatments can be used as a starting point if such models are developed in the future. Our results can be used as a long-term baseline in future surveys on the changes in pesticide use and their risks regarding the studied crops.",

In addition, top growth of the plants was observed. Plants were grown under controlled conditions in a phytotron, fertilized with various levels of nitrogen and tested for freezing resistance after a hardening treatment at 6°C and 0.5°C. Soluble carbohydrates in the stolons of white clover were analysed using an-throne reaction and gas chromatography. Vegetative growth of timothy was almost equally enhanced by all three types of nitrogen fertilization, and the maximum growth was obtained at 8-16mM nitrogen. In white clover, the highest fresh and dry weight of the top was obtained with nitrate, followed by combined ammonium plus nitrate fertilization. White clover was sensitive to ammonium, and concentrations above 4 mM strongly inhibited growth. Frost resistance in timothy was reduced by nitrogen levels above 8 mM, more by ammonium than nitrate. Frost resistance in white clover was not affected significantly by nitrate but the highest level of ammonium nitrate (64 mM) partly prevented cold hardening. The sucrose content of white clover stolons increased in all treatments during hardening, and there was statistically significant positive correlation between sucrose content and the level of frost hardiness. Neither the glucose nor the pinitol content of stolons was affected by hardening.",

(timothy) of the same age were grown in five sequential four-week periods during one growth season (May 5-September 23) at low (380 μmol mol−1) and high (650 μmol mol−1) CO2 concentration. The experiment was performed in 10 9 m2field plots surrounded by plastic foil walls (“field chambers”) in the relatively cool climate (10-13°C mean temperature) of the west coast of Norway (59°N latitude). Raising the CO2 concentration generally decreased the height of the grass (8-23%), especially at the beginning and end of the growth season The number of shoots was significantly increased (13-42%) by CO2enrichment in all growth periods except the last. Elevated CO2 did not influence the above-ground biomass (dry weight) in the first (May) and last (September) period, but increased it by 14-51% in the intervening periods (June-August). Positive effects of CO2 enrichment on plant biomass were correlated with positive effects on the number of shoots. Elevated CO2 concentrations resulted in 25-64% denser plant biomass (dry weight per unit air volume) in the different growth periods. In general, a positive “chamber effect” on plant height and dry weight was found in spite of the small air temperature differences between the insides and the outsides of the chambers. A greenhouse experiment showed that wind speeds above 3 m s−1 strongly decreased height and dry weight of timothy seedlings. The reduced wind speeds inside the chambers could therefore explain the “chamber effects” found. Key Words: climatemorphogenesis",

Different temperature two‐dimensional electrophoresis revealed that in the group III strains some intracellular proteins were modified at the highest temperature.

The samples were analysed with traditional chemical methods as well as near‐infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma analysis. Multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis and partial least squares regression) was used to evaluate the results. It was found that the main difference of practical importance was a significantly higher percentage of clover in organically grown leys. The NIR analysis detected differences in botanical composition and with harvest times. Differences other than botanical composition between organic and conventional samples could only be detected in samples within the same botanical fraction and harvest time. It was concluded that it is important for an organic farmer to monitor the botanical composition and integrate this information in the forage evaluation.

    "abstract": "Trials were performed with early and semi-early potatoes to test the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilizer level (0-160 kg N ha-1) and timing (all at planting versus half then and half either soon after emergence or 3 weeks later). All seven trials with earlies were irrigated as required, whilst different irrigation regimes (moderate versus intensive) were compared in two trials with semi-earlies. No benefit was derived from splitting the N application. Haulm growth and N uptake increased in all cases almost linearly up to the highest N level, but tuber yield did not respond in the same way. The optimum N level was 80 kg N ha-1 for a yield of 15 Mg ha-1, rising to 120 kg N ha-1 for a yield of 40 Mg ha-1. Tuber quality was lowered by the use of excess N fertilizer, particularly in the case of earlies. The quantity of mineralised N present in the soil after harvest rose sharply with above optimum fertilizer use, and the amount of N present in crop residues also increased. The likely leaching after early potatoes was estimated to be up to 80 kg N ha-1. The proportion of fertilizer N which was not accounted for in either tuber yield, crop residues or mineral N in soil was 26% in earlies and 38% in semi-earlies.",

The aim of this study was to find out if any of these materials can be safely used on agricultural soils to induce net N immobilization of N, and thereby decrease nitrate (NO 3 ) leaching. Chemical characterization showed that secondary sludge derived from biological waste water treatment was a nutrient-rich material low in fiber content, whereas primary and de-inked fiber sludge were high in fiber content and low in nutrient content. Cellulose-C and hemi-cellulose-C amounted to 46% and 36% of the organic C present, respectively, and C/N ratios were around 130 in primary and de-inked fiber sludge. Incubation studies at 8°C over 2 months showed that the decomposability of primary and de-inked fiber sludge in soil was not significantly different. Both showed lower decomposability than secondary sludge. Concentrations of inorganic N in soil declined to very low levels after application of primary and deinked fiber sludge and their capacity for net N immobilization was 4.8-7.2 kg N t - 1 C added at 5°C. However, contents of Cu, Cd and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in de-inked fiber sludge limit its use on arable land. Only primary fiber sludge was found to be suitable as a introgen catch fiber material for use on agricultural soils.",

    "abstract": "Cultivated blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) was recently introduced in Norway, and most plantings were established in the 1990's. Many of these plantings died back or had severe damage on leaves and stems. Plant pathogens incombination with frost injury were suspected to be the cause of the damage. In 1998-99, field and greenhouse plantings of blackberry were surveyed for the occurrence of plant pathogenic and saprophytic fungi. A total of 33 different fungi were identified in 18 cultivars from 23 plantings (19 field and 4 greenhouse). Of these, 12 were pathogenic fungi, while 21 were non-pathogenic, secondary invaders. The most important pathogens on the canes were (common name in parenthesis) Septocyta ruborum (Purple blotch), Gnomonia rubi (Gnomonia canker) and Sydowiella depressula (Sydowiella canker). Pathogenic fungi of less importance on the canes were Elsinoe veneta (Anthracnose) and Coniothyrium fuckelii (Cane blight). Peronospora sparsa (Downy mildew) was the most important fungus attacking leaves. On fruits Botrytis cinerea (Grey mould) was the most prevalent pathogen. Cladosporium spp. (Cladosporium rot) and Penicillium spp. (Blue mould) were frequently observed on fruits, but did not seem to be of significant importance. Other minor fruit rots were due to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Bitter rot) and Mucor sp. (Mucor rot). Phragmidium violaceum (Blackberry rust) was found on canes and leaves, but was of minor importance. G. rubi and S. depressula caused damage mostly in the thornless cultivars, and P. sparsa was found almost exclusively in the thornless cultivar 'Loch Ness'. Both thorny and thornless cultivars were damaged by S. ruborum. In greenhouses the major fungal problem was B. cinerea.",

The cherries were held at a temperature of 0°C, or 2°C for up to three weeks. The fruit quality was evaluated on juice optical density (OD), titratable acidity (TA), pH, soluble solids content (SSC), ethanol, firmness and flavour. In general, CA had little effect on SSC in the three seasons and did not show any effects in reducing pitting. Controlled atmosphere has shown some beneficial effects on flavour, reducing decay, reducing toughening, and maintaining TA in sweet cherries. Generally, flavour score was higher for fruit kept in CA than for fruit stored in air, and the higher the CO2 the better the taste. 'Van' and 'Sam' showed excellent taste scores after three weeks both from CA and air storage. There was very little ethanol accumulation in the fruits under CA, and it was well below the detrimental level. It is recommended that O2 levels for sweet cherry storage can be further reduced below 10% and/or CO2 can be increased above 15%.",

Under the climatic conditions prevailing in Sweden, growing a catch crop after winter cereals is of particular interest because the latter are usually followed by a spring sown crop, leaving the ground bare during autumn and winter. Field trials were carried out during three growing seasons in an integrated farming system and for one year in an organic farming system. Competition from the dense wheat crop in the integrated farming system had a negative effect on the undersown species, and at harvest of the wheat they showed quite poor growth in all three years, with nitrogen contents under 5 kg ha−1. No significant yield increase was measured without added nitrogen when the averages for all three years were calculated. On average, the grain yields were improved by 750 kg ha−1 (14% moisture content) for the treatments with undersown clover for all three years when 90 kg N ha−1 were added. The experiment within the organic system showed a different pattern with a better development of the undersown clover species, with nitrogen contents approximately 25 kg ha−1 and an improvement in oat grain yield, from around 2 000 kg ha−1 for the control to almost 3 500 kg ha−1 with clover undersown the previous year.",

In order to select nitrogen-efficient cultivars, field experiments were conducted with 199 rice (Oryza sativa L., japonica) cultivars/lines at three nitrogen levels (0, 126 and 180 kg N/ha) in order to screen the differences of genotypes in nitrogen efficiency. Results showed that genotype is the dominating factor in determining grain yield rather than environmental factors. In general, grain yield relies on: 1) nitrogen uptake and biomass; 2) grain nitrogen use efficiency and physiological nitrogen use efficiency; and 3) harvest index and nitrogen harvest index. The N-efficient cultivars are LA19, XS48, MJ199, YJ38, HD and GD4, and N-inefficient cultivars are DN413, HJ19, FNXHM, NY1819 and ELIO. Our results demonstrated that nitrogen use efficiency is a genetic character of these cultivars, and those selected N-efficient cultivars may be applied in agricultural systems with low nitrogen input and still produce high yield. These cultivars are therefore ideal plants for studying the genetic and molecular mechanisms of nitrogen use efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Changes in cropping systems during the past century have led to selective pressure on weed flora. Species and ecotypes with characteristics enabling them to survive in high-input farmland have increased in numbers, at the cost of plants lacking these characters. Since the 1950s, the perennial weed species Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. and Sonchus arvensis L. have mainly been controlled by the herbicide group synthetic auxins like MCPA. During recent decades, C. arvense seems to have become less susceptible to MCPA in both Europe and North America but the reasons are unclear. To study the importance of selective pressure on weed ecotypes, both short- and long-term studies were carried out in Uppsala, Sweden. The first consisted of two growth-characteristic greenhouse experiments. The hypothesis was that ecotypes of C. arvense and S. arvensis from high-input farmland were different and displayed a more competitive growth pattern than did ecotypes from low-input farmland. The second study was a field experiment with four ecotypes of C. arvense from low-input farmland to study if selective pressure was in force, over a period of six years. The four ecotypes had different growth characteristics and herbicide sensitivity and they were exposed to crop competition and MCPA treatments during the experimental period. The hypothesis was that ecotypes with a more competitive growth pattern and MCPA tolerance would survive to a greater extent than would other ecotypes. For C. arvense, the results from the growth-characteristic experiment showed that the growth pattern of ecotypes from high-input farmland differed, showing a more directly elongated growth pattern with fewer spines on the leaves compared with ecotypes from low-input farmland, which usually were of rosette-type. Results from the field experiment with C. arvense showed that after six years MCPA-sensitive and/or rosette-type ecotypes had almost disappeared while ecotypes with a more directly elongated growth pattern and less sensitive to MCPA survived to a much greater extent. The conclusion was therefore that when exposed to selective pressure like crop competition and herbicide treatments, ecotypes of C. arvense with a more directly elongated growth pattern and less sensitive to herbicide treatment survived to a greater extent compared with ecotypes missing these traits. Ecotypes from high-input farmland had generally fewer leaf spines than did ecotypes from low-input farmland. This may suggest a trade-off between spine formation and rapid competitive growth. In the growth-characteristic experiment with S. arvensis, no differences between ecotypes from high- and low-input farmland regarding growth characteristics or leaf spines could be detected. This might partly be due to a lower exposure of S. arvensis to selective pressure compared with C. arvense, since S. arvensis generally is less sensitive to MCPA.",

The highest dry matter (DM) yield of kg ha−1 and crude protein content (%) was obtained from the treatments that included fertilizer. There was no difference in DM production between any of the combination treatments that involved fertilizer and the fertilizer alone treatment. Only lime and aeration applications also increased yield compared to control, but not as much as did any treatment including fertilizer. Crude protein content of the pasture ranged from 13.3 to 18.1% across locations. Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer are recommended to improve DM yields and herbage quality for pastures under hazelnut orchards.",

Potato is a modest source of dietary nutrients. The purpose of this study was to assess the mineral (Fe & Zn) composition of potato germplasm in Ethiopia and grower's willingness to try new potato types. The Fe and Zn contents were assessed in peeled tubers of popular farmer varieties, and newly introduced Andean diploid group Phureja accessions and improved tetraploid clones grown in multi-location trials. Grower's preferences for the new potato types was assessed using a participatory approach. Significant variations in mineral and tuber yield traits exist among the germplasm assessed and broad-sense heritability appears to be high for most traits measured, suggesting that progress through breeding can be made among these materials. However, the slightly negative correlation of tuber yield with Fe and Zn content and user appreciation traits found in this study suggests that progress in improving crops for yield and enhanced Fe and Zn concentrations with end-user acceptable quality will be challenging. The results from this study provide baseline information on Fe and Zn composition of many popular farmer varieties in Ethiopia and end-user preference criteria for evaluating new potato varieties that would help to orient the biofortification breeding to the conditions and preference of farmers.",

Shifts in the rural economy, the loss of good-quality agricultural soil to urbanisation, and sub-optimal land management leading to erosion are at issue. Here, we apply quantitative and qualitative methods to assess erosion risk, whilst considering legislative and policy measures and the responsibility of individual farmer. The studied area was the cadastral district of Rtyně-Podkrkonoší. This choice was based on the fact that farmland there is classified as being subject to 'no risk' under current reference measures with regard to soil erosion, and yet 18 erosion events in this area were reported over a period of three years. Our results provide evidence that current measures are insufficient. Although applicable standards were followed, the farmland in question has undergone repeated erosion, whilst soil conservation practice has been ineffective. Compared to the farmland owner, who invests in long-term management, we highlight the problem when a land manager prefers short-term returns. Our assessment of soil erosion was focused on repeated erosion reports that were filed in the monitoring system in relation to farmland parcels managed by a company specialising in maize production. The tolerable erosion rate of 4/t/ha/y was exceeded on all land parcels.",

Thus, this study aimed to compare the effects of foliar sprays using Zn chelate against those with new Zn sources such as sorbitol-stabilised Zn nitrate and Zn oxide nanoparticles on rice seed enrichment and production. Treatments were arranged in a completely randomised design, comprising of three Zn sources and four Zn concentrations with four replicates. Rice plants were sprayed three times: at the beginning of tillering, maximum tillering, and booting stage. Experimental unity consisted of 7-dm³ pots filled with 5-dm³ medium textured sand. Each pot had 10 plants, of which 6 randomly harvested at the flowering stage and the remaining at the maturity stage. Plant dry matter, content and accumulation of Zn in the shoot, seed Zn content, and seed production at the grain-filling stage were also estimated. Seed production and Zn accumulation showed a quadratic behaviour with the use of novel sources. Overall the new Zn sources were more effective than the traditional EDTA chelated Zn in terms of rice seed production and quality, especially the sorbitol-stabilised Zn nitrate.",

Changes in soil because of prolonged fertilisation can only be estimated by long-term field trials. Experiments in long-term field trial site Kuusiku (since 1965) include crop rotation of potato, late harvest barley, early harvest barley undersown with forage grasses (red clover + timothy), 1-year forage grasses, 2-year forage grasses, and winter rye. Various combinations of mineral and organic fertilisers were used to investigate the yield, soil humus, phosphorus, and potassium content (available and total) of the top- and subsoil. Fertilisation improved the yield of different crops by 1.3–2.6 times; meteorological conditions caused the yield to vary up to 6.4 times. The concentration of humus decreased 0.2% when not using inorganic and organic fertilisers; use of fertilisers increased the concentration of humus by 0.2–0.6%. The humus-rich subsoil (3.5% humus) contained less available phosphorus than humus-poor subsoil (humus 3.0%), which had 29 and 63 mg PDL kg−1, respectively. Grasses in crop rotation enriched the soil with organic matter and reduced the excess of nutrients remaining from previous fertilisation, thereby decreasing nutrient leakage and eutrophication of bodies of water.",

Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) is an essential cereal in Tunisia, a country threatened by salinity stress. In this study, 26 accessions of Tunisian durum wheat were subjected to salinity stress induced by 500 mM NaCl, and their salinity tolerance was evaluated by examining phenotypic parameters and calculating the salinity tolerance trait index and salinity tolerance index. Furthermore, two Tunisian durum wheat cultivars, namely ‘Om Rabia’ (salinity-tolerant) and ‘Mahmoudi’ (salinity-susceptible), were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected from the RNA-Seq data of these two cultivars. The impacts of all SNP variants on genes were predicted, and 157 candidate SNP primer pairs were designed preferentially using high-impact transcripts. Following confirmation using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of data from ‘Om Rabia’ and ‘Mahmoudi’, 17 SNP markers were developed and applied to assess the remaining 26 Tunisian durum wheat lines. Three developed SNP markers (KUCMB_TRIDC7AG078450.6_12, KUCMB_TRIDC2BG061830.1_05, and KUCMB_TRIDC2BG061830.1_08) showed PCR bands only in salinity-tolerant lines but not in moderately tolerant or susceptible lines.

Compared with light and frequent irrigation, deep and infrequent irrigation improved root development in the 10- to 20-cm soil layer in the second year after sowing. A decrease in turf visual quality on SS receiving light and frequent irrigation in the second year was associated with low infiltration rate. Neither thickness nor content of organic matter in the mat layer were significantly affected by the treatments.

This filamentous fungus is found on the roots of many crops and can persist in the soil up to 15 years as microsclerotia. High prevalence of corky root rot can be partly explained by the endurance and the broad host range of P. lycopersici, but how this fungus can gain access to host roots is still poorly understood, as its competitive saprophytic ability is very low. We have combined microscopy and reporter gene techniques to investigate the tomato–P. lycopersici interaction in vitro, and discovered the pathogen secretes molecules that change the direction of root growth and induce cell necrosis specifically in the apical part of the root of tomato (apex, elongation zone and beginning of the root hair zone). Moreover, we found that the fungus preferentially infects immature root cells that are sensitive to these secreted fungal molecules, whereas infection is blocked in mature and insensitive parts of the root. Our study sheds light on novel and important features of the biology of this pathogen, which could contribute to its fitness in the rhizosphere.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although winter survival of winter wheat most often is recorded qualitatively by rating dead or living plants, the surviving plants may differ extensively in vigour and degree of carbohydrate reserves left at the end of winter. This factor is yet not accounted for in existing models of winter wheat yield and crop performance. A quantitative measure of plant vigour at spring arrival, as influenced by the prevailing winter weather and the plants’ concentration of water soluble carbohydrates, would hence make a useful supplement to such models. Two cultivars of winter wheat were grown in boxes over 2 years at three sites in Norway with contrasting winter climates. Plants were sampled monthly for measurements of growth potential and analyses of reserve carbohydrates. Fructan constituted the main part of water soluble carbohydrates (WSC). The concentration of fructan fell throughout winter, but increased rapidly after snow thaw in spring when a positive carbon balance was restored. Daily global radiation at plant level and soil temperature (2 cm) were the only two climatic factors found to have significant effects on periodic changes in fructan concentration in a stepwise regression analysis. Still, number of days with snow cover had a causal effect through its impact on soil temperature and radiation at plant level. In neither of the 2 years was there any significant correlation between plant carbohydrate concentration and growth potential at the different sites. The results implied that plant vigour at the end of winter was strongly related to plant condition in late autumn and duration of snow cover in winter. Plants that had been covered with snow for a long time period showed significantly lower growth at the samplings in March and April than plants from the location with a shorter duration of snow cover.",

Replacement-series experiments were conducted to evaluate the mode and strength of competitiveness of four legume cover crop species, Calopogonium caeruleum, Centrosema pubescens, Mucuna bracteata and Pueraria javanica, and one soft grass species, Axonopus compressus, against Asystasia gangetica and Pennisetum polystachion. Relative yield, relative yield total and relative crowding coefficient were calculated with reference to shoot biomass. Asystasia gangetica was a consistently weaker competitor than Pennisetum polystachion. The legume cover crop species had higher relative yield when grown in mixtures, whereas the yield of Asystasia gangetica was lower in mixtures with legumes than in monoculture. The higher competitiveness of legumes was due to greater canopy height and leaf area index. Centrosema pubescens was a slightly weaker competitor than the other legumes. Although leaf area per plant of Centrosema pubescens did not differ from that of other three legumes, canopy height and blocking photosynthetically active radiation to the soil surface were lower. When grown with a cover crop for 12 weeks, dry weight per plant, leaf area and shoot number of Pennisetum polystachion increased as its proportion decreased in mixtures. Relative yield data indicated that Pennisetum polystachion is a strong competitor. Axonopus compressus was less susceptible to Pennisetum polystachion interference than the legumes. All cover crop species studied proved highly competitive against Asystasia gangetica, but none could compete against Pennisetum polystachion. The study confirms the feasibility of using a cover crop for management of Asystasia gangetica.",

Results of the first experiment revealed significant variation among the 20 tested genotypes in the investigated quality parameters that were consistent with the discovered variation in the maturity of the genotypes determined in terms of their Mean Stage by Count (MSC). In the second experiment, few but consistent significant differences were detected between near-isogenic diploids and tetraploids.

Results showed that germination percentage of purslane seeds was not inhibited by concentration of water extract of tested plants. However, seed vigour index and seedling growth strongly influenced by aqueous extracts of tested plants. Maximum inhibitions on seedling growth were recorded when using the higher concentration of the aqueous extract (20 gL−1). It was apparent that sugar beet had a greater inhibitory effect than eucalyptus. Shoot length of purslane seedlings significantly decreased at 10 and 20 gL−1 aqueous extract concentration of sugar beet by 65.5 and 92.1%, respectively, compared to the control, while eucalyptus decreased seedling shoot length of target weed at 10 and 20 gL−1 extract concentration by 29.8 and 52.9%. Root length was more affected than shoot so that low aqueous extract concentration (10 gL−1) of sugar beet and eucalyptus decreased root length of target weed by 79.8% and 46%, respectively. Foliar sprays with both 10 and 20 gL−1 of tested plants extracts significantly decreased leaf area, leaves, stem and root dry weight of purslane weed. Maximum leaf area (1010 cm2) was obtained from the untreated plants (0% extract), while the lowest value (166.6 cm2) occurred with 20 gL−1 water extract of sugar beet. High aqueous extract concentration (20 gL−1) of sugar beet decreased leaves, stem and root dry weight of purslane plants by 96, 86.7 and 91.9%, respectively, compared to controls.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a key role in crop productivity and soil quality. Conservation agriculture has a positive effect on SOC accumulation in the surface soil horizons, but little information is available regarding the effect of the removal of crop residues by burning. This study aimed to assess the impact of different types of crop residue management practices on the total C distribution and natural abundance of 13C (‰, δ13C). Two volcanic soils, located in the Mediterranean temperate zone of Southern Chile, were studied: an Ultisol (Collipulli Series, CPL) and an Andisol (Santa Bárbara Series, SBA). Both soils had been cultivated under direct-drilling and a typical annual crop rotation system for a long period of time. Two different types of crop residue management practices were imposed in both soils: (i) crop residue burning (CPL-B; SBA-B) and (ii) crop residue retention over the soil (CPL-R; SBA-R), corresponding to treatments B and R, respectively. Soil profile distribution of the C content and natural abundance of 13C were analysed for bulk soils (down to 100 cm depth) and three particle-size fractions of the soils (down to 20 cm of soil depth): (a) ≤ 53 µm, (b) 53-212 µm and (c) ≥ 212 µm. It was found that the effect of crop residue management can be observed in the variations of C content and δ13C in the soil profile in both volcanic soils. Crop residue burning (B treatment) increased the C content in bulk soil and the particle-size fractions. On the other hand, soil organic matter of crop residue retention (R treatment) showed higher natural abundance of 13C (δ13C) compared with residue burning (B treatment) in the two volcanic soils. R treatment enriched the particle-size fractions (except ≥ 212 µm fraction of CPL soil) with 13C. Factors that could account for these findings are also discussed here.",

Unfertilized soil served as controls. Eight Fusarium species were isolated and identified based on their morphological characteristics and nucleic acid analysis. Four dominant species including F. proliferatum, F. solani, F. equiseti, and F. semitectum accounted for 95% of isolates. No differences in total Fusarium population levels and diversity indices with organic and CF were found. Both fertilizer applications increased population levels of F. equiseti in soil, due to its better competition for nutrients. High nutrients also impacted F. solani population. These two species should be monitored when applying OF and CF. The decrease of F. proliferatum population across the growing seasons was attributed to decomposition of maize debris from preceding crop in soil.",

The experiment was carried out with four treatments, viz. plants pre-inoculated with G. fasciculatum, plants pre-inoculated with G. fasciculatum followed by infection with F. oxysporum, plants infected with F. oxysporum, and plants without any of the two microorganisms. Mycorrhization (%) was reduced in pathogen-challenged plants. In G. fasciculatum- and F. oxysporum- treated plants, an increase in phenolic content was observed on the 20th day while the maximum increase in phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity was observed on the 15th day after challenge inoculation with F. oxysporum compared with that of other treatments. In G. fasciculatum- and F. oxysporum-treated plants, an increase in peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activity was observed on the 15th day after pathogen challenge compared with that of other treatments. The observation revealed that the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus fasciculatum systemically induced resistance against wilt disease of Coleus forskohlii via production of phenolics, the defence enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase, and pathogenesis-related proteins, and peroxidase in response to Fusarium oxysporum infection. G. fasciculatum reduced the disease severity and promoted plant growth significantly (P<0.05) in single-treated and in combination with F. oxysporum-treated plants compared with control plants. The results suggested that G. fasciculatum is a potentially effective protection agent against F. oxysporum.",

The objectives of the present study were to approximate the CCC in a loess hilly region in China's Loess Plateau, analyse its change with bioclimatic gradients, and its validity as a reference for the prediction of carbon sequestration potential. With remnant secondary ecosystems as the basis, an environmental stratification sampling method was used to identify sample sites that covered most of the typical secondary communities in the Yanhe River catchment. Then a classification method was used to predict the above-ground CCC, and a generalized additive modelling approach was used to estimate the below-ground CCC in the Yanhe River catchment. The result showed that the above-ground CCC varied from 0.25 to 39.51 t ha−1 across the catchment with an average of 4.12 ±9.26 t ha−1, and the below-ground CCC (0–60 cm) varied from 14.73 to 182.99 t ha−1 across the catchment with an average of 35.62±12.82 t ha−1. If covered with natural secondary communities, the predicted total CCC of the catchment was 32.77×106 t, of which the above-ground stock accounted for 10% and below-ground stock accounted for 90%.This result may be valuable for accounting carbon stocks and fluxes and provide support for the development of improved management directions and landscape planning.",

The investigations were conducted in northern Zambia at Misamfu Regional Research Centre, Kasama on a Misamfu red sandy loam soil. The experimental design was a split plot arrangement with four replications with main plots receiving 0 and 2 Mg ha−1 dolomitic limestone, while subplots received fertilizer N at various rates. Significant (p < 0.001) grain and DM yield responses to applied N up to 160 kg ha−1 were observed. At higher rates little or no crop responses were observed and fertilizer use efficiency declined. Partitioning of amounts of total N and 15N in plants was in the order of seed = tassel > leaf> cob = earleaf> stem. Fertilizer N rates showed a highly significant (p < 0.001) effect on plant uptake of labelled N. Lime and its interaction with N rates had no effect on all measured parameters. Leaching of NO3-N fertilizer to lower soil depths was in proportion to the rate of N applied, with highly significant (p < 0.001) differences among soil depths. Although higher concentrations of fertilizer-15N were recovered in the 0–20 cm depth the recovered portion at lower soil depths was still significant. Total recovery of labelled N by plant and by soil after crop harvest averaged 75, 55 and 54% of originally applied fertilizer-15N at 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha−1, respectively. Corresponding unaccounted for 15N was 25, 45 and 46%. The most probable loss mechanism could have been by leaching to depths greater than 60 cm, gaseous losses to the atmosphere and root assimilation.",

    "abstract": "At the request of the Danish Environmental Protection Agency a scenario discussion about the possibilities of 100% organic conversion of Danish agriculture was published in spring 1999. In the scenario it was concluded that the most limiting factor regarding such a conversion, was a requirement of potassium (K) import to Denmark necessary to obtain reasonable yields in clover leys which are also the principal nitrogen source in the scenario. At the time of the scenario review, there were no Danish data available on organic agriculture independent of nutrients imported through conventionally produced feed, manure and straw etc. However, since the scenario development, organic farming benchmark experiments have been established. A review of these experiments reveals that the manure applied is conventionally produced and not originate from within the experiments. At the same time the K content in the produced crops is reduced by 20-40% compared to Danish standard values. Therefore, using conventionally produced manure based on conventional fodder implies that considerably more K is allocated than available if experimentally produced fodder was the basis for the manure. Thus important system feedbacks are missing. Hence, to gain knowledge about soil fertility in Danish organic agriculture, not dependent on industrial fertilizers, a few but important changes in the benchmark experiments could be considered. First and foremost, the manure used at an individual experimental plot must reflect the harvested crops from the self-same plot, i.e. separate feeding procedures and collection of manure, corresponding to the individual plots may have to be carried out, of at the very least an assessment of maximum permissible nutrient content in added manure should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Net photosynthetic CO uptake by whole plants of five lupin species 2 ( Lupinus albus L., Lupinus angustifolius L., Lupinus luteus L., Lupinus mutabilis Sweet. and Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.) was measured and modelled in laboratory conditions by an infrared gas analyser at six levels of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD: 0, 176, 352, 528, 704 and 880 w mol m -2 s -1 ) and four temperatures (5, 17, 22 and 29°;C). Measured net photosynthetic CO 2 uptake for all lupin species in all experimental conditions was 10.34 mg CO 2 dm -2 h -1 with a standard deviation ( - SD) of 10.24 and standard error ( - SE) of 0.71 mg CO 2 dm -2 h-1 . The mean value of net photosynthetic CO 2 uptake in all experimental conditions was 9.86 for L. albus , 12.71 for L. angustifolius , 10.92 for L. luteus , 7.77 for L. mutabilis and 10.04 CO 2 dm -2 h -1 for L. polyphyllus . A hyperbolic equation was formulated to illustrate the relationship between light and temperature as independent variables and net photosynthetic CO 2 fixation as the dependent variables ( r 2 =0.91). At temperatures from 17.1 to 20.1°;C and level of PPFD of 880 w mol m -2 s -1 the maximal net photosynthesis varied from 25.0 to 27.0 mg CO 2 dm -2 h -1 depending on species (25.0 for L. albus , 26.0 for L. angustifolius and L. luteus , 27.0 for L. mutabilis and 26.7 for L. polyphyllus ). The differences in net photosynthetic CO 2 fixation were more clearly observed at low temperatures (9.2–;12.5°;C) and at a low level of PPFD (220 w mol m -2 s -1 ), and varied from 9.1 to 12.2 mg CO 2 dm -2 h -1 ( L. albus 9.1, L. angusti folius 10.6, L. luteus 11.0, L. mutabilis 12.2 and L. polyphyllus 12.0). It is concluded that the response of net photosynthetic CO 2 fixation to parameters of light and temperature can be used in the ecological description of lupin species diversity. Future studies are needed to clarify this response at both the cellular and molecular levels.

Three N rates (25, 50 or 75 kg N ha−1) at the start of growth were combined with four N rates (0, 25, 50 or 75 kg N ha−1) at the start of tiller elongation (Z 31). On average for all trials, the highest seed yield was obtained when a total rate of 75 kg N ha−1 was split into a main application of 50 kg N ha−1 at the start of growth and a supplemental application of 25 kg N ha−1 at Z 31. In both cultivars, the optimal N rate at Z 31 was uncorrelated with soil mineral N (NO3+NH4) in early spring and only weakly correlated (r 2=0.16–0.17, p% = 2–5) with the N concentration of aboveground plant material at Z 31. In ‘Grindstad’, a better correlation (r 2=0.46, p% < 0.1) was obtained between the optimal N rate at Z 31 and measurements by the hand-held chlorophyll meter Hydro N-Tester™ on the last fully developed leaf. The equation (HTN model) Optimal N input (kg N ha −1 ) at Z 31 = − 0.37×measured HNT value at Z 31+156 was further evaluated in ten on-farm trials during 2001–2002. Compared to the fixed N levels 0, 25 or 50 kg N ha−1, the HNT model predicted optimal N rates at Z 31 in 2002, but not in 2001, when less rainfall caused less lodging than in 1998–2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, we conclude: 1) that the spring N rates to timothy seed crops should be split into an early and a late application, and 2) that the HTN model will help in adjusting the second N rate at Z 31 in ‘Grindstad’.",

Three disease risk models were tested in thirty–three ﬁeld trials during two seasons in ﬁve countries in order to validate and identify situations favourable for barley leaf blotch diseases in the Nordic–Baltic region. The tested models were: The Crop Protection Online (CPO), which uses number of days with precipitation (>1 mm), cultivar resistance and disease data as basis for risk assessments; the humidity model (HM) which signals a risk warning after 20 continuous hours with high humidity, and the Finnish net blotch model (WisuEnnuste), which calculates a risk based on previous crop, tillage method, cultivar resistance and weather parameters. The risk models mostly gave acceptable control of diseases and yield responses compared with untreated and reference treatments. In the dry season of 2018, the models recommended 88–96% fewer applications than the reference treatments, while in 2019, the number of applications was reduced by 0–76% compared to reference treatments. Based on yield increases, the recommendations were correct in 50–69% of the trials compared to one–treatment references and 69–80% of the trials when references used mainly two treatments.",

    "abstract": "Faba bean is susceptible to several leaf diseases caused by pathogenic fungi. With the increasing importance of faba bean in northern European cropping systems, the importance of its leaf diseases is likely to increase. The aim of this study was to discriminate the diseases and to test agronomic strategies for limiting their spread in a five-year experiment. Chocolate spot disease caused by Botrytis spp. and leaf blotches caused by an Alternaria/Stemphylium complex dominated, the severity of rust was lower, and downy mildew occurred in only one year. The severity of the diseases depended on weather conditions and cultivar, but not on sowing rate. Application of fungicides significantly decreased the severity of chocolate spot, leaf blotch and rust, but not downy mildew, and in no case was the disease progress stopped. None of the cultivars showed strong resistance to disease. The Alternaria/Stemphylium leaf blotch is an emerging disease of faba bean in northern Europe. Work continues on the identification of the responsible species in the chocolate spot and leaf blotch complexes and the determination of their relative importance in causing disease.",

For in vitro egg masses hatching experiment, four different concentrations of aqueous extracts of weed leaves, i.e. 100%, 50%, 10%, and 1%, were analyzed. All the extracts showed varied but significant results over control (Distilled water). Furthermore, C. procera and R. communis treatment significantly inhibited J2s hatching (100% inhibition) at the 4th and 7th days of incubation in 100% concentration, while C. esculenta inhibited the least. In pot study, it was also found that the pots treated with 50 and 100 g dry leaf powder of C. procera has efficiently suppressed the root-knot disease in spinach and significantly increased growth in terms of length, fresh and dry weights, number of leaves and biochemical parameters such as chlorophyll, carotenoid content and nitrate reductase activity followed by A. aspera, L. camara, R. communis, W. chinensis while C. esculenta showed the least effect amongst the treatments. Thus, the results provide considerable data for the use of weed plants to manage the root-gall disease in spinach.",

Therefore, Distributed and parallel simulation Framework (DPSF) with the Internet of Things (IoT) Assistance is proposed for pest control and crop monitoring system. It reduces the stress on a single GPU and shares the process equally and simultaneously to the available GPUs and views data on the dashboard without crashing. The Technique will reduce the execution time. DPSF uses multi-threading concept, in which each core in GPU shares tasks to other cores. This process is done in four layers; each layer is shared to handle the specific task– Crop management, Pest detection and control, Output functions and input functions. The data is processed simultaneously and managed in an optimised and controlled fashion. Simulation analysis shows that the DPSF with IoT Assistance can classify and control pest effectively with IoT assistance.",

The tunnel system offers several advantages, e.g., it is possible to control water supply and thereby introduce drought at proven optimum times, restrict geneflow through insect- and pollen-proof netting, raise the temperature to prolong the growing season and hence the crop duration, and reduce pest attack by preventing pest entrance to the tunnel. In an experiment, tunnel production of open-pollinated carrot varieties increased the yield and germination percentages when compared with normal field conditions. Yield was in the range of 100–250 g and 2–17 g seeds m−2 respectively, and germination percentage was 84–95 and 43–55, respectively. However, hybrid carrot seed production showed lower yields than did their open-pollinated counterparts. Yields ranging from 60–123 g seeds m−2 can be obtained, but the production needs to be carefully planned and monitored.",

Partitioning of the variance component estimated that the environment had its main impact on the performance of traits like plant height, catalase, and relative water content, while superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, membrane stability index, and K+/Na+ ratio were genetically influenced. Considering the wide variability and high heritability calculated, progress could be expected from selection based on catalase, membrane stability index, and K+/Na+ ratio.",

In this study, a loam soil was amended with cabbage residues and the N mineralization from soil organic matter and residues, as well as N uptake by Italian rye grass, were investigated. Four mineral fertilizer-residue combination treatments and two application times were tested in micro-plots. For uncropped micro-plots, application of residue resulted in higher soil mineral N content (43 mg N kg−1, 63 days post application) versus 30.5 mg N kg−1 for an unamended soil. Both bulked dry matter production and N uptake by the rye grass decreased in the order full mineral fertilizer > half mineral fertilizer + half residue > full residue applied 3 weeks before sowing > full residue applied at sowing, but the differences were more pronounced in the N uptake. Shoot N recovery from the applied residue (27.5–31.4%) was much smaller than that from the full fertilizer (70.2%), but was still considerable. Apparent net N mineralization from soil organic matter was significantly depressed in the treatments where mineral fertilizer was added. Cropping also reduced apparent net N mineralization, but this effect was reduced when residues were applied 3 weeks before sowing. Results showed that crop residues play an important role in crop production, in terms of obtaining comparable dry matter production to that of full mineral fertilizer application. Moreover, nitrogen supplied as residue is less liable for loss due to leaching during the growing season. The efficiency of crop uptake to residue-derived nitrogen could be increased by earlier application time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The relationships between soil nutrient concentrations, plant nutrient contents, and soil properties were investigated in carrot (Daucus carota L.) fields in Konya-Kaşınhanı (Turkey). The soils were high in clay content, slightly alkaline, and were moderate to high in CaCO3 content. The soils had sufficient N, Ca, Mg, K, and Fe, but did not have adequate Zn or B for plant growth. The carrots had moderate to high concentrations of Mg, B, Fe, and Zn; however, they had low concentrations of K, Ca, and N. The Cd-content of the soils ranged between 0.06 and 0.91 mg/kg (with a mean of 0.33 mg/kg). The Cd-content of the carrot leaves and organic matter content of the soils were significantly correlated (r= − 0.351, p<0.05). Zinc deficiency is a major problem in carrot fields of Konya. Excessive phosphorus fertilization did not seem to result in Cd-pollution of soil or potentially toxic Cd-levels in carrots. The high pH and CaCO3 contents of the calcareous soils lead to stabilization of heavy metals; however, they also result in reduced availability of many plant nutrients. Consequently, soil-management practices, which will increase the availability of plant nutrients in calcareous soils, need to be investigated. Sulfur fertilization could be a way to reduce soil pH to neutrality as a result of oxidation of added sulfur temporarily in calcareous soils.",

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) tests were used for PVY and PLRV screening during two years that were characterized by intensive virus incidence and severity in the field, while foliar and tuber resistances to late blight were assessed under artificial inoculation with an aggressive Swedish isolate of P. infestans. Hybrid seeds were obtained by crossing cultivars such as ‘Kiva’, ‘Sarpo Mira’, ‘Rosamunda’ and ‘Superb’ with SLU advanced breeding clones and a selected clone of Solanum tuberosum Group Andigena. Some cultivars (‘Hårek’, ‘Sarpo Mira’) and breeding clones (04-2662, 04-2085) with late blight resistance did not show virus infection. The α-solanin and α-chaconin contents of some of the old Nordic potato cultivars and breeding clones were similar to the known Dutch table cultivar ‘Bintje’ after 3 years of testing. This research allows identification of promising Nordic potato cultivars and SLU breeding clones for further use in developing germplasm aiming at organic and conventional farming systems.",

Therefore, the aim of this study is to study whether root and root hairs grown in solution culture can predict their behavior in soil and their correlation with macro- and micronutrients uptake of wheat genotypes.Materials and methods: The growth of roots and root hairs as well as uptake of macro- and micronutrients of six spring wheat varieties was compared in solution culture under P stress and P abundance and in a low fertility soil.Results and conclusions: Root length and surface area under P stress were significantly positively correlated with that in the low fertility soil, while no such correlation was apparent for root hair length and density. In absolute terms, the root length, surface area, root hair length and density of spring wheat varieties were substantially higher in soil than in solution culture, while the concentration and uptake of macro- and micronutrients in soil differed from solution culture in a complex way. The early uptake of macro- and micronutrients was intimately associated with root length and surface area as well as root hair length and density in soil but not in solution culture. Therefore, root length rather than root hair traits in low-P solution may be used to screen early root growth vigor in soil and thereby high nutrient uptake of wheat in low fertility soil.",

Results demonstrate that soil contamination with heavy metals have a negative effect on tomato fruits characteristics, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, lycopene, ascorbic acid, micro-elements and carbohydrates content. Moreover, fruits originated from plants grown in contaminated soil possess high phenols and flavonoids contents and higher heavy metals content compared to control fruits.

    "abstract": "Bacillus pumilus WP8 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) with good biocontrol efficacy against tomato bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum Rs1115. Biocontrol, however, is not due to antagonism of the pathogenic bacterium. Thus, we hypothesised that the biocontrol efficacy of WP8 was achieved by attenuation of Rs1115 virulence. Here, pot experiments for comparison of Rs1115 in different plant parts were conducted to investigate the ability of WP8 to prevent entry of Rs1115 into the regions of the plant above ground. Primary and secondary metabolite contents of WP8 and their inhibitory effects on twitching and swarming motilities of Rs1115 were determined by microscopic examination and crystal violet staining. The effects of WP8 metabolites on the expression of typical virulence genes in Rs1115 were established by quantitative PCR. Rs1115 abundance in the rhizosphere increased with time after inoculation. However, the shoots treated with WP8 were pathogen-free on days 3 and 6 after inoculation. In the WP8 + Rs1115 treatment group, the abundance of Rs1115 in shoots was 1.5 lg units higher on day 9 post-inoculation than that in the Rs1115 treatment group, while less Rs1115 was observed in the leaves. This indicated that WP8 prevented Rs1115 from spreading to the regions of the plant above ground. Furthermore, some heat-resistant secondary metabolites of WP8 (e.g. lipopeptides) inhibited the twitching and swarming motility of Rs1115. Moreover, the metabolites decreased the expression of typical virulence genes in Rs1115. Therefore, WP8 was shown to attenuate Rs1115 virulence, possibly through pumilacidin secretion.",

The research aims to investigate the effect of elicitors as salicylic acid and Bacillus subtilis strain JN2-007 for inducing resistance against root rot disease by Fusarium solani in cassava. The experiment was carried out in a susceptible cassava cultivar to test the efficacy of elicitors in the biochemical response of plant defense mechanisms pertaining to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and enzyme activities. The results indicated that pathogenicity test of F. solani isolate SHRD1 caused the brown lesions around the inoculation point on cassava roots. Subsequently, salicylic acid and JN2-007 reduced mycelial growth of F. solani (11.83%–57.73% at day 7), as well as disease severity in the cassava plants at 14 days after the inoculation compared to that of the negative control (28.12%–39.58% compared to 68.75%). Furthermore, salicylic acid at a concentration of 500 µl. L−1 could induce H2O2, level of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and catalase activities that were highest at 24 h after pathogen inoculation. The results suggested that elicitors played an important role as a plant defense inducer, leading to reduced Fusarium root rot disease.",

Simultaneously, there is an interest to recycle organic waste materials in the form of compost. This study aimed to document effects on growth, yield, and fruit quality of tomato plants when cultivated in a sewage digestate-based compost in a subirrigation container system. Materials and methods: The compost used in this experiment consisted of 30% hygienised sewage digestate from biogas extraction and 70% garden waste. The treatments were 100% compost, a peat mix and mixtures of the two in 25/75, 50/50 and 75/25 ratios. Results and conclusion: Considering the contrast in chemical and physical properties of the treatments, variations in growth, yield and quality were expected. The plants differed in leaf area and number of leaves, but there were no differences in yield or quality of the tomato fruits. It is assumed that this is in great part due to the remediating effects of subirrigation with an ideal nutrient solution, and the use of pre-established plants. Further research should focus on benefits of this cultivation system for use in sustainable horticulture in combination with recycled organic waste.",

Furthermore, somatic hybridization provides novel possibilities for modifying the organelle composition of plants. Genetic engineering for crop improvements and fundamental studies in plant biology involve isolation of genes, studies of gene expression and gene regulation. In order to change or improve agronomically desirable traits, or to investigate further specific gene functions, methods for transfer of cloned genes into plants have developed. Furthermore, cryopreservation would enable conservation of genetic material, including genetically modified plants deriving from various biotechnological manipulations.",

In peas, spring barley and spring oilseed rape, yield responses to E. repens interference were closely related to E. repens shoot biomass pre-harvest. Also the number of E. repens spikes pre-harvest was related to crop yield, although the correlations were not as high. In winter wheat and winter rye, the correlations, with both shoot biomass and spike number, were smaller than in the spring-sown crops, but still significant. In all crops, the relationships interacted with years but the interactions were not statistically significant in many cases. Mechanical control in the stubble and pre- or post-harvest application of glyphosate are common control measures against E. repens, and pre-harvest assessments of E. repens infestations show promise for judging the seriousness of a current E. repens problem before making control decisions.

This study was conducted to determine whether soil air-filled porosity (AFP), nitrate concentration and N management could explain some of the large variation found in denitrification studies. Denitrification losses from a coarse sandy soil and a sandy loam soil under spring barley were measured during a three-year period using the acetylene-based static soil core method. The sandy loam soil received 100 and 133 kg inorganic N ha−1 yr−1in pig slurry and inorganic fertilizer, respectively, while the coarse sandy soil received 100 and 120 kg inorganic N ha−1yr−1 in pig slurry and inorganic fertilizer, respectively. In the coarse sandy soil no interaction between soil AFP and soil nitrate concentration in relation to denitrification existed during the three years investigated, and annual losses arising from denitrification were low (<1 kg N ha−1). In this soil type the low denitrification loss from the plot treated with slurry is explained by the inability of the slurry to create hot spots owing to the slurry incorporation technique (harrowing) and to the amount of slurry used (30 Mg). Annual losses arising from denitrification in the sandy loam soil were in the order inorganic fertilized > slurry fertilized > control. In this soil type a linear relationship between log10 denitrification activity and air-filled porosity could explain 50% of the variation in denitrification activity, but no influence of soil nitrate concentration was found. The regression parameters for the AFP regression varied between unamended and amended soil, with the highest slope in the amended soil regression.",

The concentration of total P and TRP increased with decreasing particle size. The effect of increasing amounts of added P on the P content in the different particle-size fractions was examined, and it was found that the excess of added P was concentrated in the clay fraction. This resulted in higher enrichment ratios of both total P and TRP with increasing P additions. The part of total P that was algal-available increased significantly with the increasing level of P fertilization.",

With maize (Zea mays L.) as the non‐N2‐fixing control, the percentage of N2 fixed predicted by the 15N‐dilution method was significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher than that predicted by the N‐difference method. However, the N2 amounts predicted by the two methods were not significantly different. The correlation between the two methods was significant and positive (P ≤ 0.0001, n = 36). Compared with the native rhizobial strain, symbiotic associations of the bean cultivars with UMR1073, UMR1077 and UMR1899 rhizobial inoculants did not significantly (P ≤ 0.05) influence plant dry matter (DM) and N yields, the extent of N2 fixation and uptake of soil and fertilizer N. Nevertheless, the UMR1077 and UMR1899 strains markedly increased the uptake of soil N by R84 plants, while decreasing N2 fixation. In contrast, the Imba‐UMR1899 association enhanced positive effects on all variables. About 60–70% of the total N taken up by the Imba plants was fixed N2. The R79 and R84 plants fixed about 50% of their total N uptake. N2 fixation rates were positively correlated with DM and total N yields, while being negatively correlated with soil N uptake (P ≤ 0.001, n = 36). Future research in Nicaragua should focus on selecting rhizobial strains suitable for indigenous common bean cultivars.",

The nitrate content in plant stem tissue sap collected at Zadoks growth stages GS 31 and GS 49 of winter wheat in 11 annual field trials in south-east Norway in the years 1993-96 was measured with Merckoquant test strips with a Nitracheck Meter. Relationships between NO3 - concentrations and final yields were good within individual trials, but when the results from all trials were pooled, the NO3 - concentration was a poor predictor of final yields. This study suggests that the critical nitrate values required in plant stem sap for sufficient grain protein content for bread-baking quality are 4000 ppm NO3 - at GS 31 and 2000 ppm at GS 49 in situations with a single N application in the spring. In situations with split N applications (25 kg N ha-1 at GS 31 and 25 kg N ha-1 at GS 49 in addition to spring application), 1000 and 500 ppm were found to be the critical values at GS 31 and 49, respectively. Because of the large between-site and between-year variability, this study does not indicate that the method can be recommended for extended practical use.",

This paper describes a regression model managed by climate variables, which incorporate the biology of the bird cherry-oat aphid on its primary host, the bird cherry (Prunus padus L.). In the period 1987-1998, three to nine spring barley fields were monitored annually for the first occurrence of bird cherry-oat aphid. Different climatic variables were analysed in relation to the time of arrival, with a view to constructing a model. The analysis showed good correlation between the date of arrival into the fields after 1 May (D), day-degrees (DD) in February (TF), DD in March (TM), DD in April (TA), precipitation in April (PA) and precipitation in May until 15th (PM) according to the following model: D = 0.61TF - 0.17TM + 0.30TA - 0.46PA + 1.85PM (r 2=0.98, P<0.001, df=51). DD were calculated with a threshold temperature of 3°C. It is concluded that the model gives a prognosis of the time of arrival of bird cherry-oat aphid in spring barley fields sufficiently reliable to serve as a decision-making tool in managing problems with bird cherry-oat aphids.",

Despite the fact that the various mulches differed in their effects on soil temperature, these differences had no apparent effects on root growth, indicating that the black currant plant can grow well over a wide range of soil temperatures.",

Most attention was paid to winter‐hardiness, resistance to diseases and pests, and ornamental value. The data were analysed using both statistical and non‐statistical methods. A combination of these proved to be a successful method for selecting the clones with the highest value for production. Nine clones were selected as recommendable clones. The Hydrangea paniculata cultivars ‘Grandiflora’, ‘Praecox’ and ‘Mustila’ were found to be valuable and recommendable. Several Lonicera clones succeeded well and were renamed. Three clones were selected as being suitable for different purposes: L. tatarica ’Sanna’ suits well for hedges, L. x bella ’Dropmore’ is white‐flowered, and L. x bella ’Sakura’ has a special growth habit. A true‐to‐type Philadelphus pubescens clone was renamed ‘Tuomas’ and an abundantly blossoming and hardy P. lewisii hybrid was renamed ‘Tähtisilmä’. Finnish Viburnum opulus clones representing a hardy type with plenty of blossoms were renamed ‘Pohjan Neito’.",

Autumn treatments released some compensatory development of trusses and an even greater development of vegetative parts the following summer. Fruit size was increased in two out of four experiments and ripening was promoted in some cases. Treatments at bloom ('Elsanta') rendered only small influences. Removals of leaves, crowns and trusses released a small compensatory increase in fruit numbers, the two latter treatments increased fruit size by about 14%. Light reduction did not affect fruit development. Removal of the three largest flowers per truss released a compensatory development of inferior flowers which otherwise remained undeveloped. When concentrations of soluble solids and acids were measured, effects were small or absent. It is concluded that effects are due to a releived competition for root-mediated factors more than for assimilates.",

In the first and second years the DM yields and the amounts of sulphur removed by the herbage were significantly lower at plots treated with pyrite than at sulphate‐treated plots. In the residual year the highest yields of DM and sulphur were obtained after application of FeS2. The present experiments indicated that sulphur in pyrites was less plant available than similar amounts of sulphur supplied as sulphates. However, use of pyrite increased yields of DM and sulphur from the second year on, compared to no application of sulphur. The ratio N/S was strongly influenced by sulphur fertilization. Nitrate‐N concentration was found to be highest in plants grown on soil that was not supplied with sulphur. No increases in the soil or herbage content of hazardous heavy metals were revealed, but it has to be emphasized that the applied amounts of FeS2 were small and that the products were used for only two years.",

In the glossic horizon a distinct redox‐front is observed between albic ped faces adjacent to the macropore lumen and brown ped interiors. Samples, each representing a thickness of 2–3 mm in transects orthogonal to the macropore and the redox‐front, show up to five times more citrate‐bicarbonate‐dithionite extractable Fe and Al (Fed, Ald) in brown ped interiors than in albic ped faces. Surprisingly, the content of total (Ptot) and inorganic phosphorus (Pi) have a nearly uniform distribution across the transects. In the albic ped faces the contents of citrate‐bicarbonate‐dithionite extractable (Pd) and oxalate extractable phosphorus (Pox) are both low whereas the amounts of Pior P extractable by 1 M HC1 (PHC1) are remarkably high. Calculations demonstrate that the low content of Pd is not due to phosphate saturation. The large PHC1 — Pd fraction in ped faces is attributed to occluded P, because the PHC1 — Pd fraction is equivalent to the PHC1 — Pox fraction and oxalate is found able to dissolve apatite. The occluded P is not present within Al and Fe oxides, but probably contained in silicates. In the brown ped interiors most phosphate is bound to crystalline Al and Fe oxides.",

In autumn, seedling age of four weeks gave best results, while in spring the highest yield was obtained from six weeks-old seedlings. It is concluded that planting should not be delayed in both seasons.",

While the total tiller population in most crops increased until seed harvest, it decreased during panicle elongation in crops of Bromus inermis and Festuca pratensis that had reached 2000 and 3500 tillers m−2 in early spring, respectively. Except for the fact that many of the primary tillers of Bromus inermis died after producing barren stems, tillers formed in August and September had the greatest chance of becoming reproductive and produced the longest stems with the heaviest inflorescences in both species. Most tillers produced in winter or early spring either remained vegetative or died, but spring-emerging tillers contributed up to 30% of the total seed yield in early-established, low-density crops of Festuca pratensis. The results are discussed in relation to former papers suggesting that inter-tiller transfer of flower induction stimuli is possible in some perennial grasses. It is concluded that tillers produced in winter and spring contribute more to seed yield in Festuca pratensis than in Bromus inermis.",

Winter rye Vambo and winter wheat Kosack were used as controls. The moisture content of kernels at physiological maturity (PM) was affected by climatic conditions (r=0.38; p<0.05). Germination rate of kernels in spike before PM was influenced by cultivar only up to 17%; mostly it was affected by climatic conditions (coefficient of determination, 54%). Kernel germination rate after PM was dependent on cultivar up to 37%, but was dependent on precipitation amounts in August (coefficient of determination, 60%). The most resistant cultivar to germination during post-physiological maturity period was Modus, followed by Dagro and Prego. Kernels’ germination rate after PM was found to be an appropriate measure for selection of promising triticale cultivars for the climatic conditions, which are specific for the locations studied. The desiccation rate after PM affected significantly the duration of the period from PM up to harvest time (r=−0.50; p<0.01).",

Most of the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) produced is used for pig feed but some is used for malting – the primary step in the production of beer. The effects of fertilizer application method, type and rate on yield and grain quality were investigated in a malting barley crop without the use of pesticides. Twelve treatments where single and multiple nutrient fertilizers were either broadcast or placed in bands by drilling, were compared in a field experiment at two sites in Denmark during 1993–96. Weeds were controlled mechanically in all treatments, and chemical control of foliar fungal diseases and insects was only carried out in two treatments. The placement of a compound NPK-fertilizer increased the grain yield and the quality parameters grain size and grading when weeds are controlled mechanically by harrowing. The effect of fertilizer placement on grain yield and quality decreased in the order NPK > NP > N>P. Herbicide-free growing of malting barley may be possible using fertilizer placement, but the use of chemical control of foliar fungal diseases and insects may be critical when pests exceed certain thresholds as they significantly reduce grain yield, grain size and grading. The aim of growing malting barley satisfactorily without the use of pesticides was only partly met.",

For all three metals, the above mentioned ratio was highest in the city sewage soil and the lowest in the paper mill soil. In general, the extent of contamination among the profiles investigated was in the following order: city sewage>tannery>pharmaceutical>paper mill soil. Higher ratios of DTPA-extractable Cd, Ni and Zn in the city sewage soil than the other soils may create a risk for the contamination of agricultural products and ground water.",

Increasing rates of manure application from 20 to 120 t ha−1 decreases soil seed contents under acidic soil conditions. On the other hand, long-term application of increasing rates of manure did not affect the total number of weeds in limed soil. Number of acidophilic weed species was much lower and plants of Rumex acetosella were not found, but density of nitrophilous weed species increased when long-term application of increasing rates of manure took place in limed soil. Acidophilic weed plants Scleranthus annuus, Spergula arvensis,and Rumex acetosella and their seeds in topsoil dominated in the acid unmanured soil.",

Plants were infected with BYDV-PAV at the two-leaf stage or left uninfected. Two nitrogen fertilization levels were used. BYDV-infected plants had smaller above-ground biomass and a smaller green plant area than uninfected plants. The decreased biomass could be explained by a decrease in leaf area, causing a decreased radiation interception and growth. Relatively higher RUE in the infected plants during a period of the growing season partially compensated for growth reductions due to the smaller leaf area. Increased RUE of the infected plants was related to higher nitrogen concentration per leaf area. The effects of an infection were similar for the two nitrogen fertilization treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The strategy to mitigate phosphorus (P) losses in areas of arable cropping in Norway has focused on measures to reduce erosion. Risk assessment of erosion has formed the basis for implementation of the measures. The soil P content has increased during recent decades, motivating an evaluation of its effect on P transfer in the landscape. The present study describes the spatial variability of runoff P concentrations from an agricultural dominated catchment (4.5 km2), representative for agriculture in south-eastern Norway. The concentrations of suspended sediments (SS), total P (TP) and dissolved reactive P (DRP) in runoff from 22 subcatchments (0.3–263 ha) during one year (monthly and during runoff-events) were evaluated. Contributions from point sources were 38 kg TP yr−1 compared to a total P loss of 685 kg yr−1 from the whole catchment. During low flow, mean diffuse TP concentration in runoff from subcatchments varied from 28 to 382 µg l−1. The mean low flow TP concentration was 39 µg l−1 from the housing area (only diffuse runoff) and 33 µg l−1 from the forested area. During high flow the highest diffuse TP concentration was measured in an area with high erosion risk and high soil P status. At the subcatchment level the transfer of SS varied from 25 to 175% of the whole catchment SS transfer. Correspondingly for TP, the transfer varied from 50 to 260% of the whole catchment TP transfer. For each of five agricultural subcatchments the slope of the relationship between TP and SS concentrations reflected the mean soil P status of the subcatchment. Erosion risk estimates were closely related to the SS concentration (R2=0.83). The study illustrates that soil P status in addition to soil erosion is an important factor for P transfer.",

The results showed that 21 bee species were identified visiting O. syriacum flowers, of which 8 species were recorded for the first time in Jordan. Supplementary pollination produced a higher significant number of seeds and seed set than other pollination treatments that led us to conclude that O. syriacum flowers are affected by pollen shortage under natural conditions. Wind plays little or no role in its pollination process. There is low seed yield production and seed set by O. syriacum under natural conditions in Jordan.

Regression coefficients showed in these experiments that the optimum time for canopy reflectance measurements was from approximately 600 cumulative growing degree-days (CGDD) to approximately 900 CGDD. This is the period just before and at heading of the seed crop. Furthermore, regression coefficients showed that information about N and water is important. The results support the development of an additional N- and water-application model which will calculate the application rate of N and water according to expected seed yield.",

It was therefore of interest to analyse radiation-use efficiency (RUE) and root allocation (br) in one-, two-, and three-year-old red clover–grass leys as functions of growth period (first and second growth, ley age), proportion of clover, and site properties (location, soil type, humus content). By calibrating RUE and br, the ley yields simulated with a growth model were adjusted to the values observed during two consecutive years at 33 organic farms located in the southern and the northwestern coastal regions of Finland. Driving variables of the simulations were daily measurements of weather. RUE declined from the first to the second growth and further with ley age, while its variability increased. The value of br decreased from the first to the second growth, and was positively correlated with RUE. The high variability of RUE between different sites, and the absence of correlations between site properties and RUE, were mainly attributable to differences in overwintering and regrowth conditions. Early measurements of above-ground biomass subsequent to overwintering and cutting, and the inclusion of site-specific measurements of soil properties would have increased the general validity of the calibrated parameter values. RUE correlated positively with proportion of clover. However, the increase of the proportion of clover from the first to the second growth was not strong enough to balance the concurrent decline of RUE. With increasing ley age there were two concurrent and reinforcing patterns, namely a decrease in proportion of clover and in RUE. Thus, both symbiotic N fixation and vigour of perennial red clover–grass leys declined with ley age. With regards to RUE, however, three-year-old leys were still productive.",

The effects of air temperature from sowing to resumption of vegetation were determined using correlation analysis on the infection level of common bunt in winter wheat. A significant correlation between the mean nursery infection and daily mean temperature had a maximum value on the 36th day (r=0.60) at a 30–190-day interval after sowing. The minimum value was detected on the 150th day (r = -0.65) at a 150–190-day interval after sowing. The calculation of multi-intervals of mean temperatures allowed us to highlight the actual influence of temperature on the final level of common bunt infection. Cross-comparison of 6 contrasting years indicated that the impact of post-sowing temperatures was low. This was proved in 1994, 1998, and 2006 with similar temperatures but considerable differences in final infection levels – 46.9, 6.8, and 80.9%, respectively. Of the 6 test years only post-sowing temperatures in the autumn of the year 2003 were unfavourable for initial infection. The mean infection level was low when heavy frosts occurred together with a thin snow cover in 1995 (8.6%), 1998 (6.8%), and 2004 (8.9%). A high infection level occurred when heavy frosts coincided with a thicker snow cover in 1994 (46.9%), 1999 (22.9%), and 2006 (80.9%).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The potential for extending organic wine production in Chile is discussed in relation to its history and present situation. The main objective is to present an overview of the production of organic wine in Chile, its certification, and national and international markets. During the wine harvesting season in March and April 2006, the authors visited and interviewed staff at four Chilean organic wineries. The wineries were all situated in the wine-producing centre of the country and were of variable sizes. One of the certification bodies in Chile was also interviewed. In addition to the field studies and interviews in Chile, various written information has been used. Second to Argentina, Chile is the country that produces most wine in Latin America. Vineyards cover a total of 110 000 hectares of the country's two million hectares of arable land. A study carried out in 2005 showed that 2000 hectares (almost 2%) of vineyards are organically cultivated. The organic production is operated by 32 different companies, which produce organic wine mainly for exportation to the international market. In Chile, the number of certified organic wine producers has increased in recent years in a trend directed by international demand and possible competitive advantages for Chilean wines. In order for a wine to be called ‘organic’ or ‘wine made from organically grown grapes’, the cultivation and final product must be approved by a certification company. In Chile there are three main active certification bodies; one national (Certificadora Chile Orgánico, CCO) and two international (the Swiss company IMO and the German company BCS). The study reveals a country with innovation and energy but facing strong pressures from the international market and its jungle of laws and directives, and the differing prestige of different certifications and labels. Chile as a wine-producing country has many competitors, and the production of organic wine could be a way to find diversity and exploit new market ground where environmental consideration concerns and sustainability are important targets.",

Molecular analysis confirmed the integration and transcripts of the alfAFP gene in the genome of 12 transformants. In vitro assays showed that crude leaf extracts from transformants was able to significantly (p<0.01) inhibit the growth and proliferation of V. dahliae compared to the extracts from control plants. In vivo assays with fungal pathogens showed that transformants displayed a significant reduction in their disease symptoms compared to control plants. These results suggest that the alfAFP gene was expressed in the upland cotton and its product of gene expression was active in the growth inhibition of V. dahliae.",

Flowers of Prosopis were subjected to two pollination treatments: 1) open pollination and 2) supplementary pollination at different flowering dates from September to January. Number of racemes per node, number of flowers per raceme, pod per raceme, pod length and weight, seed number per pod, 100-seed weight, and total seed yield per node were measured. Prosopis trees produced an average of 6 racemes per node. Supplementary pollinated flowers had higher pod number/raceme but lower pod length and weight in comparison with open pollinated at all flowering dates except for January. Pollination treatment did not influence seed number or characteristics. These data suggest that although supplementary pollination increased pod set per raceme, bee pollination gave the same pollination efficiency and better pod quality.",

In October 2003, soil samples were collected from the 0–5, 5–10, 10–25 cm depths in the treatments: no tillage (NT); disked once each spring (DO); disked twice (each for spring and fall, respectively) (DT); straw and stubble retention (SS); straw and stubble removal (NSS); and 11 and 131 kg N ha−1 nitrogen fertilizer application rates, to determine soil total nitrogen and carbon concentration, cation exchange capacity, mineral N, Mehlich-3 extractable phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, pH, electrical conductivity and bulk density. From 1983 to 2003 grain yield was measured from each treatment except in those years in which yield was lost due to birds, weeds, or chemical fallow. The no-tillage treatment tended to increase soil total organic C and N concentrations at 0–5 cm depths. Soil bulk density (0–5 cm) was lower with NT (p<0.05) than with DT. Retaining straw (SS) on the soil surface increased soil organic C concentration at 5–10 cm depth (p=0.06). Mineral N concentration in soil was higher with NT at 0–5 cm depth (p=0.05). Barley grain yield of NT was better than that of DT but varied with time. Rate of N application increased grain yield up to 91 kg N ha−1. Overall, the no-tillage and straw management had impact on some surface soil properties in sub-arctic Alaska, and no-tillage and minimum tillage increased barley crop yield.",

In the present study, spring and winter triticale were comparatively studied to evaluate the influence of N fertilisation intensity on the productivity and bioethanol yield, as well as to assess the relationship between the meteorological factors and ethanol yield. Six treatments of N – 0, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 kg ha−1 were compared in spring triticale and in winter triticale crops. The analysis of variance showed that nitrogen level (factor A), year (factor B) and their interaction (A × B) significantly (P ≤ .01) influenced grain yield, starch yield and bioethanol yield of both spring and winter triticale. Fertilisation was the main factor explaining 47.6% and 41.0% of the total variability of bioethanol yield of spring and winter triticale, respectively. Nitrogen fertiliser rates 120–180 kg ha−1 resulted in maximum bioethanol yield of spring triticale (2417–2480 l ha−1) and winter triticale (4311–4420 l ha−1). Bioethanol conversion efficiency of nitrogen-fertilised spring and winter triticale was similar 492 l t−1 and 508 l −1, respectively. Meteorological factors had a greater impact on grain productivity and bioethanol yield for winter triticale than for spring triticale. Both seasonal types of triticale could be good feedstocks for bioethanol production in the areas with congenial weather conditions for their cultivation.",

The objective of the study was to assess the effects of mulching and Striga infestation on sorghum chlorophyll content, Striga attachments, sorghum height, and yield. The 2 × 2 × 10 factorial experiment was replicated three times for two seasons. The pot experiment was laid out as a completely randomised design. The first factor was mulching at 0 and 3 tons/ha. The second factor was infestation at two levels: infested and uninfested while the third factor was sorghum varieties at 10 levels. Data collected was plant height, chlorophyll content, Striga counts and sorghum yield. Results indicated that mulching increased chlorophyll content in the second season and not first. Infestation reduced chlorophyll content in both seasons. For the second season, mulching increased chlorophyll content in all genotypes except Ruzangwaya, Mukadziusaende and SC Sila. The genotypes Mukadziusaende, Chiredhi and Hlubi were able to maintain height despite infestation by Striga. Generally yield was higher in uninfested pots across all varieties except Mukadziusaende for the first season. Sorghum arundinaceum was highly susceptible to Striga and hence cannot be a source of resistant traits for Sorghum bicolour breeding. Mulching in Striga infested plants increased plant height and chlorophyll content. Mulching tended to diminish the pathological effects of the Striga parasite in some varieties. Therefore, mulching negated the effect of Striga parasitism and resulted in yield maintenance in some genotypes and hence can be taken up by farmers in Striga infested areas as a beneficial cultural practice.",

In Trial 1, the dose rate of E4FO was determined to optimise male sterility. In this experiment three genotypes were tested at E4FO dose rates. In Trial 2 the frequency of application of E4FO was determined using three sweet stem sorghum genotypes, three E4FO doses, and six frequencies of application. Data on sterility was inferred based on seed set and seed count from the treated plants. Male sterility was achieved when E4FO was applied during heading stage using the following rates: 1 g l−1, 1.5 g l−1 and 2 g l−1, with more than one application. Applying E4FO twice during the heading stage at a rate of 2 g l−1 would induce male sterility in the tested sweet stem sorghum genotypes, a result that could be useful in hybrid breeding programmes.",

The cultures were maintained under a 16 h photoperiod under white, red or blue fluorescent light, at 20 ± 2°C for 12 weeks. This study aimed to determine the most suitable light conditions and medium composition for seed-derived callus explants in order to obtain an efficient formation of adventitious bulbs. There were no differences between the spectra of light in differentiating adventitious bulbs. Explants cultured in darkness (control), on 0.5 µM BAP and 3% sucrose, formed the highest number of adventitious bulbs. The efficiency of adventitious organogenesis amounted to 36.6 bulbs per 1 g of callus tissue. The fresh weight of biomass, cultured in these conditions, increased within 12 weeks from 1 to 6.99 g. Supplementation with BAP of the medium containing 3% sucrose promoted the formation of bulbs, but in the case of the medium with 6% sucrose, BAP had an adverse influence under every type of light.

However, little is known about the effect of these amendments on the soil resistance to detachment. This study assessed the resistance to detachment of soil cores treated with different liming products, using a cohesive strength meter (CSM) which measures the rate of soil detachment under the action of water jets at different pressures. The amount of soil removed by the water jets was taken as an indirect measure of soil resistance to detachment, under the assumption that more resistant soils will lose less material than more susceptible soils at a given water jet pressure. The results showed that all soil amendments studied reduced detachment of particles under the action of water jets compared with unamended soil (control).",

No yield penalty was noticed for the density reductions, thus showing high ability of mixture to recover from physical disturbance.

Conversely, social network analysis comprises the identification of furthermost prestigious and influential actors, so using social network analysis methods, this paper analyses the structural characteristics and dynamic evolution of venture capital (VC) networks in China and the USA from 2002 to 2017, with a focus on the node degree distribution, the network structure entropy, the centrality, the cliques, and the k-core. The findings from a panel dataset shows that, relative to the VC network in the USA, China’s VC network entities are less integrated and less cooperative. Secondly, the degrees of venture capital firms in China and the USA obey the power law distribution, both with unbalanced distribution nodes and significant differences of the weights among different nodes. Based on the venture capital events this study measures the venture capital networks using important indicators and on the basis of this comparative analysis, optimisation strategies of investment networks against the risk are put forward to promote the development of Chinese agricultural science and technology enterprises.",

In this study, N2O emissions were compared among grassland and cropland soils in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia over three growing seasons. Four adjacent sites with different land-use histories were selected, including grassland and croplands cultivated for 5, 10, and 50 years after conversion. N2O flux measurements were obtained using a closed-chamber method and were performed continuously during vegetation periods. After the conversion of grassland to cropland, N2O emission initially decreased and thereafter increased in the study sites. The cumulative N2O emissions of the cropland soils 5 and 10 years in age were 10–50% less than those of the grassland, and the N2O emissions from the cropland soil 50 years in age were 10–30% greater than the grassland. When the seasonal emissions were correlated against single soil parameter, the key soil parameter that affected N2O emissions over the entire growing season was the soil moisture content. When the interactions among soil parameters were considered, the amount of N2O emissions could be quantitatively described by a linear combination of two soil variables, the soil ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and moisture concentrations. This study demonstrates how the time of land use conversion from grassland to cropland can positively or negatively affect N2O emission.",

We quantified the chemical species of As in xylem exudates of rice growing in arsenic-contaminated soil (62.5 mg As per kg soil) under flooded and aerobic conditions. In the aerobic treatment, the predominant species of As in the xylem sap was arsenate [As(V)], accounting for 64–88%, and the remainder was arsenite [As(III)]. In the flooded treatment, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was detected in the xylem sap besides As(III) and As(V), and the percentages of the three species As was 11–20%, 26–77%, and 12–54%, respectively. As speciation in the soil solution was dominated by As(V) under aerobic conditions, and dominated by As(III) under flooded conditions. DMA was detected at low concentrations in some of the flooded solution samples. Our results show that As speciation in the xylem sap differs in different water management regimes and correlate with As speciation in the soil solution strongly.",

    "abstract": "The market for herbage seed straw has diminished in many seed-production areas due to less livestock. Seed growers are therefore looking for alternatives to straw removal, which up to now has been the most common practice. During 2000–2006, different alternative straw chopping methods, both at the back of the combiner and with a tractor-mounted flail-chopper, and field burning strategies were evaluated in seed crops of timothy (Phleum pratense) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis) in southeast Norway. The requirement for an extra N input in autumn (30–40 kg ha-1) when practising straw chopping was also examined. Compared to straw removal, straw chopping at the back of the combiner during seed harvest did not reduce seed yield in the following year as long as stubble height was low (<10 cm in timothy) and the straw spread uniformly in the field. On average, seed yield was 1–4% and 1–9% higher compared to straw removal in timothy and meadow fescue, respectively. If the chopped straw was spread unevenly, or long stubble was left at combining, it is recommended to use a tractor-mounted flail-chopper after harvest. The experiments did not provide any support for an extra input of nitrogen in autumn, either in timothy or meadow fescue, when the straw was chopped rather than removed. Burning of stubble and straw soon after seed harvest was another efficient clean-up method after harvest, which increased seed yield 9–15% and 17–20% compared to straw removal in the two species, respectively. However, as the burning method is risky and causes smoke emissions, it is normally not recommended. It is concluded that for most seed growers, the most effective, least laborious and most environment-friendly alternative to straw removal will be to chop the straw at the back of the combiner during seed harvest.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of sowing rate and row spacing on germination in establishment year and development of generative tillers and seed yield of redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth = A. alba) in the two consecutive production years. Two replicate experiments were performed for 3 years in the same locality in Poland (51°54′N; 17°12′E). The first experiment was established in 2005, with seed production for two successive years (2006 and 2007). The entire experiment was repeated, being established again in 2007 and seed production measured in 2008 and 2009. In both experiments, redtop was sown with row spacings of 24 and 48 cm (factor 1), in sowing of 0.8, 1.6 and 2.4 kg ha−1 (factor 2). The study indicated that at the smallest sowing rate 0.8 kg ha−1 and row spacing 24 cm, field emergence index was the highest (26.3%). The lack of response of the total seed yield from two consecutive production years to sowing rate indicates that in redtop grown for seed, sowing in the amount of 0.8 kg ha−1 is sufficient. Increasing the row spacing from 24 to 48 cm resulted in a reduction in the density of generative tillers in the first and second production years. The row spacing of 48 cm was more favourable for seed yield in the first year, whereas 24 cm in the second year. In view of the increase in the total seed yield from two consecutive production years by 9.5% at the row spacing of 24 cm as compared with 48 cm, the row spacing of 24 cm should be regarded as recommended. Also, higher green matter of autumn regrowth can be obtained at a row spacing of 24 cm than at 48 cm.",

    "abstract": "The leaching of dissolved calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) carbonates is the main cause for decalcination of soils. The efficiency of various limes in replacing the carbonates and stabilising the available Ca content depends on the dynamics of lime solubility. The latter depends on the material and the size of its particles: the finer the material, the sooner it will dissolve and leach. To reduce the leaching of the Ca into the soil and to stabilise the available Ca content, the particle-size distribution on the basis of the solubility of lime particles with different sizes was determined so that lime would dissolve equally in a balanced way during the anticipated time. While the solubility of limestone particles of different sizes was being assessed in distilled water, the pH of water was brought to 4.0 by adding potassium biphthalate C8H5O4K: it was discovered that the solubility dynamics of all the lime applied to the soil can be controlled by means of its particle-size distribution. In the field trial, the soil contained the available Ca after the application of limestone (particle-size distribution: <0.16 mm 7%, <0.5 mm 25%, <2 mm 76% and <4 mm 93%) both at the beginning of the trial and in its third to fourth year at an equal and optimum level for the growth of field crops (1.50 g kg−1, with the base saturation around 80%). Considering the importance of Ca in soil and the leaching of a notable part of it, it is possible, by means of regulating the limestone solubility dynamics by the particle-size distribution, to improve the resistance of limes to leaching and erosion and to stabilise the Ca content in soil.",

In this study, the Century model was used to estimate SOC in volcanic and non volcanic soils of the VIII Region of Chile, and compared with actual SOC of the official Series descriptions. The predicted values were not significantly different from measured SOC of the Entisol, Inceptisol, Mollisol, Alfisol, and Ultisol soil Orders, but were significantly lower for Andisol soils probably because of the presence of additional clay that was not measured in particle size analysis. The respective mean values of Century predicted and actual SOC (g m−2) were 2709 and 3801 for the Entisol soils (11); 5507 and 4940 for Inceptisol soils (24); 4556 and 5263 for Mollisol soils (24); 5015 and 5595 for Alfisol soils (15); 9706 and 6533 for Ultisol soils (6); and 5502 and 9081 for Andisol soils (13). The Century model also underestimated SOC in soils with increasing ratios (>1.2) of 1500 kPa water to measured clay at 50 cm soil depth, an indicator of isotic (volcaniclastic) mineralogy that likewise is associated with additional unmeasured clay in soil. Consequently, in regions with volcanic and non volcanic parent materials across the landscape the ratio can serve as an indicator of soils that have elevated values of SOC relative to the measured clay and subsequently require parameter adjustments, such as using the % calculated clay, for model calibration.",

    "abstract": "Apples are normally produced with focus on the fresh fruit marked, which imply high priority on storability and shelf life. The fruits used for juice are normally those discarded along the post-harvest chain. If the main goal is changed to production of high-quality juice with emphasis on single cultivar characteristic flavours, focus can be on optimal fruit ripening for flavour development. To investigate the juice quality potentials during post-harvest ripening, four apple cultivars: 'Aroma', 'Holsteiner Cox', 'Ingrid Marie' and 'Rajka' were sampled and juiced after 5 and 10 days of post-harvest storage at room temperature (20°C). The soluble solids content (SSC) of 'Ingrid Marie' fruits increased most, and after 10 days, it had the lowest starch content of the four cultivars studied. The mid-to-late season cultivars 'Ingrid Marie', 'Holsteiner Cox' and 'Rajka' had higher SSC/acidity ratio than the middle early season 'Aroma' 'and all of them showed an increase of the ratio SSC/acidity during storage'. The volatile compound measurements (GC-MS) of the juices indicated that particularly 'Holsteiner Cox' and 'Ingrid Marie' have the ability to produce fruity volatile compounds like ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, 2-methylpropyl acetate, butyl acetate, hexyl acetate, hexanal, ethyl propanoate, pentyl acetate and ethyl 2-metylbutanoate exhibiting remarkable changes during ripening. These volatile compounds may explain the post-harvest development of interesting fruity nuances perceived by the sensory panel. The terms 'apricot', 'peach' and 'pineapple' were used to describe the odour and flavour properties of these cultivar juices in the sensory analysis. 'Aroma' apples ranked high on 'citrus', 'red berries' and 'pear' flavour descriptors after 5 days of storage, whereas 'Rajka' showed the weakest aroma profile of the group of cultivars. To exploit the aroma and sensory potential fully, apple cultivars should be further investigated in regards to effects of delayed harvest and different post-harvest treatments.",

Besides its main role in human nutrition, this grain is also used in animal feed and production of biofuels, among other purposes. Due to these factors, soybean became important in the global economy and is the most exported agricultural product from Brazil. Fungal diseases are among the limiting factors on soybean production; sudden death syndrome, caused by Fusarium spp., has been responsible for severe losses on this crop in Brazil. Four species of Fusarium can be considered causal pathogens: F. brasiliense, F. crassistipitatum, F. tucumaniae, and F. virguliforme. The Fusarium spp. isolates characterized in this work were collected in different soybean-producing regions in Brazil. The genetic variability of these isolates was determined through the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Disease severity was evaluated on moderately resistant and susceptible soybean cultivars in greenhouse trials. RAPD analysis demonstrated a great genetic diversity among the isolates and a clear tendency to split into two main species groups, F. tucumaniae and F. brasiliense, both prevalent in Brazil. The disease severity experiments, in which soybean plants were artificially inoculated, have shown that all isolates caused significant damage to the seedling root system. In fact, the genetic diversity of isolates does not correlate with disease severity, and also does not correlate with geographic distribution.",

Three sweet sorghum genotypes (Bailey, Keller and Wray) and five flooding treatments including non-flooding control, continuous flooding extended from 30, 45, 60 and 75 days after emergence to harvest were conducted under greenhouse conditions. Flooding decreased leaf dry weight (22–60%), leaf area (10–70%), number of node per stalk (1–5%), shoot dry weight (5–20%) and stalk yield (2–22%) with highest reduction in 30 days after emergence flooding treatment. Flooding later than 30 days after emergence did not significantly affect shoot growth, yield and yield components. Brix value, sucrose content and total sugar content were not significantly affected. All studied cultivars had similar shoot growth response. Flooding induced development of roots in water; root length, root dry weight, nodal root and lateral root number and interconnection of aerenchyma spaces from roots in flooded soil to stalk base above water level but suppressed root growth in flooded soil. The acclimation traits were highest in Keller, flooding from 30 days after emergence but there was a lack of root development in 75 days after emergence flooding treatments. These findings indicate the effect of waterlogging on sweet sorghum growth and yield strongly depends on the growth stage at which it occurs. There were genetic variations in root morphological and anatomical responses to flooding of sweet sorghum. The development of nodal and lateral roots and aerenchyma formation from flooded plant parts to stalk bases above water level may distribute to flooding tolerance in sweet sorghum. Based on the results, a flood-free period of at least 30 days after emergence is required to sustain yield of pre-rice sweet sorghum and early planting is highly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Efficient non-chemical weed control like flame weeding often requires repeated treatments. In weed control experiments the effect of each treatment may be estimated by removing and weighing the remaining weed biomass after the treatment, but the method influences the weed plants ability to regrow, and therefore it may influence the long-term effect of repeated treatments. Visual assessment of weed cover or image analysis do not affect the remaining parts of the weed plants after treatment, but the methods may have other disadvantages. In order to evaluate and compare three methods we measured changes in vegetation cover of perennial ryegrass after flaming by (1) a simple image analysis programme counting green pixels, (2) visual assessment of images and (3) by taking biomass samples. Plants were flame treated with eight different dosages (0, 20, 30, 35, 45, 60, 90 and 180 kg propane ha−1) and with various treatment frequency (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 yearly treatments). Image analysis and visual assessment of images were easy methods to measure vegetation cover. The experiments showed that increasing dosages and frequent treatments resulted in increasing reduction of plant weight and vegetation cover. However, there were significant differences in the estimated effective doses (e.g., ED50 and ED90 values) depending on assessment method and treatment frequency. One reason could be that image analysis and visual assessment did not affect the remaining weed parts after treatment and therefore gave a more realistic picture of the long-term effect of repeated treatments. Image analysis was most useful for assessing the effect of repeated treatments when weed cover was relatively low (below 40%) and when plots contained relatively much withered plant material. However, when weed cover is close to 100%, dry weight measurements reflected the effect of the treatment better.",

In addition, N-90 plots were sampled on one additional occasion during spring growth and two additional occasions during summer growth. Total fatty acid concentrations and concentrations of the four major fatty acids (C16:0, C18:1n-9, C18:2n-6, and C18:3n-3), which account for 90–94 g 100 g−1 of the total fatty acid contents of both grasses, declined over time during both growth periods in both grass species (p < 0.001), irrespective of N-fertilization level. Moreover, the relative proportions of the four fatty acids were affected by the harvest date (p < 0.001); C16:0, C18:1n-9, and C18:2n-6 increased in abundance at later harvest dates, while the opposite was true for C18:3n-3. There were differences (p < 0.05) between timothy and meadow fescue in terms of the concentrations of C16:0, C18:1n-9, C18:2n-6, and C18:3n-3, and in the relative proportions (p < 0.001) of C16:0, C18:2n-6, and C18:3n-3.

The N-fertilization level did not directly affect (p > 0.05) the concentrations or relative proportions of the different fatty acids, but positive linear relationships (p < 0.001) were identified between the concentrations of fatty acids and crude protein. Consequently, there is a scope for adjusting the fatty acid profile and content of forage by changing the grass species used and the time of harvest, with the latter having the greatest influence.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural soil CO2 emissions and their controlling factors have recently received increased attention because of the high potential of carbon sequestration and their importance in soil fertility. Several parameters of soil structure, chemistry, and microbiology were monitored along with soil CO2 emissions in research conducted in soils derived from a glacial till. The investigation was carried out during the 2012 growing season in Northern Germany. Higher potentials of soil CO2 emissions were found in grassland (20.40 µg g−1 dry weight h−1) compared to arable land (5.59 µg g−1 dry weight h−1) within the incubating temperature from 5°C to 40°C and incubating moisture from 30% to 70% water holding capacity (WHC) of soils taken during the growing season. For agricultural soils regardless of pasture and arable management, we suggested nine key factors that influence changes in soil CO2 emissions including soil temperature, metabolic quotient, bulk density, WHC, percentage of silt, bacterial biomass, pH, soil organic carbon, and hot water soluble carbon (glucose equivalent) based on principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. Slightly different key factors were proposed concerning individual land use types, however, the most important factors for soil CO2 emissions of agricultural soils in Northern Germany were proved to be metabolic quotient and soil temperature. Our results are valuable in providing key influencing factors for soil CO2 emission changes in grassland and arable land with respect to soil respiration, physical status, nutrition supply, and microbe-related parameters.",

Furthermore, lgKf of Cu (II) complexes exhibited a greater linear correlation than the corresponding lgK1 with the nitrification inhibition effects of the corresponding ligands; lgKf of Cu (I) complexes exhibited a steeper linear relationship than that of Cu (II) complexes with NPs or NIRs, and hence, nitrification inhibition effects of Cu (I) ligands almost doubled that of Cu (II) ligands when the lgKf values of Cu (I) and Cu (II) complexes have the same changes.",

    "abstract": "Modern agriculture is causing extensive environmental damage. Arguments have been put forward that a systemic change is needed in agriculture to address the major environmental challenges faced by mankind. This is a case study of a research farm whose aim is to form a farming system that has a minimal impact on carbon and nitrogen cycles while maintaining biodiversity. For the farm to minimise its impact on the global carbon cycle and associated climate change, it is important to reduce fossil energy use. The research farm has minimised all its inputs, but uses a diesel-run tractor. Agriculture's primary function is to provide food of adequate quality. The hypothesis of this study is that using biomass from arable land for tractor work on the farm would reduce the amount of food produced relative to using fossil fuel for tractor work. The objective of this paper was to develop scenarios for biomass-derived tractor work for the study farm chosen and to investigate their impact on food production. Food availability was measured by the number of people the farm could supply, denoted as Np. A farm nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) balance was also applied to the different scenarios. The investigated scenarios for replacing fossil fuel tractor work were draught horsepower combined with cold-pressed rape-seed oil in a tractor, ethanol from wheat produced in a conventional ethanol plant, and farm-made ethanol from potatoes. Using wheat and potato to produce ethanol reduced food production by 23% and 18% respectively, compared to using conventional diesel. Combining a draught horse and on-farm cold-pressed rapeseed oil only reduced the food production by 6%. N is maintained in all scenarios due to the nitrogen-fixing leys. P can be maintained in the fields if bones are recycled, but nutrients, especially K, are moved from meadow to field.",

Anne de Bellevue, Quebec during the growing seasons of 2002 and 2003, to study the effect of Nod factor treatments, applied at specific growth stages, on photosynthesis and biomass accumulation by soybean grown under two tillage systems (conventional tillage, no-tillage). Spray application of Nod factors increased photosynthesis at the four fully expanded trifoliate leaves and full bloom growth stages under no-tillage and conventional tillage; they increased plant biomass at the beginning seed filling stage. Nod factor treatment did not affect yield in 2002, due to severe drought during the reproductive period. In 2003, Nod factor application increased yield under conventional tillage but not under no-tillage, and this may have been due to the negative effect of no-tillage on plant growth on the clay-loam soil at the experimental site. This study indicated that responses to Nod factors are affected by environmental conditions, and that Nod factors may be useful when applied to soybean grown under conventional tillage.",

Forty seeds each, grouped as untreated, leached and leached-scarified (LS) batches, were arranged in a completely randomised design, with five replicates. Seeds in Murashige and Skoog medium were germinated under in vitro conditions for seven weeks at 25°C and 50–60% relative humidity. In both Cucumis species, untreated seeds did not germinate, whereas the LS seeds germinated in both species. In addition to the LS seeds, leached seeds in C. africanus germinated, but completely failed to germinate in C. myriocarpus. In all Cucumis species, seedlings from LS seeds outperformed those from leached seeds, suggesting that both chemical and physical dormancies were involved in seed dormancy and poor performance of seedlings in the two Cucumis species.",

High levels of P fertilization often cause P accumulation in soil and thereby increase P loss to the environment. The effect of long-term P fertilization on soil inorganic P (Pi) fractions and available P (Pa) stocks were investigated in order to provide a reference for rational management of P fertilization. A 27-year experiment was initiated in September 1984 in Changwu County on the southern part of the Loess Plateau, northern China. The experiment included five treatments of P fertilization: 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 kg P ha−1. With zero P application, soil Pi fractions decreased and were even depleted over time. In fertilized plots, soil Pi content in available and unavailable fractions increased over time, regardless of the application rate. P fertilization increased the content and change rate of soil Pi fractions between three sampling times (1991, 2001, and 2011). Soil Pa stocks and plant P uptake increased with increasing application rate of 20–60 kg P ha−1, indicating increased input and output of P in the soil–plant system. Higher application rates (≥60 kg P ha−1) did not change soil Pa stocks or plant P uptake but increased the annual change rate of Pi fractions, maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of P. This study has implications for reducing P fertilization level and decreasing associated environmental risks in agricultural soil on the Loess Plateau.",

(55% and 75%) and temperature (20°C, 25°C and 30°C). Mortality after 7 d increased with the temperature increase and decreased with the increase in r.h. in most of the tested combinations. The mortality of weevils was higher in ORG compared to INT-produced wheat after 7 d. Progeny production was recorded 56 d after removal of parental adults and was higher at 75% r.h. in comparison to 55% r.h. At 55% r.h. and 20°C, progeny was 60.8% higher when S. zeamais were exposed to ORG in comparison to INT-produced wheat. Wheat from different production systems influenced mortality rates which were higher in alternative compared to INT production systems under optimal conditions for wheat storage (low temperature and r.h.). The reverse was recorded for temperature and r.h. increase. Progeny was not affected by wheat from various production systems. Significantly more S. zeamais adults were found in traps containing wheat from BD and control in comparison to INT. An understanding of the agricultural processes, biotic and abiotic factors which alter the post-harvest response of storage pests could be useful for the development of efficient post-harvest strategies for ORG and BD farms and the processing industry.",

    "abstract": "Below-ground (bg) shoot emergence rates of Sonchus arvensis are dependent on temperature and root weight. However, it is unknown to what extent this is due to a root depletion rate that depends on initial root weight, or due to differences in resource allocation to fine root and bg shoot growth. To resolve this, we retrieved data from an experiment in which plants were grown in the dark at constant temperature (4°C, 8°C, and 18°C) and harvested prior to or at shoot emergence. A dynamic mass-balance model, in which biomass of the initial root was allocated to bg shoot and fine root daily growth, and where respiration took place from all tissues, was used. The relative depletion rate of root biomass (RDR; d−1) and fraction of the depleted biomass allocated to bg shoots (SFRR) were estimated and calibrated to observed biomass. The RDR increased with initial root weight and temperature and SFFR was highest for light roots and lowest for heaviest roots, whereas the rest was allocated to fine root biomass. The length-to-biomass ratio of bg shoots decreased with initial root weight. Under between-year weather variations (2004–2010), the reduction in root biomass during the coldest April–May was simulated to be over 12 days delayed compared with the warmest spring. The influence of biomass allocation on bg shoot elongation of heavier roots was thus stimulated by a larger fraction of root biomass being depleted, but counteracted by a smaller fraction of it allocated into bg shoot elongation, compared with lighter roots. The complexity of shoot emergence based on root depletion estimates may be a reason why predictions based on only an accumulated root weight-specific temperature sum, as proposed by a previous study, are expected to be less uncertain than those based on root depletion estimates.",

Thus, the study aimed to assess the effect of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) application in different doses to P. brachyurus control in maize. Initially, 1000 specimens of P. brachyurus were inoculated in maize for the multiplication. After 60 days, the aerial part (AP) was discarded and maize was sown under the treatments: seed treatment (ST), application in the AP and ST + AP, in the doses of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 g i.a./L. Vegetative and nematological parameters were assessed 60 days later. ASM did not affect plant growth, but reduced nematode population in all the treatments. The treatment methods did not differ and reduced the number of nematodes/g root by 64.25 to 80.14% compared to the control. The doses of 0.6, 0.51 and 0.65 g i.a./L promoted the most reductions in the number of nematodes/g root when applied in ST, AP and ST + AP, respectively. Thus, we recommend the use of ASM applied on shoot in a dose of 0.50 g i.a./L.",

Seventy days after initiating the treatments, the interactions were not significant (P ≥ .05) on all variables, but the main factors were highly significant. Regression of nematode population densities, root gall and dry shoot mass over increasing phytonematicide concentration exhibited quadratic relations, which were explained by 93%, 97% and 99%, respectively. In contrast, stem diameter and phytonematicide concentration had a positive linear relation, which was explained by 98%. Nematode numbers over increasing EM concentration exhibited quadratic relation, which was explained by 97%. All plant variables and EM had no significant relations. In conclusion, the efficacy of NAG phytonematicide on nematode suppression and plant growth was independent of EM activities, suggesting that irrigation water played a major role in the efficacy of the product in granular formulation.",

Significant decreases in living seedling rates and total yields with time were exhibited in the 100% NPK treatments, showing an obvious obstacles event, which can be mitigated by reducing fertilizer use. It was found that both total yields and living seedling rates were negatively correlated with the proportion of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (a known cucumber wilt pathogen) in F. oxysporum, suggesting the two fungal groups out of balance in the rhizosphere, was the key factor for the decline in cucumber growth in the monocropping system. Furthermore, the abundance of pseudomonas group, not hydrogen cyanide- or phenazine-producing pseudomonas, can act as the defender against possible fungal pathogens. The opposite relationships between HCN-producing pseudomonas and two plant indicators (cucumber yield and living seedling rate) suggested that HCN-producing pseudomonas exerted positive effects only when cucumber plants' density was above a certain threshold. The Redundancy Analysis (RDA) showed that changes in soil microbial population size, especially in pseudomonas groups, contributed to the mitigation process.",

The stability was analysed by using some of the most common stability parameters. The other objective was to study the influence of variation between locations and years on the yield stability of barley under growing conditions in Finland. Barley breeder's trials of the Agricultural Research Centre of Finland from the years 1987-89 were used as material in this study. In each of these years six trials from different parts of Finland and six genotypes were analysed. Four parameters were used in analysis of yield stability: b i (Finlay & Wilkinson, 1963), s 2 d i (Eberhart & Russell, 1966), r 2 i (Pinthus, 1973) and environmental variance s 2 i. Each parameter was calculated from single- and multi-year results. The multi-year results were considered as reliable data with which to estimate yield stability. The reliability of the stability parameters was tested by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between single- and multi-year stability values of each parameter. Although the variation between years was highly significant, there was no interaction between genotypes and years. In two experimental years genotype × location interaction was highly significant, and on the basis of this study, the genotype × location interaction seems to be a more important factor than genotype × year interaction in barley breeding for Finnish conditions. However, a series of three years may not be sufficient for indicating genotypes × years interactions. In this study two stability parameters, b i and s 2 i, gave a reliable estimate of yield stability on the basis of single-year trials.",

On the coarse sandy soil the autumn-applied slurry caused a strongly increased N-leaching, while the undersown catch crop reduced the leaching. The unfertilized soil differed from the fertilized treatments with a lower N-uptake and a decreased N-leaching, especially on the sandy loam soil. The type of fertilization did not influence the net N-mineralization very much. The N-balances were based on the store of mineral nitrogen in spring and at harvest, as well on the N-input and N-output, which included N fertilization, net N mineralization, and N-uptake, N-leaching and N-denitrification. The deviations in N-balance were strongly influenced by the high variations found for the N-pools included in the N-balance and only to a minor extent by the climatic conditions and the type of soil.",

The daily CER varied considerably from day to day owing to the large variation in solar radiation. Light saturation of CER seemed not to be reached even on clear days, and a light dose (PAP = number of photosynthetic active photons) produced by variable light over one week in summer gave the same total CER as a similar PAP produced by a constant PPFD. CER at constant PPFD increased rapidly during the first two hours of the photoperiod, followed by a slight increase during the subsequent hours, before CER slightly decreased towards the end of the photoperiod. Raising the CO2 concentration significantly increased CER during the entire photoperiod, and by 32% as a mean for the whole photoperiod. Elevated CO2 decreased the night respiration of the plants by 30%. As a total of the light and dark period, CO2 enrichment increased CER by 38%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nitrogen (N) deficiency has become more common in the traditional wheat cultivation areas of southern Finland as yield potentials have increased. Based on data for the period studied (1968-88) a grain protein concentration below 11.2% in spring wheat (Triticun aestivum L.) is an indicator of N deficiency. The mean of maximum grain yield obtained was 4655 kg ha−1 when grain protein concentration exceeded 11.2%. The estimation of plant tissue N content could be an effective diagnostic tool for identifying N status in the early growth stages of spring wheat. To address the feasibility of this test, the present study was conducted in 1990-91 to determine the critical plant tissue N concentrations of three plant parts at the early double-ridge stage (Stage 2), at the stage when stigmatic branches of the carpel begin to form (Stage 7) and at pollination (Stage 10). Nitrogen was applied at rates of 0 and 110 kg N ha−1 as granular ammonium nitrate and granular slow-release-nitrogen fertilizers to establish a wide range of plant tissue N levels, grain yields and grain protein concentrations. Critical plant N levels were calculated for the different plant parts using the Cate-Nelson procedure. From this study it can be concluded that the critical N level recommended for Stage 2 is 43 g of N kg−1 dry matter of the whole plant. Critical N levels recommended for Stage 7 are 28 g of N kg−1 dry matter of the whole plant, 30 g of N kg−1 of the leaves and 13 mg total N in dry matter. Critical N levels recommended for Stage 10 are 12 g of N kg−1 of the whole plant, 23 g of N kg−1 of the leaves and 15 mg total N in dry matter.

Data on vegetative and reproductive growth were recorded. A small additional experiment to verify the effects of light on development was performed in frames at Alnarp. The results suggest that the genotype of wild lingonberry accessions controls their spreading ability (i.e. number of rhizomes), influences its growth, thereby affecting plant height, and determines the number of vegetative shoots, total number of shoots and berry set. Furthermore, light influences plant height, vegetative shoots and number of fertile shoots. The propagule system affects the number of both vegetative and fertile shoots.

The study was carried out during the period 3 May to 5 August in ten field chamber units of 9 m2 in a cool (12.6°C) maritime climate under long days (15.8–18.1 h day‐1) on the south‐west coast of Norway (59° N, 6° E).

After 10 days, the soils were extracted and washed with K2SO4 and determined for total N and atom% 15N excess.

Dark germination was inferior to germination in light/ dark cycles at constant temperatures of 15°C and higher, but light showed no advantage at alternating temperature. Continuous light inhibited germination regardless of light source (fluorescent, incandescent or natural).

Oat plants ( Avena sativa L. cv. Montezuma) grew in a nutrient solution-irrigated sand culture. Seed number (sink size) was related to grain N-RAR. The P- and Mg-RAR differed from the N-RAR by having proportionally higher initial and final rates, together with lower middle period rates. N harvest index (grain N content/total plant N content) and N utilization efficiency (grain weight/total plant N content) were linearly related to the grain NRAR and also linearly inversely related to the grain RGR. Using grain RGR and RAR with NHI and NUE, it appears possible to optimize mineral utilization for grain nutrient quality maximization relative to yield.",

The NPK and NPK plus glucose treatments resulted in significantly reducing soil acidification and NO3 − accumulation compared with the N-only fertilization. The terminal restriction fragment size measuring 283 (Nitrosospira) and 54 bp (unidentified) were predominant in the soil ammonia-oxidizing bacterial composition for all treatments. The N-only fertilization did not change the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community, the bacterial community composition based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and the bacterial functional diversity based on Biolog EcoPlateTM incubation. The NPK and NPK plus glucose treatments resulted in a shift in the soil ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community and bacterial community composition, and significantly increased the bacterial functional diversity (average well colour development, Richness and Shannon index). Nitrosomonas species were detected in the soil upon NPK and NPK plus glucose treatment on incubation day 9 but not on days 1 and 31. The effect of NPK treatment on the bacterial community composition was transient; a new 116 bp fragment was present on incubation day 9, but the data returned to their original values by day 31. In contrast, treatment with NPK plus glucose resulted in the appearance of a new 116 bp fragment that remained until incubation day 31. These results demonstrated that the balanced fertilization of N, P, K and glucose, plays an important role in regulating ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community quickly, and promoting nitrification functions. The results also showed the importance of balanced fertilization in reducing acidification, improving bacterial community structure and function in latosolic red soil. Therefore, optimizing the ammonia oxidation process by balanced fertilization may be helpful to reduce the loss of soil nitrogen.",

Besides the two red clover-based treatments, two treatments, one unamended and the other Biofer, an organic fertilizer with 7% S containing by-products from the slaughter industry, were included in the experiments. The availability of S in relation to N was higher in biogas slurry than in fresh red clover. In the incubation, an equal percentage (approx. 50%) of N was mineralized from all three fertilizers, while in the pot experiment, N mineralization was highest in the red clover treatment (approximately 70%). The highest S mineralization in both experiments occurred in the Biofer treatment. Growth of white cabbage was higher in the biogas slurry than in the red clover treatment despite high N availability in the latter treatment. Immobilization of S due to more readily available C in the clover treatment could have reinforced the difference and given a less well adjusted relationship between N and S for white cabbage demand than in the biogas slurry treatment. Arylsulphatase activity in the bulk soil was higher in the red clover-based treatments than with Biofer, while the activity in the rhizosphere soil did not differ between treatments. Arylsulphatase activity in the bulk soil was negatively correlated with white cabbage S concentration and positively correlated with N:S ratio in white cabbage shoots, while that in the rhizosphere soil was positively correlated with white cabbage S concentration.",

The coefficient of determination (R 2) for the predicted soil salinity is 0.867. The predicted salinity of the topsoil is higher than that in the deep soil, although both salinity distributions show a similar trend.

    "abstract": "Abstract Turf grasses entering the Nordic winter must be healthy and have sufficient reserves. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of autumn mowing height and late autumn fertilization (LAF) on golf greens. Eighteen experiments were carried out on golf courses in Finland (3), Sweden (3) and Norway (7), nine in 2008/2010 and nine in 2009/2010. Starting in late August or early September, the greens were cut for about one month at 100% or 150% of the height practiced during summer. Within each mowing height, 2 g N/m2 was applied in a complete, mineral fertilizer when the turf had stopped growing. Unfertilized control plots were established using tarpaulin covers, three within each mowing height. The grass species were creeping bent grass (Agrostis stolonifera L.: 6 expt.), red fescue (Festuca rubra: 4 expt.), velvet bent grass (Agrostis canina: 3 expt.), and annual meadow grass (Poa annua: 5 expt). Overall winter damage, turf coverage and overall turf impression were assessed in spring. The results showed different responses among species: (1) Red fescue-dominated greens had significantly better turf grass coverage and overall impression after LAF. Higher mowing tended to improve spring performance. (2) LAF improved coverage and overall impression, but did not reduce winter damage or winter diseases on creeping bent grass greens. There was no effect of mowing height. (3) Velvet bent grass greens showed no significant effect of either mowing height or LAF. On annual meadow grass greens higher mowing improved spring performance more than LAF. Since there were no negative effects of LAF, we conclude that LAF is beneficial for golf greens under Nordic conditions. The effect of higher mowing in autumn differed among species, but can be recommended for annual meadow grass and red fescue. Further research is needed to find optimal time and fertilizer rate.",

In one Norwegian zone, however, a single variety was superior and it could not be included among the high yielding varieties that do not interact with locations. Zones in different countries were compared by tests for equality of variety effects. Although the number of varieties common to the trials in neighbouring countries was rather limited, the Nordic countries were, on the basis of similarity of results and geographic considerations, divided into five internordic zones. There were deviations within zones, however, which may indicate that an alternative or more detailed zoning could be more appropriate, but the resulting zones may also reflect the collection of varieties that happened to be tested in the available experiments. Available experimental results are probably more useful for testing the validity of zones established by other criteria, such as meteorological parameters, than for defining zones.

Therefore, the present study focuses on the evaluation of the phenotypic stability of some important quality characteristics of barley, oats and spring wheat cultivars on the basis of 41, 38 and 21 field experiments, respectively. Field trials were carried out at the Experimental Farms of Hankkija Plant Breeding Institute (Anttila and Nikkilä) over seven successive years (1982–88). The stability of the quality characteristics was examined using the Finlay-Wilkinson regression method and the Eberhart-Russell stability analysis, both widely used in evaluations of yield stability. In the present study genotype × environment (G × E) interaction was insignificant in the protein concentration of barley; 1000 grain weight, hectolitre weight, protein yield and husk content of oats; as well as hectolitre weight, Zeleny sedimentation volume, and falling number of wheat. Therefore, for these particular quality traits, the cultivars included in this study responded in a similar fashion to varying growing conditions. In contrast, 1000 grain weight, hectolitre weight and protein yield of barley, protein concentration of oats, and 1000 grain weight, protein concentration and protein yield of wheat indicated a significant G × E interaction. Phenotypic stability of these latter quality traits in different spring cereal cultivars is compared and discussed in more detail.",

Differences between the treatments were only apparent in the early crop of lettuce. With the early crop, the dry matter content of the leguminous green manure was more significant in effect on yield than its nutrient content. Red clover and lucerne provided approximately the same level of nutrients as yellow sweet clover, but despite this gave lower yields of Iceberg lettuce than the yellow sweet clover. A possible reason for this was that the higher amount of dry matter supplied by the yellow sweet clover had a positive effect on soil structure and thus improved lettuce rooting and water uptake. The results indicate that at farm level, reliability of biomass production is more important in choice of a green manure crop than chemical and morphological properties of the species.",

The challenge is to find ways and means to meet the current consumer concerns, and to restore public and market confidence in the authorization procedure for GMOs. In order to upgrade the legislative framework, a new Directive has been adopted in 2001, establishing that GMOs cannot be released into the environment without a prior assessment of any potential risks to human health or the environment and without explicit approval from the authorities. The Directive has been complemented by draft legislation on traceability and labelling of GM products, which are currently debated in the Council and in the Parliament. However, a new, more stringent, regulatory framework might not be sufficient to restore public confidence in terms of the purchase and consumption of genetically modified food products. It will be necessary for all stakeholders, Member States, the European institutions, industry and research as well as NGOs and the media, to reflect upon their responsibilities and provide a balanced response to public concerns.",

A total of 1200 seedlings treated with Polystimulin-A6 at four different concentrations, and a total of 300 control seedlings, were investigated taking account of height, collar diameter, dry weight, number and size of leaves. The greatest height and collar diameter were found with the treatment Polystimulin-A6 at 200 mg/l. In contrast, the control treatment resulted in the least height and collar diameter. The greatest seedling height measured 52.77 cm at the 200 mg/l level, compared with 38.37 cm for the control seedlings. The greatest root collar diameter measured 16.44 mm with the transplanted seedlings, while the least measured 7.01 mm. with the control seedlings. Also, seedling dry weight, root percentage, number and size of leaves were higher than the control. To conclude, it is obvious that Polystimulin-A6 is very effective and has contributed significantly to the metabolism of Fagus orientalis L. seedlings. According to this study, the application of Polystimulin-A6 to beech seedlings has been recommended for practical use in nursery situations.",

Various classes of compound have been suggested although most have one or more disadvantages compared with Bt toxins. A pool of alternative ICPs would allow pyramiding of resistance genes, which should have a number of advantages: multifactorial resistance is expected to be more durable, to increase the spectrum of pests targeted and to be more effective. Some of these compounds address concerns about durability, spectrum of activity, reliability, environmental impact and public acceptability of GM crops.

A.tenuis Sibth.) field trials comparing sowing rates of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 or 10 kg ha−1 were conducted at Landvik, south-east Norway, (58°N) from 1989 to 1994. Three trials were laid out of the forage cultivar ‘Leikvin’ and three trials of the lawn cultivar ‘Nor’, each trial being harvested for three consecutive years. While the average per cent ground cover in spring increased from 87% at 2.5 kg ha−1 to 94–96% at 7.5 kg ha−1, seed yields decreased with increasing sowing rate in both cultivars. On average for all harvests, quadrupling the sowing rate from 2.5 to 10 kg ha−1 reduced seed yield by 9% in ‘Leikvin’ and 15% in ‘Nor’, the stronger effect probably being associated with a greater competition between tillers in the lawn cultivar. Seed yield reductions with increasing sowing rate showed no relationship with crop age, but were less accentuated for crops undersown in spring wheat in a dry year than for crops established without cover crop in years with ample rainfall in early summer. Increasing sowing rates reduced plant height and panicle number in ‘Nor’, but had no effect on seed weight or germination in any of the cultivars. It is concluded that seed crops of common bent should be established with a sowing rate of 2–5 kg ha−1, with the lowest rate in lawn cultivars, under ideal seedbed conditions and when seed crops are sown without cover crop.",

There is still lack of high-resistant cucumber cultivars against this pathogen, and the use of fungicides is threatening the environmental conditions. However, biocontrol is an environment-friendly technique in plant protection. In this regard, the present work was aimed to screen antagonistic bacterial strains from vermicompost to against FOC in cucumber. Using the dilution-plate method, 374 bacterial strains were isolated from fresh vermicompost. A total of 28 bacterial strains showed antagonistic activity against FOC, among which strain D2 exhibited the best inhibitory effect on the growth of FOC, with the diameter of the growth inhibition zone of 28.28 mm. Then strain D2 was classified and identified based on the morphology and colony characteristics, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence homology. For molecular identification, a 1,462-bp fragment of 16S rDNA of strain D2 was obtained. Based on its morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, strain D2 was identified as Burkholderia cenocepacia.",

This study was conducted to investigate beetle community response to six years of tillage, crop residue application, crop rotation and soil fertility amendments (low fertiliser, high fertiliser, manure, manure + low fertiliser and manure + 60 kg N ha−1) treatments. Reduced tillage increased beetle abundance by 4.6% relative to soil inversion tillage. Crop residue application increased the abundances of Platynus assimilis, Zophosis boei and total beetles by two to three times. Meanwhile, Renatiella reticulata increased by 628.6% in high fertiliser compared to manure + 60 kg N ha−1, manure + low fertiliser and the control. In crop rotation + crop residue retention plots, application of sole manure at 10 t ha−1 increased the Shannon index by 360–365% relative to manure + 60 kg N ha−1 and manure + low fertiliser. Based on the findings in this study, it can be concluded that reduced tillage, retention of crop residues on the soil surface and application of manure increase surface-dwelling beetle abundance and diversity.",

Demand for locally produced food and feed is also increasing, making it interesting to explore the potential for soybean production in high-latitude regions. Scope. To present information on the potential for cultivating vegetable soybean, edamame, under cold-temperate conditions. Conclusions. For the successful establishment, sowing at low soil temperatures should be avoided. Commercial inoculants are effective, irrespective of soybean cultivar. There is no need to re-inoculate fields if the crop has been included in the crop rotation. Little nitrogen remains in the soil after harvest, resulting in a low risk of leaching but a need for nitrogen fertilisation of the following crop. Suitable vegetable soybean cultivars are available on the market and are preferred compared to cultivars intended for dry harvest. The cropping system needs to be improved, e.g. by moderating the microclimate by plastic tunnels, in order to secure harvest.",

In the present study, the severity of powdery mildew was evaluated on spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and five alternative oilseed crop species (B. juncea, B. nigra, Sinapis alba, Raphanus sativus, Eruca sativa). The main aim of the study was to identify plant species that are less susceptible to powdery mildew for possible application as cover crop, in trap cropping or seed production. Powdery mildew assessments were conducted in two growing seasons that were characterised by unusually warm and dry conditions for northern temperate climatic conditions. In both growing seasons, a heavy powdery mildew infection (over 80%) was recorded on B. napus and B. nigra plants, indicating that E. cruciferarum is an important pathogen for oilseed crops in northern Baltics. However, three other cruciferous species S. alba, E. sativa and R. sativus showed full resistance to powdery mildew, and thus, even under strong powdery mildew pressure, they can be cultivated without pesticide application in northern Baltic conditions. We suggest that in changing climatic conditions powdery mildew is expected to become a more serious problem in cruciferous oilseed crops in northern Europe, especially under intensive short-rotation farming practices.",

However, the inhibitory effect on nitrification and the abundance of ammonia oxidisers in different soil types remain unclear. Two temperate paddy soils with different organic matter contents were collected to investigate the impact on nitrification rates of two rice cultivar root exudates, El Paso 144 (O. sativa ssp. indica) and Tacuarí (O. sativa spp. japonica). Root exudates were extracted before the tillering growth stage, and their BNI potential was evaluated in a bioassay with luminescent Nitrosomonas europaea and in a 12-day soil microcosm incubation. While exudates from Tacuarí showed stronger BNI activity in the bioassay, its nitrification inhibition in both soils was similar to that of DCD. El Paso did not show BNI activity in Salto whose organic matter content was higher. The abundance of ammonia oxidisers was not affected by root exudates or DCD, but only ammonia-oxidising bacteria had a significant positive relationship with soil nitrate. Our results demonstrated that although the bioassay showed high BNI activity, its expression in soils varied depending on the rice cultivar and the type of soil, particularly with its organic matter content.",

Based on the laboratory evaluation, sweet lupine forage and seed can be used as homegrown protein source in livestock feeding. Farmers preferred all the tested lupine genotypes for their after assessing its grain yield. Even though Sanabor (Accession No. 144) was inferior in its grain yield, the farmers preferred the Sanabor mainly due to their early maturity, short growth habit, lodging tolerance, despite its high vegetative growth. Thus, the consideration of farmers’ preference for forage crops is crucial for increased adoption of improved forage crops.",

P. chlamydosporia was used alone or in combination with two botanicals for controlling Meloidogyne incognita in chickpea. The laboratory assessment was performed with four prepared concentrations (S, S/2, S/10, S/25) of fungal inoculum of P. chlamydosporia against egg hatching and second-stage juvenile's mortality of M. incognita. All four concentrations reduced egg hatching and increased mortality of J2s. In pot experiment, P. chlamydosporia was used with chopped leaves of two botanicals viz., Ageratum conyzoides and Eichhornia crassipes against M. incognita in chickpea. All the treatments found significantly suppressed root infestation caused by M. incognita and improved growth and physiological attributes of chickpea. The combined application of P. chlamydosporia + A. conyzoides was found highly effective, and E. crassipes alone was least.

Therefore, 14 cover crops were investigated for their interaction with sclerotia, topsoil moisture and temperature in two consecutive field trials in East Austria. In July, after the cover crops were sown, sclerotia were inoculated at 3 cm soil depth in two mesh tubes per plot with 1×1 mm and 3×10 mm mesh size and remained until March. Cover crops did not affect decay of sclerotia, but sclerotia declined faster in 3×10 mm mesh compared to 1×1 mm (75.7 and 54.7%; respectively). Degree days reached the required 500 °C for apothecia development in September in both years, but only in year 1 was topsoil moisture sufficient for apothecia development. Nonmetric dimensional scaling revealed that, among others, topsoil temperature in March was significant for sclerotia germination in spring and was independent of plant biomass. There are indications that Poaceae such as sorghum × Sudan grass and Sudan grass can stimulate early germination under cover crops, causing vulnerability of sclerotia to degradation. This could reduce the pathogen pressure for the subsequent irrigated cash crops.",

Time to flowering was decreased by long days in all six varieties when these were not subject to vernalization. The combined treatment of both vernalization and long days always resulted in the shortest time to flowering. The effect of daylength was most pronounced in the thermosensitive varieties. In the nonvernalized thermoneutral varieties time to flowering was reduced by 10 to 21 days. There was no flowering in the thermosensitive varieties without vernalization during the 132 days of the experiment. A reduced number of main-stem leaves in nonvernalized treatments in 24-h compared with 10-h days indicates that part of the hastening of flowering in long days was caused by a photoperiod-sensitive flower initiation, and not only caused by increased growth rate. A juvenile, photoperiod-insensitive pre-inductive phase was further established in another experiment where plants were transferred from short (11 h) to long day (18 h) and vice versa at set times. The results showed a well defined juvenile phase of about 35 days where the photoperiod had no effect. After this phase a clear daylength effect was evident both when expressed as time to flowering and as number of main stem leaves developed before flower initiation. Time to flowering was reduced from about 144 days to 65 days and the number of main-stem leaves from 78 to 45. Only a few diurnal cycles in the inductive phase were necessary to reach full photoperiod response.",

After four weeks in culture, there was a reduction in both the rooting percentage and root length of sour orange explants. When riboflavin was added to the nutrient medium containing 0.1 mg dm−3 α-naphthaleneacetic acid, the rooting percentage of sour orange explants was reduced. However, in the treatments containing 1.0 mg dm−3 α-naphthaleneacetic acid the root length increased. Rooting in trifoliate orange explants was not distinctly affected by riboflavin. Increasing riboflavin concentration in the nutrient medium leads to a) the rooting percentage was affected (reduced) only in sour orange explants treated with 0.1 mg dm−3 NAA; b) the root length either decreased (0.1 mg dm−3 NAA) or increased (1.0 mg dm−3 NAA); and c) the root number was reduced in most treatments. Finally, it is strongly recommended that riboflavin in vitro should be extensively studied, as it has immense economic significance for commercial laboratories when it is added to the nutrient medium with the aim to reduce exogenous auxin levels, rather than transferring cultures to a growth-regulator-free medium.",

Results indicated that seed yield in M150 was significantly lower than in F150 in both years. Seed protein content in the inorganic fertilization system (F150) was significantly higher than in the organic (M150) and integrated systems (F100M50 and F50M100). Seed oil content, however, was higher in the organic treatment than in the inorganic treatment. Less N uptake in F100M50 compared with F150 in the first year and in F50M100 compared with F150 in the second year did not result in similar differences in grain yield. Owing to the low content of soil-available Zn, the association between Zn and N concentration in shoot in the inorganic treatments was low. In spite of a significant increase in soil-available Zn under the organic and integrated treatments, no significant increase was observed in Zn concentration of shoot in these treatments compared with F150. It appears that the excessive availability of P in M150, F50M100, and F100M50 has reduced either Zn uptake or its translocation from root to shoot. Overall, it could be concluded that in order to increase Zn uptake under manure application in a Zn-deficient soil, N availability should increase.",

To approximate the dependence of θ on ε r , a logarithmic equation was chosen. Satisfactory results were obtained on stone-free areas, with the mean relative variance between θ-values determined by dielectric constant and converted from a gravimetric method remaining within the limits of measuring error. However, variances were higher for stony soils, with ε r -values at the same θ being considerably higher. To reconcile data from stony and stone-free soils, a formula was composed. Salinity, calculated by a semi-empirical model based on Hilhorst's theory using measured values of EC a, ε r , and soil temperature, correlated well with contents of K and Mg in the soil. A lower correlation resulted for P, and was practically absent for Ca. Inequality of these regression equations at different measuring sites demonstrates the necessity of considering soil pH when assessing plant nutrients in the soil.",

    "abstract": "Repeated measurements of a response variable in crops or plants receiving different treatments are widely used in agricultural science. In this paper we analyse repeated measurements of the concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates in stem and ear of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) receiving different doses of growth regulators at different times. The objectives were to examine and compare three covariance structures and illustrate their effect on significance levels, the estimates, and standard error of estimates. The three covariance structures tested were unstructured, compound symmetry, and first-order antedependence. The Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion were used to find the best covariance structure. The choice of covariance structure had an effect on the significance levels for the stem data, whereas no effect was observed for the ear data. The estimates of the water-soluble carbohydrates concentrations within the stem and ear datasets were similar for all three covariance structures, while the smallest standard errors were obtained using the compound symmetry covariance structure. As it was the goal to do parsimonious modelling more weight was given to the Bayesian information criteria than to the Akaike information criteria. Accordingly, the compound symmetry structure was chosen for the stem data and the unstructured structure was found to be the best structure for the ear data. A model check of the residuals showed that there was no pattern in the residuals.",

In this study, the performance of six strawberry cultivars was studied in a table-top system using peat bags as substrate inside or outside an open polythene tunnel. The table-top system resulted in high-quality fruit production, with easy-to-pick fruit and a high percentage of marketable produce. The tunnel reduced average solar radiation and increased temperature slightly and simultaneously protected the plants from rain, this did reduce yield or fruit quality parameters compared with uncovered plots. Partly because of an increased incidence of powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca macularis) inside the tunnel, fruit brightness was reduced in the second harvest year. Of the cultivars included, ‘Elsanta’, ‘Sonata’ and ‘Alice’ may be considered well adapted to the system, whereas ‘Honeoye’, ‘Florence’ and ‘Babette’ are inferior.",

Non-fertilized strips that were ploughed and either unsown or sown with a grass and meadow herb seed mixture were created in a grass crop field, in order to test the establishment of several meadow herb species, to investigate to what extent creation of sown and unsown strips increased plant species numbers and the number of meadow herbs, and to assess the contribution of species dispersal from an adjacent semi-natural field margin into the created strips. The strips were cut each autumn and plant material removed. Plant species composition was studied in permanent quadrats in the strips and in the surrounding grass crop during four years. Four of the 22 sown meadow herb species did not establish in the strips. Sowing increased both the number of meadow herbs and plant species diversity (calculated by the Shannon index) compared with the grass crop. Creating unsown strips did not increase the number of meadow herbs or plant species diversity. The created strips were colonized by woody species originating from the adjacent semi-natural field margin, but the meadow herbs present in the field margin did not colonize the strips. In the short term, establishment of sown strips would improve biodiversity locally. However, such strips will not serve as suitable habitats for the most vulnerable meadow herbs, and thus creation of new strips cannot compensate for loss of existing species-rich, semi-natural habitats.",

Seven field trials were conducted in Southeast Norway from 2000 to 2003. Barley was seeded at 360 and 240 seeds m−2 and wheat at 525 and 350 seeds m−2. White clover was seeded perpendicularly to the cover crop at 400 seeds m−2/13 cm row distance or 200 seeds m−2/26 cm. Results showed that light penetration in spring and early summer was better in wheat than in barley. On average for seven trials, this resulted in 11% higher seed yield after establishment in wheat than in barley. The 33% reduction in cover crop seeding rate had no effect on white clover seed yield for any of the cover crops. Reducing the seeding rate/doubling the row distance of white clover had no effect on seed yield but resulted in slightly earlier maturation of the seed crop.",

This was assessed for a fertilised sandy loam site in central Sweden cultivated with spring barley for a four year period using a process based crop and soil simulation model (SOILN) calibrated to fit observations of field experiments with non-modified crops. Crop properties were changed in accordance with previous model applications to other crops with higher N uptake and utilisation efficiencies, to resemble potential effects of breeding. For the modified crops a doubling of daily uptake efficiency of soil mineral N and/or increase of radiation use efficiency by 30%, increased plant biomass by 3%–30%, decreased N leaching by 1%–30% and increased soil organic carbon (SOC) content by 1–12 g C m−2 year−1. The larger changes were mainly due to increased uptake efficiency. Fertilisation of the modified spring barley crop could be reduced while still producing the same plant biomass as the non-modified crop. The plant biomass to N leaching ratio of the modified crops increased. The simulated changes in plant biomass and SOC were sensitive to weather conditions suggesting that in situ experiments would need to cover a large range of weather conditions to evaluate the performance of new crop traits under climatic variability. The study suggests a strong need that field experiments are accompanied with model applications, when exploring the potential of the modified crops under variable conditions.",

Organic tomato fruits produced by three organic nutrient solutions, which consisted of different mixtures of several OMRI certified nitrogen fertilizers and one inorganic nutrient solution (Steiner’s solution) as the control, were evaluated for their polyphenol and carotenoid content. We used Tomato Analyzer (TA) to evaluate fruit size and shape. Moreover, we implemented a digital image analysis tool, Color Test (CT), as part of the TA software application to collect and analyse fruit colour parameters. The application of organic fertilizers positively affected the total hydrolysable and condensed polyphenols of tomato fruits compared to the control. The high air temperature (>30°C) and sub-optimal light intensity negatively affected the carotene content of tomato fruits, as well as their morphological and colour attributes. Plants fed with organic solutions containing ASA + ASB + NK2SO4 showed comparable morphology and fruit colour attributes to those of the control plants that received Steiner’s nutrient solution. The results indicated that the application of organic fertilizers positively affected the total hydrolysable and condensed polyphenols of tomato fruits compared to the control. Plants fed with the Steiner’s nutrient solution exhibited the highest carotenoid content in tomato fruits. Organically produced tomatoes through animal-based fertilizer application displayed similar fruit morphology and colour attributes compared to conventionally produced tomatoes.",

In this present work, the average nitrogen uptake by silage corn increased significantly by 11.6% in cover plots compared with the no-cover control plots. The recovery efficiency and agronomic efficiency of applied nitrogen in silage corn declined in cover plots compared to no-cover plots. The average soil water storage in cover plots was significantly higher than in the control after corn sowing and at the harvest stage. With increasing nitrogen application level, the average corn grain yield increased significantly at 56 and 112 kg N ha−1 by 13.1% and 39.8%, respectively. Planting a forage radish cover crop can facilitate growth of silage corn and markedly improve total nitrogen uptake of corn.

This study was conducted to determine the effect of previously applied fertilizer N and previously applied lime rates on groundnut yield, 15N concentration, total N uptake and N2 fixation. Previously applied N rates were 0, 80, 160 and 240 kg N ha‐1 as NH4NO3 to main plots or labelled‐N rates of 0, 40, 80 and 120 kg NO3‐N ha‐1 to microplots as NH4 I5NO3. The lime was previously applied at the rates of 0 and 2 Mg ha‐1 to the preceding maize (Zea mays L.) crop. The effect of inoculum was also investigated. Nodulating isoline, groundnut cv Chalimbana seed was treated with Bradyrhizobium peat inoculum containing Bradyrhizobium sp. (inoculant strain TAL 1000) 105 cells per seed. Non‐nodulating isoline PI 109839/NC AC17090 (NFN‐43) and nodulating isoline Chalimbana were grown in the field during the 1989/90 cropping season on a Misamfu red sandy loam soil at Kasama, Zambia. Whole‐plant dry matter production or kernel yield and total N uptake of non‐nodulating plants were lower than those of the nodulating plants. Total N uptake by whole‐plant dry matter in all plants was higher in a treatment previously supplemented with 160 kg N ha‐1 than in 80 kg N ha‐1. Residual lime increased kernel yield and N2 fixation in nodulating plants. The amounts of fertilizer 15N uptake by plants increased with labelled previously applied fertilizer N rates. The higher recovery of previously applied labelled N fertilizer in nodulated than in non‐nodulated plants was due to differences in dry matter production. Previously applied higher N fertilization rates (greater than 160 kg N ha‐1) with previously applied lime reduced N2 fixation. Lime enhanced N2fixation by the isotope dilution (ID) method. Groundnut inoculation seems to be a viable technology, since it increases in plant dry matter production and grain yield.",

Aggregates were collected from the 0-12 cm and 12-24 cm depth layers. The respiration rates of the aggregates were measured in the laboratory using conductimetric respirometers. Respiration rates were measured with zero mechanical energy input and with mechanical energy inputs typical of those induced by tillage. Shallow (ploughless) tillage resulted in higher organic carbon (Corg) content in the surface layer and lower Corg content in the deeper layer than the ploughed treatment. Basal respiration rates were positively correlated with the Corg contents of the aggregates. It is concluded that some of the Corg is ?physically protected? against microbial activity and it is hypothesized that soils with higher clay content have the potential to retain higher contents of physically protected Corg. There was no effect of straw-management treatment on either Corg or respiration rate. Similarly, there was no statistically significant effect on respiration rate of mechanical energies typical of those used in tillage. However, the application of energies higher than those used in tillage resulted in increased respiration rates. This leads to the hypothesis of energy thresholds for the removal of physical protection from soil Corg.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine how nitrogen (N) application patterns affect yield, forage quality and crop N removal in a two-cut system in grassland. Four patterns of N application in spring and after the first cut (40-60, 50-50, 60-40 and 70-30%, respectively) were examined at two N rates (120 and 240 kg N ha -1 ) at 16 sites in Norway. In general, application pattern had only a minor effect on dry matter yield, although at the highest N rate the 50-50 and 60-40 patterns gave slightly higher yield than the other alternatives. The crop N removal indicated a poor utilization of N at high application rates. It is concluded that grassland is flexible to the N application pattern in a two-cut system, and that the spring application rate should not be too low in order to ensure both high yield in the first cut and sufficient plant N reserves for rapid regrowth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In order to select molecular markers suitable for the seed control practice, 12 regionally cultivated spring wheat varieties were analysed by 41 microsatellite markers (SSRs). The analysed group included a pair (‘Satu’-‘Helle’) and a triplet (‘Tjalve’-‘Vinjett’-‘SWEstrad’) of varieties derived from each other. A dendrogram resulting from analysis of the matrix of dissimilarities discriminated all varieties, and in full agreement with the pedigree data, the varieties were divided into three groups consisting of Nordic, German and Dutch varieties, respectively. In the genetically close Nordic subgroup, Swedish varieties ‘Vinjett’ and ‘SWEstrad’ could be distinguished only by three of the analysed 41 SSR markers. An attempt was made to analyse genetic diversity in the group on the basis of morphological characteristics evaluated according to the UPOV guidelines. The clustering of morphological data resulted in a dendrogram which agreed neither with the known pedigree data nor with the conducted SSR analysis. Multilocus SSR analysis revealed heterogeneity in the analysed plant material. In order to monitor inheritance of the detected heterogeneous or null-alleles, six breeding lines derived from the studied varieties were analysed. In two of the breeding lines, non-parental SSR alleles were detected. Outcrossing is suggested as a possible source of the inconsistent alleles. A minimal set of molecular markers needed to identify/verify a variety in a group can be composed of markers amplifying fragments unique in the group length. In this study, identifying markers were found for seven varieties of the group; the remaining five varieties could be identified in the group by combinations of two or three microsatellite markers.",

The seasonal timing of shoot growth and flower initiation were monitored in three years. The morphological floral stages of the flower bud formation process were examined for the cultivar 'Celina'. Seven floral stages were identified and described. The date of full bloom varied between years as a function of the currently accumulated heat sum in early spring. Still, the earliness ranking of the cultivars was consistent across years for both flower initiation and blooming. The cultivars 'Anna' and 'Ingeborg' consistently initiated floral primordia 2–3 weeks earlier than 'Celina', 'Clara Frijs', 'Fritjof' and 'Kristina', and this was accompanied with 4–5 days earlier blooming in the following spring. The early flower initiation cultivars 'Anna' and 'Ingeborg' also had richer flowering than the late-blooming cultivars. 'Fritjof' was identified as a suitable pollinator for 'Celina' in the Nordic climate. Comparison of the flowering phenology of pear and apple cultivars showed that while the pears, on average, flowered a week ahead of the apples, they initiated flower primordia almost two weeks later, thus rendering the intervening period approximately three weeks longer in pear than in apple.",

Under such conditions, off-farm waste-derived nutrient resources may be an alternative to meet the N demand. In this study, we described a production method for a shrimp shell (SS) pellet product and evaluated the N fertiliser effect and N recovery efficiency (NRE) in a controlled climate pot experiment with potatoes. The experiment was set up with low, medium and high N levels of SS pellets in comparison with a standard mineral fertiliser (MF) at 9°C, 15°C and 21°C. In a separate study, we examined the loss of N as N2O from SS pellets in comparison with SS powder in a 100 days incubation experiment. The results documented the possibility to formulate a fertiliser pellet product from SS, and that SS pellets were an effective N fertiliser in potato at all growth temperatures. Nevertheless, a slightly slower development and lower tuber yields than for MF indicated a delayed N-availability from SS pellet fertiliser. NRE after use of MF was around 90%, and about 70% for the different levels of SS pellets. The incubation experiment showed a higher rate of available N for SS powder than for pellets (67% and 39%, respectively) after 100 days of incubation at constant humidity and temperature. This difference was attributed to a lower degree of dissolved materials and a higher rate of denitrification and N2O emissions for pellets than for powder, probably caused by differences in physical properties, occurrence of anoxic hotspots and higher microbial activity around and inside the SS pellets.",

Parasitism of C. australis significantly decreased the relative abundance of the bacterial phylum Nitrospirae, while it significantly increased that of Verrucomicrobia. Parasitism of C. australis significantly decreased the relative abundance of 10 bacterial genera, while it significantly increased those of nine genera. The Chao 1 indexes of the rhizospheric soil bacterial community of parasitised T. repens were significantly lower than those of non-parasitised T. repens. Principal coordinate analysis (based on the genus) and principal component analysis (based on the predicted gene function of bacterial communities) showed that rhizospheric bacterial communities from parasitised and non-parasitised T. repens differed and can be divided into two groups. These results suggest that infection of the holoparasitic plant could indirectly change the composition, diversity, and function of rhizospheric soil bacteria of the host plant.",

Two lines (BND3085 and BND3106) were grown at four sites across latitudes ranging from 52°N to 3°S. BND3085 and BND3106 seeds from Saskatoon grown plants (52°N) had the least damaged seed coats but the highest degree of electrolyte leakage from the seed and the lowest maximum germination rates. The Saskatoon (BND3085 and BND3106) and Nunhem (BND3106) seed lots had the lowest maximum germination rates when germinated at 28°C, 12°C, or when exposed to saline (100 mM NaCl) conditions. Saskatoon BND3085 seed produced plants with the lowest aboveground vegetative and total seed dry matter as well as the lowest pod number per plant. In contrast, plants grown from Saskatoon BND3106 seed produced 1.5-fold more total pods, 1.3-fold more total pods and 1.4-fold higher seed dry matter per plant as compared to plants grown from the Nunhem (51°N) or Arusha seed sources. This resulted in a 2.4–4.5% higher harvest index. These results suggest cultivar-specific dwarf French bean seed propagation at more northern sites may increase the productivity of the resulting crop.",

In each of the six-field crop rotation systems, there were five potato cultivars classified into different earliness groups. The following macronutrients in dry mass of potato tubers were determined: N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, S and Cl, and the various ratios between them were calculated. The research carried out proved that potatoes production systems affect the chemical composition of tubers, which is additionally modified by whether condition and genetic features of cultivars. Potato tubers from organic farming contained by about 20% less N than tubers from conventional or integrated systems. Potato tubers from organic production system displayed lower content of Ca and Na in comparison with the conventional and integrated systems. The least of P and S were detected in tubers of the potatoes grown conventionally.",

A greenhouse fully factorial experiment studied the effects of A. euteches, B. velezensis and L. terrestris on the emergence, growth and health of pea plants. The factors B. velezensis and L. terrestris resulted in taller plants (p = .003 and p = .030). B. velezensis treatment resulted in a higher biomass of shoots and roots (p ≤ .001 and p = .005). The effects increased with the presence of both factors (p = .036). Earthworms reduced the disease symptoms significantly (p = .032). The decreased disease symptoms caused by the earthworms might be due to the consumption of A. euteiches (direct effect) as well as soil disturbance (indirect effect). Interactions between the microorganisms added and the earthworms were shown. B. velezensis and L. terrestris can be useful for enhancement of plant growth and for biological control of root-rot in peas.",

This work applied mathematical modelling to improve geometric and physical parameters of a ploughshare body design that define the ploughing performance. The optimised reversible plough was tested in the field by comparing it with a conventional PLP-6-35A plough, which has a rectangular-shaped ploughshare. The trapezoid-shaped design of the ploughshare blade was found to be the most effective solution among the examined. Based on the empirical results, it can be concluded that the draft resistance of trapezoid-shaped plough bottom is 9.9% lower compared to that of the reference one. In addition, the study found that using a trapezoid-shaped plough bottom instead of rectangular-shaped ploughshare blades could increase the ploughing speed by 5.4%, from 2.13 to 2.25 m/s. This effect stems from the reduction in tractor slippage and allow saving 11.09% of fuel. The proposed mathematical model can be used to build a reversible plough with optimised technological characteristics.",

The multi-site testing results show that potato breeding based in Scandinavia offers to the growers of the Nordic Region of Europe cultivars for prevailing farming environments and end-user needs rather than relying, as happens today in the market, on foreign cultivars. These cultivars bred elsewhere are not always very suitable for the challenging Nordic agroecosystems, as shown by the results of the multi-site testing herein.

Chickpea seedlings were grown in the field and subjected to different NaCl concentrations (0, 50 and 150 mM) and P application (90 kg ha–1). The experimental design was based on a completely randomised design with three replications. Salinity has disturbed the physiological and ionic state of cells by increasing stomatal resistance and significantly decreased growth and yield parameters (−66%). Under salinity, plant growth traits presented a negative correlation with yield components. P application had positive effect on growth parameters and physiological responses of the plants. Our results suggest that the tolerance of chickpea at (NaCl × P) combination is closely associated with ionic homeostasis and physiological activities of the plants. Phosphorus application allowed salinity tolerance by increasing leaf hydraulic statute, improvement of KUE and consequently enhanced grain yield of chickpea. (P × salinity) combination induced a positive correlation between vegetative traits and yield parameters like unstressed treatment. These results suggest that the use of suitable amounts of phosphorus fertiliser (i. e. 90 kg ha–1) to saline soil is a beneficial starter for plant development, yield components and rehabilitation of degraded soils.",

    "abstract": "Corn rust disease can be classified into four types: common corn rust, southern corn rust, tropical corn rust and stem corn rust. In this paper, 270 samples of corn rust gathered from Yunnan province were identified by observation of symptom and pathogen morphology, detection of specific molecular markers between Puccinia sorghi Schw and Puccinia polysora Unedrw. The results showed that 180 samples of corn rust collected form Qujing, Zhaotong, Kunming, Honghe (Mile, Kaiyuan and Jianshui) were common corn rust caused by Puccinia sorghi Schw; and 90 samples of corn rust collected form Wenshan and Honghe (Pinbian) were southern corn rust. Morphology and aspect ratio compared Puccinia sorghi Schw with Puccinia polysora Unedrw. The uredospores of Puccinia polysora Unedrw were oval and the aspect ratio of 81.6% of all uredospores from Puccinia polysora Unedrw was greater than 1.2. The uredospores of Puccinia sorghi Schw were nearly round, and their aspect ratio was 1.0-1.3. In addition, the population genetic structure of all corn rust samples was analyzed by ISSR molecular marker. Concerning Puccinia polysora Unedrw, the genetic diversity was larger in Wenshan than in Honghe. In Puccinia sorghi Schw, the population genetic diversity was larger in Zhaotong and the lowest in Kunming.",

    "abstract": "Well-balanced nutrition is important for the successful cultivation of healthy plants. In this paper, we demonstrate a nondestructive optical method that can sense a deficiency of certain nutrients. The setup was tested on hydroponically grown Ocimum basilicum. The plants were subjected to nutrient deficiency by the exclusion of one of the essential elements (Fe, Mg, P, N) from the hydroponic solution. A control group of plants, fed by the balanced hydroponic solution, was also grown under the same conditions. The proposed method tracks and records the optical transmittance of the plants' leaves. All groups exhibit clearly defined day-night Circadian rhythms. When compared to the control group, the treated plants exhibited modified circadian rhythms of the optical transmission, suggesting an early indicator of the plants' stress. The condition of the plants under test was also assessed by the more common (destructive) methods such as: measurements of the determination of the photosynthetic pigment content, dray weight determination and the efficiency of PSII. Several biological parameters were observed, calculated and compared to the graphs of optical transmission dependence in real time. Presented results have demonstrated a significant potential of the proposed optical method for the early detection of plants' stress in hydroponic cultivation.",

Two different prediction methods were tested: linear regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Linear regression based on the best-performing vegetation index (the chlorophyll index) was found to be approximately as accurate as the best performing MARS model with multiple predictor variables in leave-one-trial-out cross-validation (R2 = 0.71, R2 = 0.70 and mean absolute error 0.64%, 0.60% CP respectively). Models applied on satellite data explained to a small degree between-field variations in CP (R2 = 0.36), however did not reproduce within-field variation accurately. The results of the different methods presented here show the differences between methods used and their potential for application in a DSS.",

In addition, swathing was examined as an alternative in two red clover trials in 2020. While none of the tested chemicals were superior to diquat, the most promising alternatives were Harmonix FoliaPlus and Harmonix LeafActive in red clover or Harmonix FoliaPlus in white clover. Although usually less effective than these products, Beloukha also had an acceptable desiccation effect, especially when sprayed early and late. Swathing before harvest, using finger bar cutters, was an effective drying method under favourable weather conditions.",

Field experiments were conducted to determine the effectiveness of an integrated approach consisting of host resistance and fungicides to reduce ascochyta blight progression and enhance yield performances of field pea for two seasons at Bonke and Chencha, Southern Ethiopia. Three field pea (Bursa, Burqitu and Tegegnech) varieties and three systemic (Carbonchlor, Matico and Othello-Top) fungicides, along with unsprayed controls, were arranged in a factorial randomised complete block design with three replications. Results showed that fungicide treated plots of each variety recorded the lowest progress rate, while control plots of Bursa, Burqitu and Tegegnech recorded the highest rate parameter (0.67, 0.60 and 0.451 units day−1), respectively at Bonke. Terminal mean severities were reduced by up to 24.6–43.7% and 20.1–43.7% due to fungicide applications over unsprayed plots at Chencha and Bonke, respectively. Moreover, triple applications of Othello-Top enhanced grain yield by 211% (Bursa), 204% (Burqitu) and 140% (Tegegnech) as compared to control plots at Bonke. A related pattern was noticed at Chencha areas. Economically, Burqitu with Othello-Top showed the highest net benefit and benefit–cost ratio of $2.35 × 103 ha−1 and 4.77 (Bonke) and 2.27 × 103 ha−1 and 3.76 (Chencha) in that order of presentation, followed by Matico, and found to be the most profitable management option due to monetary advantage; and it could be suggested for field pea growers.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate Sphagnum moss and two substrate mixes containing peat and coir or perlite as alternatives for a pure peat substrate in arctic bramble container cultivation, with particular interest on Sphagnum moss. The experiment was conducted in plastic high tunnel in plant towers with three planting levels (Top, Middle, Bottom). The substrates used were unfertilised peat (UP), an UP and perlite mix (80/20 by dry loose volume) (UPP), an UP and commercial coir mix (50/50) (UPCoir) and unfertilised Sphagnum moss (SM). Plant vigour was higher in SM compared to UP and UPP, while total fruit yield, mean fruit weight and individual drupelet weight were higher in SM compared to UPP. Both plant vigour and fruit yield were substantially reduced on Middle and especially Bottom level, compared to the Top level of plant towers. Water retention measurement of pure substrate materials showed higher air volume content in SM compared to UP or pure coir material. We conclude that Sphagnum moss is a highly promising substitute for peat as a substrate in arctic bramble container cultivation.",

After three nematode generations, the regional effects had no influence on final nematode population densities, whereas the differential host plants significantly segregated the nematode reproductive potentials. On Olea europaea reproductive potentials (eggs and juveniles/g) were zero, whereas those on Citrus jambhiri and Poncirus trifoliata ranged from 79 to 482 and 86 to 433, respectively. All T. semipenetrans isolates, regardless of the soil group and climate type, behaved similarly to the Poncirus biotype, which therefore rules out the existence of multiple T. semipenetrans biotypes in South Africa.",

Farmland usually has a high potential for carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake from the atmosphere, but also for emission. Data from different areas are valuable for global SOC calculations and model development, and a survey of 108 agricultural fields in Lanzhou, China was performed. The fields were grouped by: cropping intensity (3 levels), cropping methodology (3), and crop species (10). Intensive cropping (two or more crops per year, typically vegetables), moderate (annuals in monoculture: wheat, maize, potato, melons), and extensive (orchards, lily [Lilium brownii] fields, fallow) were the intensity classes; and open field, greenhouse field, and sand-covered field (10–20 cm added on top of the topsoil) were the three methodologies. SOC concentration, pH, electrical conductivity, and soil bulk density were measured, and SOC mass (g·m−2 0–20 cm depth) was calculated. SOC concentration was high in cauliflower, wheat, leaf vegetables, and fruit vegetables; moderate in potato, fallow (3–5 years), tree orchards, and melons; while low in lily and maize fields, and differences in SOC mass followed the same pattern. SOC concentration and mass were lowest in the extensive fields while moderate and intensive fields showed higher values. Soil bulk density in open fields was significantly lower than those in greenhouse and sand-covered fields. The climate-induced soil activity factor re_clim was calculated, compared with European conditions, and was fairly similar to those in central Sweden. Other factors behind the measured results, such as the influence of initial SOC content, manure addition, crops, etc., are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The market for cereal straw has diminished in many seed-production areas due to less livestock. Seed growers, therefore, want to chop and return the straw. The objective was to investigate the effect of cover crop stubble height and straw management on vegetative growth in autumn and the following year's seed yield of timothy, meadow fescue, and red clover. The plan included two stubble heights (5–10 cm and 20–30 cm) combined with four different straw and stubble managements, (A) straw removal, (B) straw chopping at combining, (C) flail-chopping with tractor after combining, and (D) straw chopping in two operations (B + C). The cover crop was either spring barley or spring wheat. On average for all trials and plots where the straw was removed, by the end of the sowing year, a tendency of 9% more tillers of meadow fescue, 29% more tillers of timothy, and 27% more plants of red clover was produced on plots with short than with long stubble. In the following year, the average seed yields were not significantly affected by stubble height in meadow fescue and timothy, but 11% higher on plots with short than with long stubble in red clover. This indicates that red clover is more vulnerable to the shade created by a long stubble than the two grass species. When the stubble was short, straw chopping produced equally high seed yields as straw removal in all species. For seed growers without their own husbandry or not receiving any payment for the cover crop straw, chopping of straw is, therefore, recommended as an environmentally sound and cost-saving alternative to straw removal. The straw must be chopped with sharp knives as finely as possible and spread evenly on the soil surface to facilitate rapid decomposition and rapid penetration by the undersown seed crop.",

    "abstract": "Estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) storage for soils with discontinuous distribution in the karst regions of southwest China poses a challenge due to the predominant carbonate bedrock. In addition, it is not clear how effective the ecological restoration and reconstruction policies, which have been conducted in this region since the 1990s, have been in terms of SOC sequestration. In this study, we explored the ability of an empirical model and validated it using field survey data to predict the coverage of discontinuous distribution soil in a karst region in southwest China. Employing the soil coverage map, survey data of SOC at a soil depth of 0–15 cm, and three land use/cover maps in 1990, 2004, and 2011, we estimated the changes of SOC storages in the study area. Results showed that the land use/cover changes induced by the implementation of ecological restoration policies promoted SOC storage in the karst region. The SOC storage increased from 2.34 Tg to 3.01 Tg and soil organic carbon density increased from 2.72 kg/m2 to 3.50 kg/m2 over the study period. The mountain closure policy, Grain for Green program, and migration program currently implemented in the karst region have contributed to a decline in the rate of SOC decomposition and the reduction of soil disturbance, which resulted in carbon sequestration in the global carbon cycle while also improving the ecologically fragile karst environment. SOC storage may have been overestimated by almost twofold while ignoring the discontinuous distribution features of soil cover in the karst region. However, along with an increase in both population and agricultural activities, SOC storage in the nonkarst area declined from 1990 to 2011. With the ecological restoration occurring in the karst area, losses of SOC induced by increased farming activities in the nonkarst area should not be ignored.",

Nine butterhead lettuce cultivars were evaluated in soil cultivation under a 40% white shadenet structure during the winter season on an experimental farm of the Agricultural Research Council – Vegetable and Ornamental Plant Institute (ARC-VOPI). The experiment was laid out as a randomised complete block design with five replicates. During harvest, 10 plants from each cultivar per replicate were assessed for yield, and five uniform heads were cut longitudinally for internal quality assessment. Quality assessment included compactness, uniformity, tipburn, disease tolerance and bolting tolerance. Results showed that head mass, height, diameter, uniformity, compactness, tipburn, disease tolerance and internal quality were significantly affected by cultivar choice. Recommended cultivars which outperformed the control (Ofelia) based on uniformity, tipburn and percentage marketable harvest were Analena, Fabieto RZ, Lobela and Rousso RZ. Results thus indicate that improved yield and quality of butterhead lettuce cultivars can be obtained by selecting the correct cultivar for winter production.",

Treatments applied include fresh T. diversifolia (GM), PM, T. diversifolia composted with PM, organo-mineral fertilizers (OMF), neem fertilizer (NF), inorganic fertilizer (20-10-10 NPK), and control in a randomized complete block design and replicated four times. Soil samples were collected at 0–20 cm depth to determine near steady-state infiltration rates (Is), sorptivity, transmissivity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), macroporosity (MacP), microporosity (MicP), air capacity (AC), and relative water capacity (RWC). The Is rates were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced to optimum range with the addition of the organic fertilizers over very high value (128.7 cm hr−1) observed for control. Whereas, Ks was enhanced in the order: GM > compost (CP) > NF > inorganic fertilizer > control > organo-mineral fertilizer > PM. Sorptivity and transmissivity were highest in control and inorganic fertilizer plots, indicating that the addition of organic fertilizers lowered these parameters while MacP, MicP, AC, and RWC were generally increased with the addition of organic-based and inorganic fertilizers. Specifically, NF increased MicP by 34% over control. Values for RWC which were within the optimum range (0.60–0.70) were only obtained with NF (0.74), OMF (0.72), NPK (0.70), and GM (0.60). The SPQ parameters assessed in this study were enhanced by the addition of fresh T. diversifolia applied as GM and CP compared to other treatments. Therefore, T. diversifolia usually burned by farmers should instead be incorporated into the soil as manure.",

Therefore, an experiment was conducted to elucidate the performances of 27 globally diverse blast-resistant upland rice genotypes in terms of morphological, physiological and yield trait characteristics and to determine the correlations between and assess the diversity among these characteristics. All of the genotypes were evaluated in a randomised complete block design with three replications. Analysis of variance revealed 18 traits with significant to highly significant variations among themselves. The BRRI dhan42, BRRI dhan43, Ja Loy, C, Choke Tang and Chirikata 2 genotypes matured early, and the Chirikata 2, C, Choke Tang, BRRI dhan43 and Padi Beleong genotypes were best in terms of yield. The greatest heritability was recorded for the numbers of filled grains/panicle and the yield/plant, which demonstrated that these traits can be successfully transferred to the offspring if selection for these characteristics is performed in a hybridisation programme. The 27 genotypes were grouped into six clusters based on the contributing morphological, physiological and yield characteristics. The first four principal components accounted for 40, 59, 70 and 79% of the total variation, respectively, which indicated abundant genetic differences between these genotypes. The Chirikata 2, C, Choke Tang and BRRI dhan43 were selected as the best genotypes and could be used as valuable resources for high-yielding, early maturing, blast-resistant cultivars and parental sources for hybridisation programmes for challenging environments in the future.",

Yields under ORG were significantly lower than those under CON, whereas the NUpE in organic pakchoi were significantly higher than those in conventional pakchoi. In winter, a significant interaction between the management system and cultivar for NUtE was observed. In addition, all the traits determined were significantly influenced by the cultivar. Among cultivars, the yield was closely correlated with the NUpE under ORG and CON, except under ORG in fall. The cultivar ranking analysis showed a rank correlation for yield, NUpE and NUtE in winter, while no rank correlation was observed in fall. The rankings of cultivars showed major changes between ORG and CON in fall. In conclusion, the selection of cultivars with high NUpE and direct selection of cultivars under organic agriculture, particularly in fall, will be helpful to improve the yield.",

Literature worldwide lacks works on the impact of herbicides on the brewing quality of barley. This work presents the results of field experiments and laboratory studies concerning the evaluation of the impact of herbicides, differing in terms of an active substance, on the yields, weed control and malting quality of selected cultivars of barley. The research was conducted in Poland. The herbicides affected the increase in grain yields of barley, due to their high effectiveness of weed control, resulting in an increase in the number of ears per area unit. Certain herbicides increased grain protein content and grain filling. As for malt extractivity, Kolbach index, Q index, diastatic power and beta-glucans content in wort, there were interactions between herbicides and cultivars. The impact of herbicides on parameters varied depending on cultivars. The herbicides, especially Chwastox Turbo 340 SL (MCPA + dicamba) and Secator 125 OD (amidosulfuron + iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium), worsened several (not many) malt quality parameters, depending on cultivars, but it did not contribute to disqualifying malting quality of grains. Therefore, all tested herbicides can be recommended for use by farmers.",

    "abstract": "Although significant differences in soil nitrogen levels exist under different paddy-upland rotations, the main reason for this is unclear. The nitrogen retention capacity and loss of ammonia volatilisation, leaching, etc. of paddy soil with large differences in nitrogen levels from two long-term rotations, garlic-rice and wheat-rice, were measured using the soil column simulation method. The results showed that the loss rate of leaching was only 5.4%, whereas that of ammonia volatilisation was up to 22.8%, which was the main nitrogen loss way of paddy soil under the two rotations. The average ammonia volatilisation rates under wheat-rice rotation with high and low nitrogen application rates were 12.1% and 40.2% higher than that under garlic-rice rotation, leading to a decrease in the total nitrogen loss amount and rate through ammonia volatilisation by 29.8% and 8.8%, respectively. As a result, nitrogen retention in the soil under garlic-rice rotation increased by 12.7%. In conclusion, the long-term garlic-rice rotation could significantly inhibit ammonia volatilisation, thus improving the soil nitrogen retention capacity. The straw return may increase soil organic matter content, reduce ammonia volatilisation loss, and enhance soil nitrogen retention capacity and productivity.",

Moreover, the effect of fertiliser treatments was more pronounced in the clay than the sandy soil. Our investigation is the first to document the effects of fertiliser treatment, genotype, and soil type on the accumulation of rhizosphere nutrients in field-grown chickpea.

Identification of key variables of resilience support actors and policymakers managing the food systems.

We operationalised the key variables of resilience in the Finnish food system and evaluated them using a Delphi expert method. We produced a framework for food system resilience, including three indispensable interacting levels of action and good practices within each supporting resilience building. In the prioritisation of key variables, diversity in production, versatile cooperation between actors based on trust, independence of external inputs, system understanding, and renewable domestic energy were considered the most important. Research and administration play a key role in producing information and implementing actions targeted especially at agriculture, where actions are expected to be the most efficient and impactful. In the whole food system, increasing transparency would help create trust and thus promote co-creation of sustainable practices. Platforms to obtain information about future risks and for co-creating solutions for building food system resilience are needed.",

The yield density relationship is given by w = A/[1+(A/B) (N—N 0)] where w is the mean plant dry weight and N is the perceived plant density. Parameter A is the mean plant weight at density N 0 and B is the potential yield per unit area. The density model estimates the perceived density of a species, which is the monoculture density where the dry weight per plant is the same as that observed in the mixed population. For each species, the density is added to the density of the competing species converted into a corresponding number of monoculture plants, giving the perceived density. Data of 21 observation times covering two years' results of barley and oilseed rape grown under both greenhouse and field conditions were tested for deviations from an asymptotic yield density relationship, and for density dependence of the substitutions rates. The results showed no deviations from an asymptotic relationship between biomass yield per unit area and density, but in more than half of the observation times the substitutions rates were dependent on the density of the competing species. The perceived density of species 1 was therefore N = N 1 + c(1 + qN 2)N 2 where N is the perceived plant density and N 1 and N 2 are the observed densities of the two species in the mixed population. The substitution rate, c(1 + qN 2), was linearly related to the density of the competing species. In the barley populations, the substitution rates of oilseed rape were negatively related to increased densities of oilseed rape. In the oilseed rape populations, the substitution rates of barley were positively related to increased densities of barley. Barley was generally a better competitor than oilseed rape.

The genotype × year interaction was more important than genotype × location in affecting the quantity to quality ratio. Genetic variatia were observed in harvest index, 1000-grain weight, grain and flour protein content as well as in gluten content. A large direct environmental effect was detected for the protein content of grain and flour, gluten content and dough quality measured with farinograph data. The environment also appeared to regulate strongly the duration of the reproductive period, which seemed to be the main factor affecting the quantity to quality ratio. The genotypic and environmental variatia in grain-filling period and the variatia in relative amount of protein groups were low, thus reducing the potential to improve these characters by breeding. However, the longer the grain-filling period of the genotype, the poorer was the bread-making quality. It is suggested that attention should not be paid only to high molecular weight subunit composition of glutenins but also to the relative amount of S-rich prolamins (low molecular weight glutenin subunits, α-, β-, and γ-gliadins) to reduce the negative relationships between yielding ability and grain protein content.

Therefore, Co sorptions and extractions were carried out on samples from the B horizon in six Danish Spodosols. The investigation was carried out on untreated samples, on hydrogen peroxide-treated samples (to remove organic matter), on oxalate-treated samples (to remove amorphous to poorly crystalline Al and Fe oxides), on hydroxylamine-treated samples (to remove Mn oxides). Subfractions treated with hydrogen peroxide were further treated with oxalate and CBD (citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite). Sorption of Co from an initial 10−6 M solution after 48 h was determined in the pH range 3 to 8 using 0.1 M NaNO3 as background electrolyte. The pH-dependent sorption curve (sorption edge) was shifted to higher pH with decreasing Al oxide content in the soils and, for the treated samples, after removal of Al and Fe oxides. Negligible effects were seen after removal of the Mn oxides, because of their low abundance, and of organic matter. Extraction of at pH 5-7.5 with 0.1 M HNO3 for 24 h confirmed the sorption results, inasmuch as removal of the Al (and Fe) oxides increased Co extractability. Therefore, it is concluded that in the soils investigated Co retention is mainly determined by the oxalate-extractable Al fraction with minor contribution from crystalline Fe oxides.",

Uptake and utilization of N by wheat plants are influenced by environment and variety, and consequently supplementary N may be needed during the growing season according to variations in these factors. Additional N can be applied at specific stages of plant development (phenology) for maximum effect. However, timing supplemental N application according to growth stage scales may not result in maximum yield as the scales do not provide sufficiently precise indication of spikelet and floret formation, which critically affect the sink capacity of the plant. In this review it is proposed that knowledge of apical development offers a means to identify the initiation and formation of those plant organs that are indicators of specific stages of plant development. Aspects of the general usage of apical development stages in timing N, and how they vary according to growing conditions, are discussed.",

Frosts that injured carrots and resulted in a decline in sugar content in 1996 did not influence sensory quality. Storage had little effect on sensory quality, but juiciness and crispness frequently received lower gradings after storage.

    "abstract": "The lipids derived from plant seeds provide approximately 20% of dietary calories in developed nations. The fatty acid composition of these dietary oils can influence several components of long-term health. Almost all the genes involved in producing dietary oils are now isolated, allowing rational modifications in saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid content in foods. Several of these genes have been identified using genomic approaches. However, many questions about the regulation of plant lipid metabolism seem difficult to solve using conventional biochemical or molecular approaches. For example, we have little understanding of why or how some seeds produce >50% oil whereas other seeds store largely carbohydrate or protein. Major control over complex plant biochemical pathways may only become possible by understanding regulatory networks which provide 'global' control over these pathways. To begin to discover such networks and provide a broad analysis of gene expression in developing oilseeds, we have taken two genomic approaches: 1) We have sequenced 10,500 expressed sequence tags (EST) from developing Arabidopsis seeds and analyzed these using different bioinformatics tools. Approximately 30% of the ESTs have no match in dbEST, suggesting many represent mRNAs derived from genes that are specifically expressed in seeds. 'Electronic northern' analysis of EST abundance data has provided insights into the import of photosynthate into developing embryos, its conversion into seed oil and the regulation of this pathway. 2) We have produced microarrays which display ca. 4000 seed-expressed Arabidopsis genes. Sensitivity of the arrays is estimated at 1–2 copies mRNA/cell. The arrays have been hybridized with probes derived from seeds, leaves, and roots and analysis of expression ratios between the different tissues has allowed the tissue-specific expression patterns of many hundreds of genes to be described for the first time. Approximately 10% of the genes were expressed at ratios ≥10-fold higher in seeds than leaves or roots. We also identified several transcription factors, as well as kinases and phosphatases, whose expression changed during the seed development, and which may be involved in the regulation of the storage compound synthesis. Moreover, cluster analysis of the expression profiles established distinct groups of co-regulated genes.",

Annual herbage yields usually exceeded 5 Mg ha-1 on neutral soils at Fairbanks (64°52' W) and on moderately acidic soils at Point MacKenzie (61°24' N, 150°3' W). Strongly acidic, droughty soils at Delta Junction (63°55' N, 145°20' W) produced low yields for all crops. Soil pH decreased significantly over 4 years under N-fertilized grasses at Delta Junction and under alfalfa and N-fertilized barley at Fairbanks. Soil organic C and N and microbial biomass C showed no differences among treatments at the end of the study. Wet aggregate stability did not vary significantly among crops but was lower for fallow. The results of this study indicated a high potential for use of perennial forage legumes at some locations in Alaska. The lack of large differences in most soil parameters indicates slow responsiveness to management by some commonly used soilquality indicators under subarctic conditions.",

Detailed and densely sampled soil electrical conductivity (EC) data with a distinct border between two different regions was used for dividing the field into two zones. Averages from these zones gave better prediction for most variables than interpolation without respect to the border. With the border taken into account, cokriging with EC as a covariable improved the prediction, whereas the improvement with ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting (IDW) was insignificant. Direct interpretation of EC by a simple linear regression model gave reasonable predictions for clay content.

In order to secure a desired concentration of Se in crops, Se has been applied as mineral fertilizer to agricultural fields. Since only a minor part of the inorganic Se applied is utilized by plants and small increases in Se concentrations in, e.g., drinking water, may be toxic, the method is somewhat controversial. As an alternative to Se-enriched mineral fertilizer, different seafood-processing wastes have been examined as a source for Se in crop production. Both in greenhouse pot experiments and field trials the Se in seafood waste was not plant-available during the first growing season. There was no significant difference between the Se concentration in wheat growing in soil without added Se and in soil receiving Se from seafood waste in amounts ranging from 0.9 to 9 g ha−1. Neither was any residual effect of Se in seafood waste seen during a second year growth period. Thus, seafood-processing waste cannot be regarded as a potential source of Se in crop production. Possible mobilization of formerly applied Se, as seafood-processing waste or Se enriched mineral fertilizer due to changes in soil redox conditions were examined in a leaching experiment. The mobility of formerly applied Se was generally very low, but the results indicated that under permanently wet soil conditions leaching of Se may occur in plant dormant periods in soils with low organic matter content and high pH.",

Excessive irrigation weakened the winter survival of raspberry (cv. ‘Jatsi’) and the optimal irrigation threshold was −600 hPa. Fertilization method had no remarkable effect on winter survival.

In Italy, volcanic rocks provide a large availability of internally porous materials such as pumice, lapillus and zeolite. Volcanic sands are currently used as substitutes of silica sand. In order to assess the suitability of these volcanic materials for sand amelioration and/or as construction materials, the present research was aimed at studying the water retention and release of these materials considering different particle size distributions and a non-porous silica sand as a reference. Water retention curves were constructed for the internally porous sands as: (a) raw material, (b) graded material with the same particle size distribution of a non-internally porous silica sand. Additionally, available water was determined on specific sand fractions namely coarse sand (0.5–1.0 mm) and medium sand (0.25–0.5 mm) of all the materials. The available water content of raw volcanic materials was higher than of graded sands made of the same materials, thus showing the expected effect of texture on water retention. The comparison of water retention properties of the internally porous materials and non-internally porous silica sand with the same particle size distribution, showed a significant contribution given by internal porosity to water retention. Volcanic coarse sand fraction showed higher water availability than volcanic medium sand fraction. Volcanic materials used as amendments could enhance the water availability of sand-based rootzones, but if used as raw materials the possibility exists for the final mix not to meet the specifications for sports use. The use of sole volcanic sands as rootzone material could have a major impact on water-holding capacity, and hence on management, although investigation on their particle stability is still needed.",

This article attempted to examine the concentration levels, temporal dynamics and long-term trends (1993–2009 and 1996–2009) of Al, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn in streams draining the catchment areas of Skuterud (4.5 km2) and Mørdre (6.8 km2), located in south-east Norway. In the Mørdre stream, Al, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn all showed statistically significant downward trends (p<0.05), whilst in the Skuterud stream only Al and Fe showed statistically downward significance (p<0.05). The general declining trends of metal concentrations are most likely associated with reduction of acid rain deposition in southern Norway. In spite of this declining trends, over the 14–17 years of monitoring mean monthly concentrations of total Al (2.0–3.2 mg L−1), Fe (1.3–2.5 mg L−1) and Cu (8.9–26.1 µg L−1) in Skuterud and Mørdre streams, respectively exceeded the limits of the Norwegian Water Framework Directives, whereas the concentrations of Mn (22.3–40.8 µg L−1) and Zn (13.1–99.4 µg L−1) fell within the range of desired limits. Of the total water samples analysed from Skuterud (n=370) and Mørdre streams (n=255), nearly 80–84%, 70–87% and 79–96% were above the desired limits for Al (0.2 mg L−1), Fe (0.3 mg L−1) and Cu (3 µg L−1), respectively. In 2011, water analysis from drainage of forest soils (in Skuterud catchment) measured total Al: 0.42–0.79 mg L−1 and total Fe: 0.84–1.0 mg L−1 which were two to three folds greater than the desired limits. In general, weak correlations between runoff and concentrations of the metals in the streams were noted. Future research should focus on identifying the sources of Al, Fe and Cu and management interventions of elevated metal inputs to Skuterud and Mørdre streams.",

In contrast to the inefficiency of traditional method of planting, micropropagation by nodal cuttings allows to increase the multiplication and the rapid production of pathogen-free plant material. In this work, micropropagation of yam from both nodal cuttings and microtubers was first tested and compared. It appears that microtubers rapidly develop shoots, more rapidly than nodal cuttings. Respectively 16 and 28 weeks are needed to obtain 10 cm high shoots. In a second time, the two techniques of multiplication were used in parallel to improve the multiplication rate. So, one nodal cutting after 28 weeks of culture can be subcultured as nodal cuttings (for 28 other weeks) and as microtuber parts (for 16 weeks). At the end of each subculture of nodes or microtubers, nodal cuttings and microtubers were cut and subcultured. This technique allowed obtaining more rapidly a lot of microtubers. The use of nodal cuttings allowed obtaining about 3×104 cuttings in two years. The additional use of the formed microtubers and the division of the microtubers at the subculture in three parts increased this multiplication rate by 15. The importance of this work was to consider microtubers not only as final planting product, but also to include them in the in vitro multiplication protocol to drastically increase the production of cuttings and finally of microtubers.",

Furthermore, we describe the priming effect on the character of the seedling root system. Seed priming enhanced the germination percentage and accelerated the germination rate in all species, especially at lower temperatures.

Among the treatments currently used for such postharvest treatment, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) is an efficient inhibitor of the autocatalytic production of ethylene. Although postharvest 1-MCP treatment is used to counter ethylene activity and delay senescence in fresh produce, its potential application in cut flowers has not been adequately tested. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of 1-MCP treatment with modified atmosphere packaging on the shelf life of cut “Rosalin” gerberas. To this end, gerberas harvested at commercial maturity were divided into two groups: 1-MCP treatment (625 ppb at 4±1°C for 4 hours) and no treatment. Both groups of flowers were stored under normal and modified atmosphere conditions at 4±1°C and 80±5% relative humidity. The flowers were covered with materials of different characteristics for the modified atmosphere. To determine the differences between the treatments, quality parameters were examined in the flowers at 7-day intervals during the storage. The 1-MCP treatment with both the normal and modified atmosphere significantly reduced the overall postharvest loss in quality. The best results for the quality characteristics determined were obtained from the 1-MCP and 30 µm polyvinylchloride combined treatment. These results indicate that 1-MCP and a modified atmosphere treatment are good methods for extending the vase life, maintaining the visual quality, and reducing the loss of quality of gerberas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Norwegian agriculture relies heavily on a safe supply of seed of winter-hardy timothy cultivars. To buffer variations in seed consumption and seed yields, seed companies keep stocks corresponding to 50–100% of average annual seed consumption. Such large stocks are risky to maintain as seeds lose germination over time. Our objective was to elucidate the effect of seed harvest time and seed storage location on the longevity of timothy seed. In 2003, the Norwegian timothy cultivars, ‘Grindstad’, ‘Vega’ and ‘Noreng’, were combined directly at three different seed harvest times corresponding to a seed moisture content (SMC) of 33–35% (H1), 26–28% (H2) and 16–20% (H3), respectively. Germination analyses were conducted before storage and after 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months of storage in a conditioned seed store at Landvik (4°C, 30% RH) or in unconditioned warehouses at three climatically different locations (Tynset, Holstad and Vaksdal). Seed harvest time became increasingly significant as time went by. After 60 months seed harvested at 16–20% SMC (H3) germinated, on average for storage locations and cultivars, 24% units better than seed harvested at 33–35% SMC (H1). Seed stored in the conditioned store at Landvik germinated, on average for harvest times and cultivars, 4, 15 and 47 units better than seed stored at Tynset (continental), Holstad (intermediate) and Vaksdal (coastal), respectively. A significant interaction emphasised the importance of storing seed combined at a high SMC under optimal conditions in order to avoid germination loss. This linkage between harvest time and storage conditions for timothy seed longevity has not earlier been reported. Probably due to larger seeds that were more susceptible to mechanical damage, seed of ‘Grindstad’ usually had the lowest germination. These new results suggest that appropriate adjustment of drum speed and concave clearance is especially important when harvesting ‘Grindstad’.",

    "abstract": "Abstract On sandy paddy fields, key factors for successful crops in the dry season without irrigation are a shallow water table and practices such as deep seed-placement but only some legume species are adapted to such conditions. To understand the adaptation of legume species to deep seed-placement over shallow water tables, we studied their rooting patterns on two sandy soils. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), mungbean (Vigna radiata), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and soybean (Glycine max) seeds were sown shallow (∼5 cm) or deep (∼15 cm) in deep sandy soils after harvesting rice in two shallow water table locations in north-east Thailand. The legumes depended mainly on capillary water rising from the water table and none experienced water deficit throughout the growing season. Generally, deeper seed-placement decreased overall root dry weight, but it increased the root surface area to weight ratio. Deep seed-placement promoted a greater fraction of root growth into the subsoil for cowpea (86–99% of total root length), mungbean (61–93% of total root length) and peanut (78–98% of total root length) where the soil contained more water throughout the growing season. Moreover, deep seed-placement at the site with the lower water table promoted deeper penetration of roots of cowpea (∼20 cm deeper), mungbean (∼20–40 cm deeper) and peanut (∼20–40 cm deeper) which improved water access, especially late during the growing season when topsoils dried to close to wilting point. Unlike other species, the soybean rooting pattern did not respond much to seed-placement depths, or soil moisture.",

    "abstract": "Conservation tillage is becoming increasingly attractive to farmers due its potential to reduce production costs and allow a more sustainable land use as compared with conventional tillage. Field experiments were conducted over three consecutive growing seasons to study barley performance under three tillage systems (minimum, reduced, and conventional tillage) on two different soils (a sandy loam and a clay soil) of northern Greece. No significant differences in plant number, ear number, or grain yield were observed among tillage systems in any growing season in the sandy loam soil. By contrast, reduced plant number by 15 and 18% in the first growing season and by 18 and 21% in the third growing season was observed for the reduced and the minimum tillage system, respectively, in the clay soil as compared with conventional tillage. Reduced plant number in the clay soil was due to the unfavorable soil conditions during sowing and the uneven seedbed as a result of the presence of summer weeds which apparently prevented correct and uniform planting depth. However, no significant differences in ear number or barley grain yield were found among tillage systems in any growing season in the clay soil. Findings of this study showed that conservation tillage can affect the establishment of barley stands depending on soil type and weather conditions but this is not always expressed in grain-yield reduction due to the effect of compensation through increased tillering.",

In the farmland ecosystem, however, the quantitative characterization and mechanism involved in the distribution and transformation of the assimilated C in soil over the plant's life cycle are problems relatively easily ignored. Research in this area is therefore indispensable for a thorough understanding of the process and characteristics of the organic C cycle in farmland soil. This paper provides an overview on: (1) the distribution, transformation rules, and structural features of crop-assimilated C in soil and its contribution to SOC and the function of microorganisms in the transformation of assimilated C. (2) The chemical compositions and structural features of the assimilated C after its entry into soil organic matter. (3) The relationship between assimilated C, rhizosphere deposition, and C isotope technology. Based on the findings, we consider that further research on the distribution of crop-assimilated C in the soil–crop system and the quantitative relations of several C-transformation steps such as crop input, transformation, protection, and stabilization in different ecosystems should be conducted. Moreover, the component and structure of ‘new C’ input into the soil by rhizosphere deposition in C assimilation and its relationship with oxidation and mineralized stability should also be accounted for.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Different procedures for managing stubble and regrowth in meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) seed crops were examined in two experimental series in southeast Norway. The first series investigated cutting and removal of stubble shortly after seed harvest in late July/early August, combined with cutting of regrowth (forage harvest) in September or October or burning of the wilted aftermath in early spring. Except for one crop with more than 30-cm stubble, stubble removal shortly after seed harvest did not improve seed yield in the following year. On average for plots with and without stubble removal in seven seed crops, forage harvest on 5 September or 1 October reduced seed yield by 9 and 12%, respectively. The reductions were due to smaller inflorescences, probably reflecting lower carbohydrates reserves. In most trials, the highest seed yield, on average 9% above that of the uncut and unburned control, was found after burning in spring. The second experimental series investigated flail-chopping in spring as an alternative to burning, and the effect of delaying either of the two treatments. On average for four trials, burning and flail-chopping before growth initiation increased seed yield by, in turn, 20 and 12% compared with the untreated control. A two-to-three-week delay in fail-chopping had no negative impact, but a two-week delay in burning reduced seed yield back to the uncut/unburned control level. Based on these trials, growers are recommended to burn meadow fescue seed crops in early spring rather than removing stubble and regrowth in autumn. If burning in early spring is not possible, flail-chopping is recommended within two weeks after growth initiation.",

A total amount of 100–150 kg N ha−1 was broadcast or placed at sowing or applied as a split application at sowing and pre-elongation at the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences, location Flakkebjerg. Seed yields were positively affected by the high N applications, but no difference was observed between 150 kg N ha−1 broadcast at sowing, and 40 kg N ha−1 broadcast at sowing with an additional late application at a rate based on soil mineral N analysis. No consistent pattern was observed between N management strategy and seed weight or N management strategy and germination. A high N concentration in the plants at the start of growth showed negative effects on final seed yield, whereas later in the season there was a significantly positive correlation between N concentration in the plants and seed yield. A soil mineral analysis can be used as a tool to adjust the N application rate when a split application strategy is chosen.",

Natural-based products for RKN management have gained a lot of interest due to the harmful effects of conventional chemical nematicides. Two Alltech Crop Science products, (ACS5075 and ACS3048), were evaluated against the RKN Meloidogyne javanica. Attraction assays were performed by adding either product to 20% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 gel to study the behaviour of RKN second-stage juveniles (J2) towards host roots. ACS5075 completely inhibited attraction of RKN juveniles towards roots when compared to ACS3048 (7 ± 1 juveniles) or the control (8 ± 0.5 juveniles). Pot trials were also conducted for 2 months, where several combinations of products were assessed to determine their impact on egg masses and plant development. The ACS5075 treatment caused a significant reduction in egg masses (2.04 and 1.4 fold) when applied at 1% and 3% (p ≤ 0.05), respectively, compared to inoculated control. Correlation studies (r = −0.414) clearly depicted positive contribution of the product towards plant growth while reducing egg mass formation. A combination of 3% ACS5075 and 3 g ACS3048 behaved similarly. It is concluded that these products could potentially provide promising alternatives for sustainable RKN management.",

In this experiment, four root-zone temperatures (5, 10, 15, and 25°C) and a constant air temperature were considered. Results showed that there were differences among the grasspea landraces for nodulation and nitrogen fixation, growth and development, and dry matter. Low RZT reduced growth, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation in grasspea landraces. Strains had different effects on landraces. Inoculated plants with strain originating from cold areas produced the most nodule number, and plant nitrogen concentration at 15°C RZT, whereas inoculated plants with strain originating from temperate area produced the most nodule number, and plant nitrogen concentration at 25°C RZT. Nodulation, nitrogen fixation, and nitrogenase activities of inoculated plants with a strain originating from cold areas in inoculated plants were higher at low temperature than in inoculated plants with a strain originating from temperate areas. This experiment also showed that grasspea production is not likely to be successful when RZT is below 10°C, especially during vegetative development. Therefore, in the zones where soil temperature is greater than 10°C RZT, grasspea landraces have normal growth and produce average yields.",

Although the effects of adding sludge compost to turfgrass substrate have been widely investigated, the characteristics of commercial qualitative indicators of the generated turfgrass, substrate and sod products have been reported separately or incompletely. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the effects of recycling composted sludge to turfgrass on commercial qualitative indicators. The results revealed positive and negative effects of sludge compost on the investigated parameters, with some factors showing positive responses to addition of sludge compost to a threshold, above which negative responses were observed. For example, water-holding porosity, biomass and chlorophyll content increased in response to sludge amendment, but increased salinity and weed density, as well as decreased tensile strength and intactness were also observed. Overall, sludge compost in moderate dose is a suitable material for replacement of partial turfgrass substrate, but excessive dose results in adverse effects.",

The three sowing rates were 5, 10 and 15 kg ha–1 in timothy and meadow fescue and 3, 6 and 9 kg ha–1 in red clover. On average for sowing rates and all trials with timothy, meadow fescue and red clover, first year’s seed yields were 5–6%, 20–25% and 19–25% higher on plots sown with cover crop and seed crop in every other row than on plots where seed crop had been broadcast or sown perpendicularly to the cover crop. The different sowing methods had no effect on weed coverage or weed contamination in the cleaned seed. Increasing sowing rate usually had a negative influence on seed yield, while weed coverage/contamination was not significantly affected. It is concluded that organic seed crops should be established with cover crop and seed crop in every other row at a low sowing rate.

    "abstract": "The relationship between pyroxasulfone bioactivity and soil properties has not been investigated in a wide range of soils typical of western Canada. In this study, 47 soils from Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta, with varying organic matter content (1.5%–22.1%), pH (5.0–7.9), and clay content (6.8%–59.4%) were used to evaluate the effect of soil properties on pyroxasulfone bioactivity and its relevance to field application rates. Bioactivity was assessed by measuring the reduction of sugar beet shoot length after 7 days in response to 0, 92, 184, and 368 µg ai kg−1 pyroxasulfone concentration in soil. Multiple regression analysis showed that pyroxasulfone bioactivity was related to soil organic matter content, pH and clay content. Grouping the soils according to these properties allowed for a summarization of pyroxasulfone field application rates required to achieve bioactivity based on the magnitude of sugar beet shoot length inhibition (%). The estimated field application rates ranged from less than 120–480 g ai ha−1.",

    "abstract": "The potential of modified spring barley crops with improved nitrogen (N) use efficiency to reduce nitrogen (N) leaching and to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) storage was assessed at the regional scale. This was done using simulation model applications designed for reporting according to the Helcom (Helsinki Commission) and Kyoto protocols. Using model simulations based on modified crops N dynamics and SOC were assessed for three agro-ecological regions (latitudes ranging 55°20′–60°40′ N) in Sweden over a 20-year period. The modified N use properties of spring barley were implemented in the SOILNDB model (simulating soil C, N, water and heat, and plant N dynamics) by changing the parameters for root N uptake efficiency and plant N demand within a range given by previous model applications to different crops. A doubling of the daily N uptake efficiency and increased N demand (by ca 30%) reduced N leaching by 24%–31%, increased plant N content by 9%–12%, depending on region. The effects of the modified crop on SOC was simulated with the ICBM model, resulting in an increased SOC content (0–25 cm depth) by 57–79 kg C ha−1 y−1. The results suggest that a modified crop might reduce N leaching from spring barley area, in a range similar to the targets of relevant environmental protection directives, a result which held more in the northern than southern regions. The simulated SOC increase on a hectare basis was highest for the central region and least for the most northern region. For the total agricultural area the share of spring barley area was small and more crops would need to be modified to reach the emission reduction targets.",

Procedures: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of fermented crudes extracts of C. myriocarpus fruit when used in fresh form as Nemarioc-AL phytonematicide on management of population densities of root-knot (Meloidogyne species) nematodes and growth of tomato (Solanum lycorpersicum L.) plants. Seedlings at five leaf-stage were transplanted into pots containing 2700 ml steam-pasteurised river sand and Hygromix at 3:1 (v/v) ratio. Each seedling was inoculated with approximately 3000 eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2) at transplanting. The phytonematicide was applied at 0%, 2%, 4%, 8%, 16%, 32% and 64%, arranged in a randomised complete block design, with five replications and validated in time. Results: At 56 days after treatment, nematode variables and phytonematicide concentrations exhibited negative quadratic relations, with coeffients of determination (COD) ranging from 93% to 97%. Similarly, plant variables and phytonematicide concentrations exhibited positive quadratic relations, with COD from 96% to 98%. Conclusions: In conclusion, when prepared from fresh fruit of C. myriocarpus, Nemarioc-AL phytonematicide was suitable for use in managing nematode population densities of Meloidogyne species in tomato production.",

In three of the cultivars the viscosity of water-soluble fibre polysaccharides was analysed as well. Further, the bulking capacity of eight cultivars was evaluated through balance experiments in rats. A decrease of certain dietary fibre components was generally observed after six months' storage. Thus, there was a considerable reduction of unsoluble fibre polysaccharides containing galactose, and in the soluble fraction of galactose and arabinose containing polymers. Simultaneously there was an increase of glucose- (cellulose) and uronic acid- (pectin) based fibres, probably due to losses of components other than dietary fibre, e.g. low molecular weight carbohydrates. This may also explain the apparent higher amount of total fibre, calculated on a dry-weight basis, generally obtained after storage. The proportion of soluble fibre as well as the viscosity of the soluble fibre polysaccharides were only slightly affected by storage. Furthermore, faecal weights and dry matter digestibilities were very similar.",

This method is fast, cheap and well suited for screening of large numbers of seed samples. The technique is based on enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies produced against pea (Pisum sativum L.) proteintype trypsin inhibitors (PPI). The results obtained by ELISA have been compared with results achieved by using traditional enzymatic analyses for determination of both trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor contents, and these methods showed good agreement. Great differences in PPI levels have been found between various pea cultivars grown in Finland and Denmark, and these differences comprised both the total amount of PPI and the relative composition of individual PPI. Several proteins occurring in pea exhibited inhibitor activity, and at least 10 PPI inhibitors with p/ values 4.9–7.8 were detected. Pea cultivars with low PPI levels had a PPI composition different from the PPI composition found in cultivars with high PPI levels.",

Each soil sample was sequentially extracted with anion exchange resin in the HCO3- form, 0.5 M NaHCO3, 0.1 M NaOH and 1.0 M HCI, whereafter the extracted sample was digested with concentrated p.a. 97% H2SO4 to obtain residual P. The size of the P fractions determined did not vary with the P source. However, they did vary depending on soil type, P rate and whether or not cropping was carried out. Cropping markedly decreased resin-P, NaHCo3-inorganic P and HCI-P levels in all the controls, and decreased NaHCO3-organic P in the clay soil control, compared with initial levels. The FP108 and SP108 treatments enhanced levels of resin-P, NaHCO3-inorganic P, NaOH-organic P and HCI-P in all soils, compared with the controls. NaHCO3-organic P was markedly mineralized in the sandy loam soil. Residual P levels declined in the clay soil and accumulated slightly in the remaining three soils. It was concluded that the P fractions were redistributed in the soils and that they were directly or indirectly involved in plant nutrition regardless of P source. In most cases FP maintained labile P pools (∑ resin-P, NaHCO3-P) better than did SP. The fertilizers were similar in their effects on nonlabile P pools (∑ NaOH-P, HCI-P, resid. P).

Nitrogen accumulation in wheat was poorer in conservation tillage treatments and subsequent grain yields were 21-33% lower compared with the cereal crop grown under conventional tillage. Conservation tillage also led to a higher weed emergence during the succeeding growing season. Compared with incorporation of the whole green manuring crop biomass, root incorporation of persian clover and hairy vetch led to a 5% decrease and 3% increase in grain yields, respectively.

Significant daylength effects on dry-matter, total nitrogen, nitrate and soluble protein content in the leaves of plants were demonstrated after only two weeks of treatment. The nitrogen and protein content decreased with increasing daylength, irrespective of the developmental stage of the plants. The dry-matter content increased with daylength when long days had induced generative development and decreased when all treatments at the same harvest were vegetative. The total nitrogen and protein per plant did not decrease from short to long days. The lower nitrogen and protein content in long days can therefore be regarded as a dilution caused by the increased dry-matter production found in these treatments. The observed effects of daylength on the ratio of assimilated nitrogen to assimilated carbon might be direct or indirect, since long days induce both enhanced dry-matter production and generative development in Bodin and Grindstad.

The relative seed yields of ‘Saiten’, ‘Fure’ and ‘Senu Pajbjerg’ were 100, 171 and 175 on average for the first ley year, 100, 126 and 141 on average for the second ley year and 100, 115 and 116 on average for third ley year, respectively. A higher seed yield potential of the predominant Danish cultivar probably explains the commonly reported difference in seed yield between Norway and Denmark. Within Norway, seed yields normally decreased from south to north, with the lowest seed yields produced at Kvithamar and the highest at Staur or Landvik. At the coastal locations Kvithamar and, in particular, Landvik, cutting immediately after seed harvest (stubble removal) was necessary in order to maximize seed yields of ‘Fure’ and ‘Saiten’. Cutting at the end of the growing season (10 October) reduced the winter survival and seed yield of ‘Fure’ and ‘Saiten’ at these locations but was favourable at the inland location Staur, which had more stable snow cover. ‘Senu Pajbjerg’ was especially vulnerable to winter damage and did not benefit from cutting of stubble or regrowth at any location. Compared with inputs later in autumn, nitrogen application immediately after seed harvest increased both DM production in autumn and the next year's seed yield at all Norwegian locations.",

The pollination of organic crops by GM crops has proved contentious and has raised important issues about ways of accommodating different forms of agriculture, and the extent to which it is reasonable for one sector of agriculture to declare zero tolerance of another.

The socio-political climate in which genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are regulated is critically dependent on such events.

    "abstract": "Due to the failure of the existing systems to convert online service reputation evaluation, the accuracy, average recall rate and average comprehensive index of online service reputation evaluation show a straight-line downward trend. Therefore, this paper proposes an online service reputation system of agricultural products sales platform based on P2P network. This paper analyses the related concepts involved in the online service reputation system of agricultural products sales platform, designs the system under P2P network through B/S framework, mainly including the modules of online service reputation evaluation, information release and system account management. The online service reputation evaluation of agricultural products sales platform is transformed into service classification in multi-dimensional space. Machine learning is used to train the samples, and the optimal classifier model is established in multi-dimensional space to classify the online service of agricultural product sales platform, so as to achieve the final evaluation of online service reputation of agricultural product sales platform. The experimental results show that the accuracy and average recall rate of the system are close to 100%, and the average comprehensive index is up to 98.3%.",

    "abstract": "Technology agglomeration effect is the economic effect produced by the spatial concentration of industry and economic activities, and it is one of the key factors to enhance the industrial value chain. In recent years, China's agricultural market has gradually opened up, speeding up the marketisation and commercialisation of agricultural products. However, due to the increasing competition in the Chinese agricultural market, the value chain of the agricultural product industry is facing many challenges. The challenges faced by the value chain of the agricultural product industry are of two types: upstream and downstream. The upstream is the scope to improve yield and scarcity of resources and the downstream includes food chain loss, consumption moving towards F & V and pulses and lack of transparency and traceability. Thus, on the basis of the connotation of the agricultural product industry's value chain and value flow, this article compares and analyses the development status of domestic and foreign industrial value chains, and finally proposes an upgrade path to increase the flow of Chinese agricultural industry's value chain. It is expected to provide a reference for improving the economic benefits of Chinese agricultural product industry's value chain.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different ratios of peat substitution with a locally available hardwood biochar on the chemical characteristics of growing media, seed germination, plant morphological and nutritional parameters of Tagetes patula. Experimental results show that biochar can be used as a partial peat replacement, showing a complementary liming effect, rising the initial pH of peat (2.8) to values of 4.5 and 7.3 in mixtures with 50% and 75% substitution of peat by biochar, respectively. The mixture with a 50% biochar rate exhibited the strongest change between initial and final pH, rising from 4.5 to 5.7. Increasing content of biochar in the mixtures corresponded to increasing content of total K, Ca, Mg, available K and decreasing level of available Mg. The highest germination percentage was observed in the mixtures with biochar rates from 50% to 100%. Among all substrates, the greatest plant diameter, true leaf area and total root length were measured in the 50% peat substitution mixture, where the highest contents of P, K and Ca in plant shoots were found.",

Here, the diversity and the composition of nirK-denitrifying bacterial communities in a double-rice paddy soil were estimated by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing under four fertilisation treatments: no fertilisation (CK), vetch incorporation (CMV), urea (N200) and combined application of vetch and urea (CMV+N100). Compared with CK, N200 increased Shannon index by 10.5% in early rice season, whereas CMV did not change the Shannon index and Chao1 index in both seasons. Proteobacteria and Bradyrhizobium were the most abundant phylum and genus for nirK-denitrifying bacterial communities, respectively. Most variations in abundance of genus components of nirK-denitrifying bacterial communities as affected by the application of urea were detected in late rice season. Principal coordinates analysis showed that effect of CMV on the nirK-denitrifying bacterial communities was weaker than application of inorganic fertiliser (N200 and CMV+N100). Furthermore, redundancy analysis showed that soil was the key factor driving nirK-denitrifying bacterial communities. Our results indicated that the response of the nirK-denitrifying bacterial communities is more sensitive to urea than vetch, suggesting the combination of vetch and urea can be considered as an alternative N resource to inorganic fertiliser.",

Parallel information entropy attribute reduction algorithm can effectively reduce the scale of research data and increase the rate of data preprocessing. The classification assessment and early warning of agrometeorological disasters involve data mining classification prediction technology. Unlike most classification prediction algorithms, KNN classification is particularly suitable for application to meteorological data sets with cross-class domains and can accelerate the classification and prediction speed of big data in the parallel processing architecture. Finally, this paper designs experiments to verify the method proposed in this paper. The results of data analysis show that the model constructed in this paper has a certain effect.",

It was one of the first experiments assessing the natural resistance of sport turfgrass in Europe. In five terms, before and after fertilizers applications, we randomly collected turfgrass samples within each plot for chemical analyses. The turfgrass mixtures did not affect the average contents of salicylic acid and total polyphenols. The average contents of both compounds were influenced by the date of evaluation and fertilization scheme. The average content of salicylic acid was significantly the lowest under fertilization scheme C. The highest level of salicylic acid was detected on 18th June under scheme A and the lowest on 28th May, where the salicylic acid content ranged from 0.01 ± 0.00 mg.g−1 under scheme A to 0.017 ± 0.00 mg.g−1 under scheme B and 0.006±0.00 mg.g−1 under scheme C. The content of total polyphenols was higher under fertilization schemes B and C. We conclude that the method of fertilization exerts a certain effect on the salicylic acid and total polyphenol contents in turfgrass mixtures, which also depends on environmental factors.",

Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) cultivars are highly susceptible to Meloidogyne species, with all cultivars without genotypes with resistance to the genus. In contrast, nematode management options for watermelon production had since the withdrawal of fumigant nematicides been constrained. The objective of this study was to investigate the comparative efficacy of the locally-developed cucurbitacin phytonematicides and commercially available synthetic chemical nematicide Velum on growth and fruit yield and quality of watermelon cv. 'Congo', along with its accumulation of foliar nutrient elements and suppression of M. enterolobii population densities under field conditions. Nemarioc-AL and Nemafric-BL phytonematicides were each applied biweekly at 2% per seedling using 500 ml solution, while Velum was applied once using 500 ml solution at 0.08 ml/15 L chlorine-free water. At 90 days after the treatments, relative to untreated control, the two phytonematicides and Velum (a.i. fluopyram) significantly increased plant growth, fruit yield and quality, although with the accumulation of phosphorus in leaf tissues, with efficacies of the three products being comparable. Similarly, relative to untreated control, the three products significantly reduced nematode eggs and juveniles in roots and juveniles in soil, with efficacies that were significantly comparable. In conclusion, the benefits of phytonematicides on the productivity of watermelon cv. 'Congo' and suppression of population densities of M. enterolobii were comparable.",

(Coleoptera:Scolytidae). Olfactometric studies showed that female beetles were attracted to both tea cultivars TRI2023 and TRI2025 but preferred the susceptible cultivar TRI2025 to the resistant cultivar TRI2023. In a no-choice experiment where the settlement of beetles on twigs of both cultivars was studied, it was found that in the first hour of attack a greater number of beetles attacked twigs of the resistant cultivar TRI2023 than twigs of the susceptible cultivar TRI 2025. However, after the first hour the rate of attack was inverted, i.e. the established view on the resistance of the two clones was registered in terms of attacks. When twigs had been exposed to beetles for 24 h before attack by a fresh set of beetles, a lesser number of beetles attacked the already infested stems of both cultivars consistently throughout the period of observation compared with attack on healthy stems. The possibility of an induced resistance stimulated by the initial beetle attack is suggested and is hypothetically discussed in terms of a plant-resistance strategy based on using a strong initial attack of beetles as a releaser for induced effects which counteract further attacks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A limitation to the increased use of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), a high-yielding perennial grass, is its poor seed retention. Efficient selection of reed canarygrass genotypes could be aided if morphological traits that are associated with agronomic characters such as seed retention could be identified. Folded-leaf progeny plants from a cross involving a seed-retaining clone were observed in a space-planted nursery. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the folded-leaf trait was associated with higher seed retention and other agronomic traits. Under solid-stand conditions, highly significant differences existed between folded- and flat-leaf polycross progeny plots for heading date and seed-retention percentage. The folded-leaf polycross progeny plots had higher seed-retention percentages and later heading dates than did the flat-leaf polycross progeny plots. Under space-planted conditions folded-leaf plants were significantly different from flat-leaf plants for height, panicle length, panicle number, and growth habit. The folded-leaf plants in this nursery were shorter, had a smaller panicle length, possessed more panicles, and were more upright in growth habit than were the flat-leaf plants.",

At two locations, some previous management practices, especially fallow and in some cases N fertilization, resulted in increased yields of subsequent cereal crops. These effects disappeared by the second year of the study. Significant effects were not found at a third site. Soil bulk density, organic carbon (C) and N, and microbial biomass C and N were not affected by previous treatments. Soil wet aggregate stability, pH, and mineralizable C and N were significantly affected in at least one location by previous cropping or N fertilization. Effects of previous management had disappeared or were diminished by the autumn of the year following cessation of the treatment. These results indicate that effects due to past cropping history may be short lived in subarctic agricultural soils.",

The experiment was carried out in sterile and non-sterile soil in order to test the efficacy of biological control in natural soil conditions. This experiment was repeated twice. A Wilcoxon's Signed-Rank test indicated there were no significant (P < 0.05) differences in fusarium wilt control in sterile and non sterile soils in the treatments PL neem and TH neem, but there was significantly (P < 0.05) higher control of M. javanica in the same treatments in sterile soils compared to non sterile soils. The combinations of fungal antagonists and neem were effective in non sterile as in sterile soils in the control of fusarium wilt, while being less effective in the control of M. javanica. Thus the biological control agents can be very effective in the control of fusarium wilt in natural conditions where the soil is not sterilised, but be less effective in the control of M. javanica in the same conditions. There is therefore potential of integrated management of fusarium wilt and root-knot nematodes (RKN) by these biological control agents in natural soil field conditions as an alternative to using chemicals.",

The results showed that support vector machine regression performed better than partial least squares regression for predicting the three chemical compositions.

In sub-Saharan Africa, empirically measured CO2 emissions data from diverse land-use systems is limited. Soil CO2 emission rates were measured in the Limpopo Province, South Africa for 12 months at two-week intervals in natural systems (forest and shrubland) and commercially managed orchards (avocado and citrus) to establish seasonal dynamics of soil CO2 emissions across these land-use systems. The results showed a variation in emission rates with the variation depending on the season. In the spring and winter, soil CO2 emission rates in citrus were four times higher than in the shrubland due to higher moisture levels. However, in the summer season, the forest emission rates were 40% higher than in citrus due to higher soil organic carbon content. Organic carbon stocks were higher in the forest (1.19 kg/m2) compared to the other land uses. This study revealed differences in soil CO2 emission rates among land-use systems, with the cumulative amount of CO2 emitted over a 12-month period following the order: forest (39.3 tons/ha) > citrus (36.1 tons/ha) > shrubland (28.1 tons/ha) > avocado (26.9 tons/ha).

Samples (10 kg dry wt) of a virgin, sandy loam soil and a sandy soil in a rye field were limed with CaCO3 to neutralize 100% of the so-called hydrolytic acidity. They were then moistened to 100% maximum water-holding capacity and incubated for 4 months. During incubation, the soils were leached with 0.5 l deinoized water every week. The leachates were collected and their contents of dissolved substances, C, N, P, Al, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn, were determined. The amounts of dissolved substances and leaching rates of elements investigated varied depending on soil history and liming. The amounts of dissolved substances and leaching losses of N and P were greater in the cultivated soil than in the displaced, virgin soil. C was more susceptible to leaching in the latter soil than in the former. Lime application significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased the solubility of C and P in both soils and solubility of the metals in the virgin soil, whereas it decreased their solubility in the cultivated soil. Hence the liming of acid soils can enhance deficiences of certain nutrients in the soils. Further studies are required to determine whether in the long-term leaching could contribute to the contamination of aquifer under field conditions. Such knowledge is particularly important concerning N and P, which could trigger eutrophication.",

The samples were taken from on-going field experiments, limed to different levels. An analytical procedure, carried out in a single test tube, was developed to cope with the low selenium concentrations in the grain. It involves combined wet/dry ashing of the organic matter, reduction to selenite by hydrochloric acid, complexation to obtain a brominated piazselenol, extraction of the complex into toluene, and finally determination by capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The concentrations of selenium in the grains investigated were low, ranging from 1.5 to 16 ng g−1 dry weight. The limit of detection for a 0.1 g sample is 0.4 ng g−1, as estimated by three times the standard deviation of the blank determination (n = 34) and the absolute limit of detection for pure solutions is below 20 fg (0.5 μl injection on the column). The procedure was validated by determinations on reference materials, testing an alternate digestion procedure, and by determination using hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry. Liming of the soil was found to have a small, but significant negative effect on plant uptake of selenium.",

The yield of dry matter per square metre was virtually constant during the last two weeks of October and the first week of November. The content of nitrate decreased steadily during the harvest period, while the content of dry matter was at a minimum in the middle of October (week 43). The changes in nitrate and dry matter during growth could be explained by results from analyses of the different composition of the fractions of the leek. The content of nitrate and dry matter decreased from the outer to the inner part of the leek, in which the major part of the growth takes place during the weeks up to harvest. A maximum yield of fresh weight and dry matter can be obtained after harvest in October or November (weeks 43–45) when the content of nitrate has decreased to a low and almost stable level.

Crops were sown with a combined sowing and fertilizing machine at five seed rates. The trial plots received nitrogen, 90 kg ha−1. No herbicides were applied. In spring barley sown at a normal seed rate, less than 5% of the nitrogen in the above-ground biomass was accumulated in weeds. In spring wheat stands the corresponding amount averaged 10–15%. The nitrogen concentration in the crop biomass averaged 1.8% of the dry weight and that in mixed weed species 3.2%. Under normal growth conditions the N concentration in crop and weeds was relatively constant at the time of crop heading. Variations in N accumulation between crop plants and weeds are explained by the different biomass production of the plants.",

Experimental studies on compositional changes within CCs are discussed to show how plant breeders can utilize the effects of natural selection. Genetic variability and changes in adaptedness of CCs are surveyed, and thus their significance to breeding populations and genetic conservation. Finally, an ongoing barley population breeding project is presented. The aim of the Nordic project is to form gene pools with a high level of resistance to various barley diseases. During the establishment phase the effects of exotic germplasm on the expression of agricultural traits in adapted barleys is studied.",

In fast start of forcing the temperature was immediately raised to 20°;C for 2 weeks, whereas in slow start of forcing the temperature was kept at 8°;C during the first week, at 13°;C during the second and thereafter at 20°;C. The growing temperature was 17°;C and the photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) was either 100 or 65 w mol m -2 s -1 20 h day -1 . The lower PPF was tested only in fast forcing. Production with a rest period did not reduce the yield compared with year-round production. An interaction between rest period length and forcing rate on yield and quality was observed. Fast forcing at 100 w mol m -2 s -1 PPF resulted in a higher yield than did slow forcing at 100 w mol m -2 s -1 and fast forcing at 65 w mol m -2 s -1 PPF after a 6-week rest period. Plants with 2 weeks' rest, however, gave a higher yield with slow than with fast forcing at both PPF. Irradiance of 65 w mol m -2 s -1 PPF combined with a 6-week rest and slow forcing impaired flower quality. Vase life, when expressed as mean values, did not differ between treatments, but the proportion of cut flowers with a short vase life was higher after 6 than after 2 weeks' storage.

The pea kernels had an average cadmium content of 0.036 ppm. The mean cadmium uptake of the individual pea cultivars did not differ between locations. The cultivar Laser had the highest mean uptake, 0.066 ppm cadmium, while the cultivar Callisto had the lowest uptake, 0.021 ppm cadmium. The highest mean uptake of cadmium was achieved in the field with the second highest level of cadmium (0.39 ppm in soil). The lowest mean uptake of cadmium was obtained in the field with the third highest cadmium content (0.32 ppm). No differences existed between the French and Swedish locations with respect to cadmium uptake in the peas. All cultivars investigated responded in terms of cadmium uptake to the differences in cadmium exposure occurring at the different locations. We suggest that when breeding peas for improved tolerance to cadmium exposure, differences in the genetic material should be carefully investigated and exploited. Our study demonstrates that the cadmium uptake of peas is not dependent on the exact chemical levels of cadmium in soils under such low levels of cadmium as in the present study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pierce's Disease (PD) is a lethal disease of grapevines (Vitis vinifera) caused by a strain of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. At the end of the 1990s, PD spread rapidly in California after accidental introduction of the non-native vector glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca coagulata). The new vector, which prefers citrus as a host for reproduction and overwintering, transmits the bacteria very efficiently to a large variety of plants and is a threat not only to the state's production of grapes, but also to large-scale cultivation of, e.g., almonds and peaches. In order to stop the spread of the new vector and protect the wine industry from PD, quarantine measures have been put into effect and several research projects concerning pest management strategies have been initiated. From a European perspective, interesting results have been achieved by the use of a climate model. This model predicts that cold stress accumulation would exclude PD within wine-producing regions of Europe. However, some reports suggest the existence of cold-tolerant X. fastidiosa PD-causing strains, which could exhibit an invasion potential. Because of global trade and the fact that both the bacterium and the vector are associated with a large number of plant families, other temperate areas such as those in parts of Europe where grape and citrus production dominate are now under threat. The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) has decided to consider H. coagulata a serious threat and is currently asking member countries to pay particular attention to this organism. From experience gained in California, H. coagulata needs to be combated using a palette of measures. Suggested initiatives to prevent introduction to Europe could involve quarantine and/or phytosanitary regulations and consideration of tourist traffic regulation between, for instance, Europe and North America and between Europe and Polynesia. However, current phytosanitary regulatory policies in California indicate that such regulations are not sufficient to prevent outbreaks. Preparation of action plans to be followed in the event of an outbreak should therefore carefully take note of the experience gained so far in deciding which eradication measures should be implemented and at which level of infestation. In the following, the spread of PD is presented and discussed with respect to previous experiences. Knowledge generated within California, such as such use of clay particle sprays and physical barriers and biological control with egg parasitoids, is suggested to be an important tool for European viticulturalists to combat potential outbreaks.",

Five enzyme systems were assessed: glucosephosphate isomerase, leucine aminopeptidase, phosphoglucomutase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase. Alleles descending from the diploid species were found both in natural and artificially produced amphidiploids. No effect of reciprocal crosses was observed. i.e., the Brassica isozymes were under nuclear gene control. Mendelian segregation in the F2 generation from crossing two resynthesized B. napus was observed for the loci glucosephosphate isomerase-2 and phosphoglucomutase-3. Genome-specific alleles were identified for several loci. No alteration in the allelic expression of isozymes was found when assembling all three Brassica genomes in the trigenomic interspecific hybrids. Moreover, trigenomic hybrids were capable of disclosing a silent allele of leucine aminopeptidase from B. carinata, and thus in this study the capability of isozyme analysis for detecting hidden variation was demonstrated.",

Crops sensitive to soil acidity (winter wheat, fodder beet, spring barley and clover-timothy ley) and the less acid-sensitive winter rye, potatoes, oats and lupins and oats mixture were sown in the field trial. In the pot trial, the acid-sensitive spring barley and red clover, and the less acid-sensitive oats and lupin-oats served as the test crops. Combined application of fertilizers (NPK) increased yields of crops sensitive to soil acidity in plots receiving lime by 23%, and those of crops less sensitive to soil acidity by 18% in comparison to crops grown on unlimed soils. The results of pot experiments corroborated the field results. When N was applied alone, crop yields were always higher than those recorded for P or K treatments on both the unlimed and limed treatments. N application proved to be a prerequisite for high crop yields in the soils investigated. Thus, the efficiency of P and K fertilizers increased in the order NK<NP<NPK, with the effects being accentuated more in the limed than in the unlimed treatments. The results demonstrated the importance of multi-nutrient (NPK) fertilization in combination with liming for enhancement of high crop productivity in the unlimed soil investigated. N applied alone in combination with liming produced relatively good yields; hence, where resources are limited for the purchase of P and K fertilizers, applying N and lime can be a viable option in the short term.",

Caenorhabditis elegans was employed to see if ZSPP has anti-aging properties. After medication with ZSPP, the longevity, motility ability, and stress resilience of C. elegans were measured. We studied C. elegans brood growth and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling pathway to learn more about the mechanism of ZSPP's anti-aging action. According to statistical analysis of the experimental results, ZSPP therapy increased the longevity of C. elegans, as well as its motility capacity and stress tolerance. ZSPP was discovered to get a protective effect on UV-irradiated C. elegans in specific and ZSPP had no influence on C. elegans reproduction. However, after ZSPP therapy, the levels of age-1 and hcf-1 mRNA were lowered. In C. elegans, ZSPP has an anti-aging impact via the insulin/IGF signaling system, but it has the potential to evolve into a multifunctional diet in the long term.",

The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of commercial and native nodulation bacteria on productivity of S. frutescens over two seasons. Seasonal interaction on productivity variables was not significant (P < 0.05), with pooled data (n = 75) subjected to analysis of variance. Treatments had a significant effects on plant variables, contributing from 58 to 91% in total treatment variation (TTV) of the variables. Relative to untreated control, commercial strains significantly increased plant variables from 31 to 44%, whereas wild strains increased the variables from 17 to 195%. Similarly, both commercial and native strains significantly increased nitrogen, protein and symbiotic efficiency, with magnitudes of native strains being significantly higher than those of commercial strains. Treatments had no significant effects on K and protein in leaf tissues of S. frutescens. In conclusion, the native strains as investigated in the current study have the potential for use in the husbandry of cancer bush.",

A study was carried out to investigate the medium-term effects of cultural practices on earthworm communities in an agricultural field. Data were collected in the 2018/2019 cropping season from a six-year-old experiment with tillage system, fertiliser application rate and weeding intensity as the main, sub- and sub-subplots, respectively. Lumbricus (34.4%) and Diplocardia (38.3%) were the dominant genera, while endogeic earthworms (48.4%) dominated the community structure among other earthworm functional groups. Clean weeded plots under the basin planting system had higher Lumbricus abundance (quadruple), genus richness (76.4%) and Shannon diversity index (56.0%) than all other treatments. Inorganic fertiliser application in the conventional tillage system reduced Eisenia abundance and genus evenness by 100.0% and 73.3%, respectively. These results suggest that in minimum tillage systems, frequent hand weeding confers positive effects on earthworms including increased abundance. In conventional tillage systems, application of high doses of inorganic fertiliser is detrimental to earthworm communities. Further studies need to focus on identifying the most sustainable and cost-effective hand weeding frequency for enhanced earthworm diversity and increased crop productivity.",

The research on the response to diseases and productivity of field peas was carried out during 2018–2020. The six cultivars and breeding lines were grown at two different infection levels: at natural field infection and under disease control using seed treatment and foliar fungicides. The main disease in field peas during the research year was Ascochyta blight at different intensites depending on year, cultivar/breeding line and disease control efficacy. Dominating pathogenic fungus D. pisi on harvested grains prevailed. Pea grain yield was significantly affected by cultivar/breeding line, experiments year and growing conditions. The highest yield difference between growing conditions (natural field infection and under disease control) was recorded in 2020 when Ascochyta blight and Grey mould gave the most severe attack. This finding illustrates the importance to eliminate one of the most important limiting factors for productivity – severe diseases. Future research on the forecast system of Ascochyta blight and other field pea diseases infection risk is needed. The response of cultivar/breeding line to weather conditions was established in this research as well. Tested breeding lines showed higher drought stress tolerance compared with commercial cultivars. More focus on environment stress-resistant cultivars is needed.",

However, in South Africa the majority of people purchase their staple food, owing to land scarcity. The woven polypropylene plastic bag (WPPB) planting technology, could be a solution for food production in limited spaces. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different sweet potato cultivars on growth performance using the WPPB technology. Compared to the standard ('Blesbok') cultivar, all the tested cultivars ('Bosbok', 'Bophelo', 'Mafutha' and 'Mvuvhelo') had higher chlorophyll content. 'Bophelo' and 'Mvuvhelo' obtained thickest (0.40 and 0.45 cm) stem diameters. 'Mafutha' achieved the highest (64.30 cm) vine length and number of shoots (4.64). Noticeably, 'Mafutha' produced the highest (4.50) number of flowers compared to the standard. 'Bophelo' obtained the highest (122 g) dry shoot mass and 'Bosbok' recorded the highest (11.2) number of enlarged roots (NER). Contrary to that, 'Mafutha' had the lowest (3.4) NER. In conclusion, 'Mafutha' performed well in terms of the above-ground plant parameters, whereas 'Bosbok' was best with regard to the below-ground plant parameters. Therefore, planting 'Bosbok' and 'Mafutha' cultivars in WPPBs achieved the best below and above growth performances, respectively.",

The biochars were applied at the rate of 0.5%, 1% and 2% (w/w) with control (0%) and replicated four times. Chickpeas grown in PLB treatments in Griffin and Pinedene soils investigated accumulated more N and C, for greater biomass production, resulting in an average total N-fixed of 77 and 52 mg N/plant, respectively. Nitrogen fixation and carbon accumulation of chickpea increased by the addition of 0.5% PLB and ACB in the Fernwood soil. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of improving N inputs through biological nitrogen fixation with poultry litter biochar application in soils with varying nutrient status and texture, which is important in arid environments with limited N inputs.",

Therefore, the number of nodules on the roots of 64 accessions of the European common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and the relationship between the number of nodules per accession and other plant characteristics (growth type, earliness, seed yield, and total nitrogen content in seeds) were studied. The results indicated that growth type and earliness influenced the number of nodules per accession (the contributions of principal component analysis were 34.9% for Dim1 and 29.8% for Dim2). The average number of nodules per accession with indeterminate growth type was almost five times higher (20.1) than for accessions with determinate growth type (4.4). Common bean accessions with regular growth cycle length had the highest number of nodules (21.9). In contrast, nodulation efficiency, measured as seed yield per plant and total nitrogen content in seeds, were not correlated with the number of nodules per accession (correlation analysis, r < 0.1). Consequently, data on the nodulation efficiency of European common bean accessions are important for breeding programmes in conjunction with other agronomically important traits for commercial and/or organic cultivation systems.",

NPP was determined under laboratory conditions using a stepwise change in photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) from 0.0 μmol m−2 s−1 to 1.21 × 103 μmol m−2 s−1 at temperatures of 5, 15, 18, 25 and 31°C. NPP was 0.0 mg CO2 gDM−1 h−1 at a PPFD of 1.1 × 102 μmol m−2 s−1 and temperature of 5°C. A PPFD of 1.21 × 103 μmol m−2 s−1 produced 4.44 mg CO2 gDM−1 h−1 at 5°C and 7.15 mg CO2 gDM−1 h−1 at 15°C, but 5.57 mg CO2 gDM−1h−1 at 25°C. Average night respiration was 2.24 mg CO2 gDM−1h−1. The highest average NPP under experimental conditions was 8.56 mg CO2 gDM−1 h−1 with a PPFD of 1.1 × 103 μmol m−2 s−1 at 31°C. An equation was developed for fodder galega to illustrate the relationship between photosynthetic photon flux density and temperature as independent variables and NPP as the dependent variable. The optimum temperatures for NPP of fodder galega were from 12.5 to 32°C in minimum light conditions of 7.26 × 102 μmol m−2 s−1 and a maximum night‐time temperature of 15°C. The potential maximum NPP was about 9 mg CO2 gDM−1 h−1 and occurred at a temperature of 23°C and a PPFD of 1.21 × 103 μmol m−2 s−1 Fodder galega required increased illumination at the beginning of the vegetation period.",

Although significant variation in erucic acid content was found between the 20 B. alboglabra lines, all of them had to be classified as high erucic types. No major erucic acid gene polymorphism was identified. In B. rapa the erucic acid content was regulated by one major gene, which showed partial dominance in three of the four crosses analysed. The high erucic gene seemed to function more efficiently in the Yellow Sarson cytoplasm, resulting in maternal differences when reciprocal crosses were compared. In crosses where modern low erucic acid lines were used as female parents the zero erucic acid F2-individuals occurred more frequently than expected. Segregation of the erucic acid content in crosses involving resynthesized B. napus showed a good fit to a two locus model. No maternal effects were found, but deviations from mid-parent values in the high erucic acid direction occurred in most of the F1-hybrids, indicating partial dominance. Crosses between resynthesized oilseed rape and natural oilseed rape resulted in oleic acid transgressive F5-lines. Key Words: Brassica alboglabra erucic acidoleic acidrecombinant lines",

In addition, two stubble heights, 10 cm and 30 cm, were compared. The aim was to determine the potential of the treatments in weed regulation. The harvests were performed on three occasions: milk-ripeness (I), which is the normal harvest time for a green cereal, yellow-ripeness (II) and binder-ripeness (III). In control plots, harvested at full ripeness, herbicides were used in all years. Weed density initially increased exponentially in all treatments except for the control, but had a tendency to level off after 4 years. In all years weed density was higher when harvest was delayed and the stubble was high. Harvest at milk ripeness (I) favoured short-season annuals such as Stellaria media (L) Vill and worked against late-maturing species such as Polygonum tomentosum (Schrank). Weed density differed between the treatment plots during the last year of the experiment. In the treatment harvested at stage I combined with low stubble height, weed density was only slightly higher than in the control. Thus, when harvesting a green cereal, herbicides can be avoided.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the design and performance of a miniature free air CO 2 enrichment (mini-FACE) system. Two joined concentric rings (a CO 2 fumigation vent-ring and an outer baffle-ring allowing for enhanced local mixing) can be adjusted vertically, allowing the fumigation system to trace canopy development during crop growth. These features facilitate the use of relatively small plots (1.14 m diameter). In tests based on four rings winter wheat was exposed to elevated [CO 2 ]. The system maintained a 1 min average [CO 2 ] at the centre of the control ring within - 10% of the setpoint for 77% of the operation time. In the vertical plane, where the CO 2 is liberated (level 0), the setpoint [CO 2 ] - 20% was met for 77% of the time given as a weighed mean of the ring area (1.02 m 2 ). The variation in [CO 2 ] measured among the four rings was acceptable. This flexible and cheap system may promote increased and globally more widespread research into the effects of increased atmospheric CO 2 on field-grow",

Information was obtained by a direct survey and was processed across Multivariate procedures. Three factors identified three household type strategies, determining the most important organizing forage structures linkage: the presence or the absence of the land factor conditioning the access to both the Useful Agrarian Area and Forage Area, and the structural relationships between the dimension of the live capital and type of labor factor. Since a representative number of households was used in this type of approach, the main combined patterns have been identified and can be considered as strategies since they reflect modes of goal implementation in European fragile lands.",

The results showed that the gross nitrification and mineralization rates significantly increased with the cultivation time in the coastal wetland zone of east China. In native coastal wetland soil, the gross nitrification and mineralization rates were 0.6 and 1.0 mg kg−1d−1, respectively. The gross nitrification and mineralization rates increased up to 5.8 and 4.3 mg kg−1d−1 in the cultivated 60 years soils, respectively. Furthermore, the ratio of gross nitrification to gross mineralization (N/M) and the ratio of nitrification to NH4+ immobilization (N/I) also significantly increased and were >1, suggesting that the increased the risk of N losses from soil through nitrate leaching with the cultivation time. The results of leaching experiment confirmed that the soils with higher gross nitrification rate had a higher nitrate peak concentration in the leachate and the amount of leaching nitrate from soil increased with the increase in gross nitrification rate. The cultivation of coastal wetland soils could increase the nitrogen losses from soil through nitrate leaching, due to gross nitrification rates was significantly stimulated in the cultivated coastal wetland soils, comparing with natural coastal wetland.",

As a relatively hardy species of insect, E. insulana tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions and so is prevalent in many regions of the world. Effect of sex pheromone traps to control spiny bollworm by mass trapping method was studied. Investigation of monthly changes in captures in relation to temperature carried out during 2012 in the Darab region of the Fars Province of Iran. The experiment was carried out in randomised complete blocks design with four treatments and four replications. The treatments used application of the sex pheromone trap at the rates of 16, 20, 24 and 30 traps/ha. The captured male moths were collected and counted every three days. Analysis of the variance of results showed significant differences between time and trap number in the trapping values of E. insulana. Moth populations were observed in the second week of September. The highest and lowest captured insects per hectare were 30 and 16 traps/ha, respectively. The peak captured E. insulana adult males in the sampling period was on 18 November. These results enable forecasting of seasonal E. insulana population peaks, providing additional information vital for the development of a successful, integrated pest-management programme for spiny bollworm.",

The objectives of this study were to clarify the genetic diversity of 44 accessions from different geographical origins using morphological and molecular characteristics and to compare the consistency of these morphological and molecular characteristics. Morphological characteristics showed a large qualitative variability primarily according to fruit-related traits. Twenty-eight random-amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers produced 128 bands. Both morphological characteristics and RAPD markers grouped 44 accessions of C. maxima into four clusters, and the similarity coefficients ranged from 0.70 to 0.91 and from 0.40 to 0.98, respectively. DNA polymorphisms were highly consistent with phenotypic traits on rootstock C. maxima. The relationships between C. maxima from different origins were not clearly defined via morphological characteristics and RAPD analysis, suggesting some traits of C. maxima were specific to geographical location had disappeared or were weak in Heilongjiang province, which would not facilitate pumpkin breeding. Hybrid generations and their parent plants or sister lines were grouped into sub-clusters and showed little genetic distance according to both evaluation methods. Overall, morphological characteristics and RAPD markers were consistent and revealed high genetic diversity between C. maxima landraces from different origins.",

However, during symbiotic development, the details of Nod factor signaling association with the regulation of cell division in nodules are unknown. SymRK, the immediately downstream component of these Nod factor receptors, is central to the Nod factor signaling cascade. In this study, specified RNAi plasmid of GmSymRK was constructed and transformed into soybean roots by agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy root transformation. We found that the nodule number decreased substantially in GmSymRK knockdown soybean transgenic roots. Further to study the relationship between GmFWL1 and Nod factor signaling, we analyzed the GmFWL1 expression levels in the GmSymRK RNAi soybean transgenic roots and found that rhizobia inoculation led to substantially reduced GmFWL1 expression in GmSymRK RNAi soybean transgenic roots. Our studies showed that the regulation of cell division was affected by Nod factor signaling during nodule development in soybean, which provides important information toward understanding the functions of GmSymRK and GmFWL1 in symbiotic signaling and nodule development.",

During this period straw mass decomposition intensity (DIM) was 20.7–29.1%, carbon (C) concentration decreased by 6.5– 22.8%, while an increase occurred in nitrogen (N) 1.1–2.2 times. The highest straw decomposition rate was recorded when after straw incorporation autumn was warm and humid. That year straw mass C to N ratio (C/N) was 38–46. Under less favourable autumn conditions, the highest decomposition of straw was achieved having applied mineral N (with and without Penergetic) and livestock slurry and having incorporated the straw in the soil (C/N = 40–55). A slower decomposition rate was observed for the straw spread on the soil surface with mineral N addition or on undersown red clover.",

At the labelling started after a 4 h photoperiod, two light intensities was included (80 and 170 W m−2). To analyse samples low in 14C, a 14CO2-trapping system interfaced with a Leco high-temperature induction furnace was developed. The 14CO2 was trapped directly in the scintillation vial in 5 mL of liquid Carbosorb, enabling subsequent liquid 14C-scintillation counting to take place without subsampling. The proportion of photosynthate translocated below ground tended to be higher early in the morning than later in the day. Labelling 1.5 h after the onset of light, 19.8 and 7.6% was translocated below ground at late tillering and late elongation, respectively. Corresponding values found at later labellings were 15.4–16.0 and 6.0–6.4%. Higher proportions tended to be translocated below ground when plants were exposed to low light intensity. Exposing plants to low light intensity caused below ground translocation to be 15.4 and 6.0% of the 14C recovered at late tillering and late elongation, respectively, compared with 12.1 and 5.2% after exposure to a higher light intensity. Further experiments are needed to substantiate the observations of this study. The results suggest that the distribution of photoassimilates varies during the daytime and light intensity during the labelling.",

All winters were mild, and winter frost damage did not occur. In one experiment, fibre-cloth covered plants developed more leaves during the autumn and more flowers the following spring. Fibre-cloth increased total yields by about 25% in two out of three experiments. In two experiments, fruit size increased as an effect of fibre-cloth cover. Ripening was accelerated in all three experiments. The overall effect of dark plastic on raised beds was small, increasing total yield in only one year. In a few cases total and soluble dry matter contents of fruits were sligthly increased by fibre-cloth cover or dark plastic on raised beds.

This study, consisting of 19 Finnish and Nordic oat (Avena saTiva L.) genotypes, confirmed this and, in addition, indicated that the most unstable genotypes were characterized by their poor partitioning ability. Correlations between varietal regression coefficients of grain yield and 16 morpho-physiological traits (representing maturity class and plant architecture) indicated that long strawed genotypes with abundant above-ground biomass associated with low HI, were unstable in yield performance. Furthermore, especially late maturing genotypes with a long grain-filling period and high single grain weight tended to suffer most from unfavorable post-anthesis growing conditions. Thus, breeding for genotypes with increased phytomass production, associated with efficient economic sinks, i.e. panicles with high numbers of grains, does not necessarily result in weakened phenotypic stability. The importance of high partitioning ability and sink capacity in producing genotypes with stable yield performance is discussed.",

Rapid grain fill rate was associated with high kernel weight, but not with grain fill duration. Cultivars with longer grain fill duration had higher kernel weights. Selection for shorter grain fill duration would not be effective in reducing GDD to ripe maturity. Environmental conditions that increased grain fill rate also decreased grain fill duration. The superior performance of newly developed, improved cultivars, relative to ‘Olli’, was due to both faster grain fill rate and shorter grain fill duration. We recommend selection for both early ripe maturity and delayed time to heading to develop early-maturing, high-yielding barley cultivars.",

Two sowing rates were used: 30 seeds m−2 (100%) and 36 seeds m−2 (120%). The higher sowing rate decreased the K content in varieties Gloria, Julia, and Lielplatones in 2016. In 2015 the higher sowing rate increased the Ca content while in 2016 the sowing rate decreased the Ca content. The higher sowing rate increased the Mg content in varieties Gloria and Jõgeva in 2016. The highest N, K, and Mg contents were found in variety Gloria. In 2015 the highest K content was found in varieties Gloria and Jõgeva, while in 2016 the highest K content was in variety Lielplatones. The highest Ca content was in variety Bauska. In conclusion, an increased sowing rate did not have a consistent effect on the nutrient content of faba beans. Thus, variety Gloria can be recommended for faba bean production in Northern Europe because it was the variety with the highest nutrient content.",

Forty-two tef genotypes were studied using 33 highly polymorphic SSRs. About 55% of the amplified putative alleles were effective in discriminating the genotypes. The mean PIC value was 0.66, suggesting that the majority of the markers had high discriminatory power. The population structure analysis revealed the presence of two genetically distinct populations and clearly distinguished landraces from the rest. A significant difference in genetic diversity parameters was observed between the two inferred populations. The landraces consistently had higher values for all of the diversity parameters and had contrastingly a higher value of private alleles. The AMOVA showed highly significant (P = 0.001) genetic variation among tef populations and among genotypes, with variance contribution of 17% and 67%, respectively. Eighty-two percent of the Al-toxicity tolerance markers amplified 84 alleles. This finding suggests the possibility of in-situ preservation of rare alleles that may confer acid tolerance through the improvement of available landraces in acid affected soils.

There is some long-term retention of nitrogen applied to soils, but much is lost to runoff, to in situ denitrification and to gaseous forms of nitrogen (such as NH3 and NOX). So it is particularly important to improve nitrogen-use efficiency through various ways. Therefore, the effects of the urea with urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) or/and nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) on the NPP, NH3 and 15N recovery were researched on the alpine grassland ecosystem. The results showed that the addition NBPT to urea can significantly reduce the cumulative NH3 emission of urea-N compared with urea alone. The NBPT or DMPP addition to urea significantly increased the above-ground NPP and the economic efficiency. Urea added to NBPT or NBPT+DMPP could increase the 15N recovery rate of plant and soil (0-40 cm) by nearly 20%. The results indicated that urea combined with DMPP may be a good way to nitrogen fertiliser retention and reduction of NH3 emission for the alpine grassland of the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.",

    "abstract": "In Sweden, drainage and the construction of water infrastructure have influenced agriculture in the last few centuries both positively and negatively. Recently, a trend has set in where wetlands are constructed to retain water, retain and reduce nutrients and to enhance the biodiversity. This study aimed to use remote sensing techniques to study landscape water retention over time. In this pilot study, water retention structures in Gotland (57°28′35.0′′N18°29′ 13.9′′E) and Kalmar Län (56°39′41′′N16°21′46′′E) for 2000/2001 and 2020 were identified and analyzed using Landsat data. In this study, it was found that the number of water retention structures (>0.8 ha) increased from 44 to 101 for Gotland Län and from 44 to 127 for Kalmar Län. Most water retention structures were <4 ha and were located in mid- and downstream areas. A comparison of the remote sensed results with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) database showed a disagreement of the spatial coordinates of the wetlands in the database with the water retention structures. This pilot study has shown that remote sensed data can be used to identify water retention structures, although higher resolution imagery would be highly advisable in these kinds of studies.",

The parameters in the model were heat transmission coefficients, air temperature in the greenhouse and outdoors, irradiance and a single constant for the solar energy efficiency. The energy consumption, screen movements and daily light integral were compared with a glass greenhouse in which the energy screens were controlled by irradiance. In the greenhouse with light-controlled screens the set point for opening and closing of the screens was 5 Wm−2. The energy-saving screens controlled by the energy balance model opened later and closed earlier than in the greenhouse with light-controlled screens. When using the energy balance model the energy saving was 14% for the glass greenhouse and 41% for the double acrylic greenhouse compared with the glass greenhouse with light-controlled screens. The air temperature was on average similar in the three greenhouses, but when the screens were controlled by energy balance the daily light integral was approximately 10% lower and the number of hours the screens were closed was prolonged with 35% for the glass-covered greenhouse and 25% for the double acrylic-covered greenhouse compared with the greenhouse with light-controlled screens. Energy peaks in connection with operation of the screens were not reduced. During the experiment Begonia elatior, Dendranthema grandiflora (Chrysanthemum), Hedera helix, Helianthus annuus, Gerbera jamesonii and Kalanchoë blossfeldiana were grown in the greenhouses. There was a trend in prolongation of the production time when the plants were grown in the glass greenhouse with energy balance control of the screens. A lower number of flowers or inflorescences were observed for some of the plant species produced in the greenhouses with energy balance-controlled screens.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Peanut is one of the most important oilseed crops in the world. Genomic research of cultivated peanut has lagged behind that of other crop species because of the paucity of polymorphic DNA markers found in this crop. Identification of molecular genetic diversity in cultivated peanut will help with effective genetic conservation along with establishing efficient breeding programmes in this crop. The present study was initiated to establish genetic diversity and relationships in the peanut collection in Iran using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Thirteen SSR primer pairs generated 80 alleles among 68 peanut accessions, with an average of 6.15 alleles per locus. Polymorphic information content (PIC)-values were high and ranged from 0.47 (Locus pPGPseq-2C11) to 0.95 (Locus PM183), with a mean value of 0.80. Several accession- and group-specific markers were identified that could be effectively used for identification purposes. High genetic variability was found in the collection. Dice genetic similarity coefficients ranged from 0.08 (D15-A5) to 1 (A8-A10-A12 and E12-E14). A unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) dendrogram and principal-component analysis (PCA) revealed two distinct clusters with three sub-clusters in cluster one that is not group-based on morphological classification of accessions in groups A, B, C, D, and E. Some accessions in the same sub-cluster or group had the same pedigree, but the dendrogram was not fully in accordance with pedigree information. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for five groups as A, B, C, D and E showed a higher level of genetic variation within groups as compared with between groups (83% versus 17%). Results indicated that these previously classified groups do not truly categorize the accessions. Genetic variation detected within the Iranian peanut collection can be utilized for selection of diverse parents for breeding and development of mapping populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) is a dioecious perennial shrub growing on peat land. The berries are a combined fruit with a color ranging from yellow to orange and bright red. Berries are highly valued in the Nordic countries and berries with orange to red color are preferred. Cultivation and breeding has started, and four Norwegian varieties are on the market. These clones were selected on the basis of good shoot production (both sexes), good pollinators (males), and big berries (females). Recently, berry quality has been introduced in breeding programs as a trait for selection. In this study we present the variation in levels of individual anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic derivates between different clones of cloudberry. Both levels of anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic derivates varied considerably between the different clones. The most abundant anthocyanin was cyanidin 3-glucoside, followed by cyanidin 3-rutinoside. One single clone (AN1372) from Andøya in Northern Norway had the highest levels of all the analyzed anthocyanins. Among the two analyzed hydroxycinnamic acids, p-coumaric acid presented the highest ratio in all analyzed berries. Differences between different years were relatively high, but not consistent. Levels of caffeic acid did not vary much between clones. The results indicate a genetic basis for the variation between clones, but since numbers of samples were few and sampling only were done during two growth seasons, further analysis will be needed to examine the variation and genetic basis of anthocyanin composition of cloudberry.",

In five trials in which the fly infestation was high, 10–100% of the roots were damaged and marketable yield was reduced by 30–100%. Satisfactory control was achieved by drenching the crop with the organophosphorous insecticides diazinon or fenthion, timed according to catch on traps. Seed coating (isofenphos) had an unreliable, often lacking, effect. Residue levels of the fenthion in the carrots at harvest were unacceptable, even when this insecticide was applied at the recommended rates.",

In the Danish cultivar ‘Sylvia’ 40% of the plants developed elongated seed‐stalks after being raised for 6 weeks in a greenhouse, chilled (5°C) for 8 weeks, and thereafter grown in a greenhouse for 3 weeks and 5 days in the field. Plants with 5–6 leaves were the most sensitive to chilling, but plants with only two leaves also responded to the cold stimuli and they developed elongated seed‐stalks. Seeds from annual plants of a wild caraway gave plants that were more easily vernalized at 10°C than ‘Sylvia’, while the results were the opposite at 5°C. In two years about 50% of non‐chilled plants of ‘Sylvia’, raised for 8 weeks in a greenhouse and transplanted to the field in late May, produced elongated seed‐stalks in the same season. It is concluded that the tested caraway genotypes are not typical biennial plants which demand a long winter period to be vernalized. The results show a great diversity in demand for chilling in ‘Sylvia’ and in a Norwegian selection of wild caraway.",

The volume absorptions and transpiration rates were significantly higher for NS than for ST plants and decreased almost linearly with time for all treatments. The transpiration rates of Ca‐feeding ST plants and the control overlapped, while the NS plants approached the same rate of transpiration by the third week only. It is suggested that Ca was implicated in stomatal closure for the reduction of transpiration rates. The relative amounts of chlorophyll decreased with time but chlorophyll was least affected in Ca‐absorbing plants for both ST and NS plants. The use of RR (a Ca‐transport blocker) and EGTA (a Ca chelator) indicated the role of intracellular Ca concentrations on stomatal closure and foliar senescence at the end of the season.

The highest conidial record, 47 conida per m3 air, was observed inside the carrot plot, during 1 h in September 1985 at one location. Only one or two conida were trapped on most of the other days.

Herbicide treatment caused reduced DM yields in one of two experimental years, and P. pratense showed the greatest reduction. During one of the years, water soluble carbohydrate content decreased, whereas crude protein and fibre fractions increased following herbicide treatment. As a result of the very dry growth conditions and high rates of herbicides, high amounts of herbicide residues were found in both years. With the exception of P. pratense it should not be necessary to take the effects of MCPA and dichlorprop on yield and forage quality into account during dry growth conditions. However, dry conditions will probably result in high levels of herbicide residues in the forage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The mineral topsoil in 52 sites with different soil type under natural forests of Quercus petraea was studied in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. As a result of the anthropogenic influence, most of these forests are situated where the topography complicates their harvesting. The substrates are siliceous and the soils are mainly regosols. These soils are more frugal than soils under other oaks (Q. robur and Q. pyrenaica) that occupy the largest surface in the zone. The chemical properties were similar to those reported as the optimal for oak forests in the study area: pH very homogeneous, giving rise to typically acidic soils, disabling desirable conditions for humification, as verified by C/N ratio values and the presence of moder type humus. Although the base cations can be considered as high compared with Q. robur soils (except for copper), the phosphorus in the topsoil was clearly less (12.6 versus 21.8 ppm), indicating that these are mature forests that have not undergone changes in land use. Significant differences between soil types, chemical composition (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and zinc) and topsoil fertility were observed. In the same way, the analysis of site conditions showed the existence of statistical differences with pH, zinc, C/N ratio, magnesium and copper content. The ecologic variables with the highest number of significant relationships with the topsoil parameters were altitude, annual precipitation and annual mean temperature.",

A fixed nitrogen level (120 kg N ha−1) was used, giving four fertiliser treatments. Eleven experiments were carried out the years 1992–1994, with latitudes 55° 55′ N as southern and 59° 36′ N as northern limit. Fertiliser-use efficiency, defined as grain yield, or grain nitrogen yield, per unit of applied N, was strongly affected by the treatments: values for combi-drilled were higher than for broadcast fertiliser and higher for NP than for CAN, with the effects being additive. The best treatment, using both banding and NP, resulted, as a mean of all trials, in a grain yield increase of 939 kg ha−1 at 15% moisture content, or a nitrogen yield increase of 18 kg nitrogen ha−1 compared with the poorest, using broadcast CAN. The N combi-drill effect was expected to be dependent on water availability, but this could not be confirmed when accumulated rainfall during crop establishment was used as test variable. The combi-drill effect was strongest in places where major extractable cations were abundant, possible explanations for this are discussed. Application of P to the crop and the use of combi-drill are recommended for malting barley fertilisation in Sweden.",

Significantly higher yield parameters such as fruit weight, number of drupelets, and productivity were observed from the hybrid cultivars 'Astra' + 'Aura'.

Fruit of this plant contain high vitamin C and the tree is being researched and bred for arid inland southern Africa regions. Climate change predictions suggested that by 2030 the regions would experience high temperatures (>45°C), recurrent floods and repeated droughts, which are associated with increased salinity challenges. The objective of this study was to determine the degree of salt tolerance in M. zeyheri seedlings to chloride and carbonate salinity during summer and winter shoot flushes under microplot conditions. Treatments, comprising untreated control, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 and Na2CO3 each at 1.0 molar (M) solutions, were applied weekly for eight weeks. During both seasons, CaCl2 and Na2CO3 salinity had significant effects on soil pH and EC. During summer, salt types increased (106%–253%) dry shoot mass and reduced (53%–79%) root/shoot ratio. During winter, Na2CO3 salinity increased (114%) dry shoot mass, but the effects were not different to those induced by NaCl and CaCl2 salinity. All other plant growth variables were not affected by salt type. Salt type had significant effects on assimilation of selected nutrient elements in leaf tissues of M. zeyheri seedlings during winter. Sodium chloride did not have significant effects on nutrient elements, whereas KCl, CaCl2 and Na2CO3 significantly affected selected macronutrient elements and Zn. In conclusion, effects of chloride and carbonate salinity on M. zeyheri seedlings were both season- and salt type-specific, with seedlings displaying some degree of salt tolerance to chloride and carbonate salinity.",

The migration and colonisation dynamics of the two fluorescent tagged rhizobia strains were monitored using UV lamp detection and a stereo fluorescence microscopy.Results: The results showed that both rhizobia strains mainly colonised the roots and could migrate to aerial tissues. In aerial tissues, when alfalfa plants were inoculated during the bud stage, both rhizobia strains mainly colonised the leaves and stems; during the flower stage, a spray inoculation treatment resulted in more 12531f colonising reproductive tissues, while during the pod stage, more rhizobial strains gn5f colonised seeds using the root drench with matrine treatment.Conclusions: These results indicate that endophytic rhizobia are natural inhabitants of internal regions of roots, stems, leaves and that the endophytes may arise from reproductive tissues, such as seeds. Understanding the population dynamics of endophytic rhizobia in alfalfa would considerably improve the survival of target rhizobia during seed transfer. Combining target endogenous rhizobial species with good alfalfa seed varieties may lead to the development of a novel breeding method.",

Here, we investigated the change in HWOC in the topsoil of different ecosystems in the southern part of the Loess Plateau in the semiarid region of China and compared it with that in other regions. The HWOC concentrations of the study area (0-10 cm) were 0.27 ± 0.12 g C kg−1 and 0.19 ± 0.04 g C kg−1 in the natural and agricultural systems respectively, and the HWOC proportions were 1.38 ± 0.38% and 2.18 ± 0.22%. The HWOC concentration and proportion in the study area were much lower than the reported data in other areas, which may be affected by drought conditions. Irrigation could weaken the difference in HWOC between agricultural systems in different regions. Since HWOC is easily lost due to the impact of the arid climate, the soil carbon balance and carbon sequestration in arid and semiarid areas are relatively unstable, indicating that soil management should be improved in combination with water management.",

It being an undertilised crop, its production is usually relegated to poor sandy soils that are highly prone to root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species). Commonly communal producers of tepary beans use retained seeds with no knowledge of the nematode resistance status of the seeds. Hence the objective of the study was to determine whether Meloidogyne entorolobii will be able to reproduce on the Kickapoo white tepary bean and cause a reduction in the plant's growth variables. To achieve this objective, Kickapoo white tepary bean seedlings were exposed to 0, 25, 50, 125, 250, 625, 1250 and 3125 M. entorolobii eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2) in 2021 and validated in 2022 under shade-net conditions. At 56 days after inoculation, plant and nematode variables were collected and reproductive factor (Rf) was computed. Plant growth variables were not reduced whereas, nematode variables increased with an increase in nematode levels. In both experiments the Rf values were above a unity for all inoculation levels, indicating that nematodes were able to reproduce.. In conclusion, Kickapoo white tepary bean is tolerant to M. entorolobii.",

Challenges with inoculation by Rhizobium meliloti have been identified as a bottleneck to adaptation.

During a one-year outdoor pot experiment, we tested the impact of IS (wet peat slurry and Nitragin Gold dry inoculation) and three soil types (sand, sandy silt and /peat soil) on nodule development, shoot and root growth and winter survival of one hybrid lucerne cultivar (‘Ludvig’). The pot experiment revealed that dry inoculation led to significant better plant growth, flower and nodule development as well as plant regrowth after winter survival. Peat soil appeared as the best growth medium and silty soil limited inoculation efficiencies. In field trials at two locations differing in soil characteristics using similar ISs, and three hybrid lucerne cultivars (‘Lavo’, ‘Live’ and ‘Lotte’) biomass yield during two ley years showed site as well as cultivar differences. Such environmental interactions in the field trials justify the use of adapted cultivars, and dry inoculation should be recommended for practical use replacing peat slurry inoculation.",

In this research, the effects of high-pressure vapour sodium lamps (HPS) are compared to light emitting diodes (LED), both with similar photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa cv. ‘Sonata' and cv. ‘Magnum') were grown either under HPS lights or LEDs and 16°C/8°C (day/night). However, in the second winter, the day temperature was increased to 19°C under LEDs. The results showed that under the same temperature set points, the development of the flowers and the harvest was delayed by two weeks under LEDs due to a lower leaf, substrate and air temperature. However, when temperature set points were adapted, no delay under LEDs was observed. LEDs did not lead to higher yield, but to a higher energy use efficiency, while light use efficiency behaved contrary. Economic calculations clearly demonstrate that it is not justified to switch from HPS lights to LEDs. Instead, it is rather recommended to emphasise a high-yielding variety like Sonata in winter-growing of strawberries.",

    "abstract": "Adapting agriculture to climate change is essential for sustainable food production. However, the development of suitable adaptation mechanisms requires a clear understanding of the plant-climate interaction. The number of growing degree days (GDD) is a good proxy for understanding plant-climate interrelationship and farm productivity. Here, using a 2-year experiment of barley-sweet corn double cropping (DC) system and 20-year climate and yield data, we found that barley and sweet corn GDD and productivity were strongly related to changes in climate patterns. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of the barley-sweet corn DC system on farm productivity (18.5 and 5.6 tonnes. ha−1 for DC and single cropping respectively) and return on investment (1.8; 1.4 as benefit:cost ratios for DC and single cropping system respectively). Altogether the results of this study suggest that the winter barley-sweet corn double cropping system is a potential strategy to boost farm productivity as well as an adaptation mechanism to be considered for the changing climate in the study region.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale import of soybean products into the EU decreases the self-sufficiency of livestock production. The fractionation of grassland forage crops presents an opportunity to locally produce protein-rich feed for monogastrics. Two promising fractionation methods, twin-screw press juicing and leaf stripping, were evaluated in parallel in field experiments established in Norway and Sweden to compare the nutrient composition and yield of the resulting biorefined and residual fractions. The clearest delineation between the methods was in the ash-free neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom) concentration, with juicing producing a biorefined fraction with a lower aNDFom than leaf stripping. Variability in the allocation of crude protein (CP) and biomass to the biorefined fractions occurred in both methods between cuts and locations and is likely due to differing stand characteristics and inconsistency in machine functionality. Additional work is needed to understand how characteristics such as stand density, botanical composition, and plant phenological stage impact each fractionation method’s ability to allocate protein, fibre, and biomass into the resulting fractions. Future studies should focus particularly on determining standardised settings for leaf stripping machinery based on a range of stand characteristics to ensure consistency in the yield and nutrient composition of the resulting fractions.",

In addition to the conventional Freundlich adsorption isotherms, calculated separately for each soil, extended Freundlich-type isotherms that also incorporate soil pH and other soil characteristics were used to describe Zn adsorption of several soils simultaneously in one equation.

Seed from 23 different genotypes and seed lots was germinated in various phytotron chambers during the winters of 1986 and 1990. At 21°C constant temperature, dormancy was evident even after seven years of storage in a dry room at 0–10°C. By contrast, alternating temperatures (21/12°C) elicited 80–100% germination of viable seed of nearly all genotypes and seed lots. Light treatment had no impact on germination after 28 days at 21/12°C, but continuous darkness and continuous fluorescent light were both inferior to 8 h light/16 h dark illumination cycles at 21°C constant temperature. Seed of the commercial cultivar Lavang produced in Southern Norway developed the same long-term, temperature-dependent dormancy as seed produced in Northern Norway.

Within an inflorescence, ripening was delayed and dry matter concentration decreased in the smaller fruits, while acids increased. Among fully ripe fruits the smaller fruits attained lower dry matter concentrations, fewer achenes per fruit and a higher density of achenes. Dry matter concentrations were enhanced at the later pickings where the average fruit size declined. Smaller plants, as affected by plant material or planting time the year before, by plant age or by nitrogen supply, often developed higher dry matter concentrations in fruits. Drought during fruit development resulted in smaller fruits and higher achene density and dry matter concentrations. It is concluded that, with the exception of the effects of drought during fruit development, effects on fruit composition, which often are relatively small, more likely are connected to effects on flower development than on fruit growth proper.

    "abstract": "Abstract Field trials comparing various combinations of 0, 30 or 60 kg N ha−1 in autumn (September) and/or spring (April) to seed crops of common bent (syn. browntop, US: colonial bentgrass, Agrostis capillaris L.) ‘Leikvin’ (main use: long-lasting pastures and utility turf) and ‘Nor’ (main use: lawns and golf course fairways) were carried out on silt loam soils at Landvik, south-east Norway (58°N) from 1989 to 1994. One trial per cultivar was established in 1989, 1990 and 1991, each trial being harvested for three years. On average, for nine harvests and nine N treatments, ‘Leikvin’ and ‘Nor’ gave seed yields of 276 and 128 kg ha-1, respectively. Seed yields of ‘Leikvin’ increased with increasing N rate up to 60 kg N ha−1 in autumn and 30 kg N ha−1 in spring; no interaction between autumn and spring N rate could be detected in this cultivar. In ‘Nor’, a significant autumn x spring rate interaction indicated a linear seed yield response to N in spring on plots that had received 60 kg N ha−1 in autumn, but a diminishing response to N in spring on plots that had received 0 or 30 kg N ha-1 in autumn; the highest seed yield was produced with autumn + spring applications of 60 + 60 kg N ha−1 in this lawn cultivar. While panicle number and seed number per panicle were equally important for seed yield in ‘Leikvin’, panicle number had the stronger impact on seed yield in'Nor'. Seed crops of ‘Leikvin’ were generally taller and more susceptible to lodging than seed crops of ‘Nor’. Year-to-year variations in seed yield level and optimal N regime were less related to crop age than to weather conditions and seed crop management. Given the present prices for fertilizer and seed, it is concluded that Norwegian seed crops of common bent should receive 50–60 kg N ha−1 in autumn regardless of cultivar. Economically optimal N rates in spring are 30 and 60 kg N ha−1 to ‘Leikvin’ and ‘Nor’, respectively.",

However, nitrate reduction is usually accompanied with an increase in N2O emission. This study was conducted to reduce N2O emission in a nitrate-rich vegetable soil flooded for remediation and amended with biochar. Nitrate-rich vegetable soil was placed in five treatment groups: flooding (F); flooding with rice straw (F + RS); flooding with rice straw and 1% biochar (F + RS + 1% biochar); flooding with rice straw and 3% biochar (F + RS + 3% biochar); flooding with rice straw and CaO (F + RS + CaO). Biochar and CaO reduced the N2O emission levels relative to the F + RS group, with the former being more effective than the latter, achieving reduction of 40.70% (3% biochar) and 17.35% (CaO) of cumulative N2O emission. The 3% biochar was more effective than the 1% biochar. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation between the abundance of NO reductase gene (norB) and soil N2O emission flux. In general, biochar and CaO could effectively reduce N2O emissions from a nitrate-rich vegetable soil during flooding remediation, duo to elevating soil pH and altering denitrifying activity. The norB gene was the most important denitrifying gene driving soil N2O emission in the remediation.",

Thus, this study was aimed to investigate the effect of N application on glucosinolates and phenolic acids, at harvest, in varieties ‘Largardo’, ‘Eskimo’ and ‘CF-744’ grown in the field. N was applied as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) at concentrations from 0, 60, 90, 120, 150 to 180 kg ha−1. Variety ‘CF-744’ was more sensitive to N supply and at 180 kg ha−1 N it showed the highest accumulation of glucosinolates (sinigrin, glucoiberin, progoitrin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin) at harvest. However, 90 kg ha−1 N supply demonstrated the highest accumulation of majority of the glucosinolates in varieties ‘Largardo’ and ‘Eskimo’. Different varieties responded differently to N supply and glucosinolate levels in cauliflowers. Also, different varieties responded differently to N supply and antioxidant property. In all three varieties, the N supply at 120 kg ha−1 showed the highest accumulation of protocatechoic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and caffeic acid.",

    "abstract": "Regardless of variable environmental conditions and changing pathogen populations, the Estonian potato cultivar (cv.) Ando has shown elevated field resistance to Phytophthora infestans for over 40 years. One of cv. Ando’s parents, the Latvian cultivar Agra, is considered a cultivar of medium to low resistance, the other parent, line 382-48, has a well-known source of resistance, Solanum demissum, in its pedigree. Segregation of late blight disease severity in a population of 95 hybrid plants from cv. Ando’s backcross to cv. Agra (cv. Ando x cv. Agra BC1) in field trials of three consecutive years (2013−2015) and in a test of a single pathogen isolate fits a model of additive action of multiple unlinked race-specific resistance genes responsible for the field resistance of cv. Ando. At least some of the resistance genes in cv. Ando’s genome do not function in juvenile plants and are developmentally upregulated.",

    "abstract": "In the future, increased precipitation in spring may force Scandinavian farmers to prepare their cereal seedbeds under conditions with excessive soil moisture, and thereby risk soil compaction, oxygen deficiency and yield loss. To adapt to climate change and avoid yield loss, a possible strategy may be to increase moisture loss from the seedbed, in contrast to earlier seedbed research, which has focused on minimising moisture loss. In this study, we compared light and heavy mechanisation alternatives for secondary tillage in an experiment with relatively dry and excess moisture conditions. The mechanisation alternatives’ suitability for excess moisture conditions was assessed in terms of resultant aggregate size distribution, penetration resistance, bulk density, air-filled porosity, air permeability, soil moisture content and cereal emergence. In general, lighter mechanisation created more favourable seedbed characteristics and seemed to be more suitable under excess soil moisture conditions. Larger aggregates after heavier mechanisation did not result in lower soil moisture content, probably because of compaction in the seedbed. We conclude that, under Norwegian conditions, the most important adaptation to climate change in seedbed preparation for spring cereals is the avoidance of compaction. Implement management for seedbed preparation should be more differentiated.",

The objective of this study was to use the CARD model in the determination of M. incognita sensitivity, density-dependent growth (DDG) patterns and minimum inhibition concentrations of M. angolensis and T. elegans plant extracts on juvenile hatch and mortality. The CARD model quantified concentration ranges of the two plant extracts that could stimulate (Dm − Rh), saturate (Rh − D0) and inhibit (D0 − D100), J2 hatch and mortality. Meloidogyne incognita J2 hatch was moderately sensitive to M. angolensis and T. elegans plant extracts with average sensitivity ranking of 20 and 19 units, respectively. J2 mortalities were moderately sensitive to T. elegans average sensitivity ranking of 15 units, whereas highly sensitive to M. angolensis at 2 units. The minimum juvenile hatch inhibition and lethal concentrations for the two extracts were comparable and very low at 0.07, 0.06 and 0.13, 094 mg mL−1, respectively. In conclusion, the low minimum concentrations for M. incognita J2 hatch inhibition and lethal concentrations of M. angolensis and T. elegans plant extracts and moderate sensitivity values provide substantial evidence of high potency of the two extracts in the potential management of M. incognita.",

Procedures: 20 sweet potato lines were screened against M. javanica, M. incognita race 2 and M. incognita race 4 in parallel trials inoculated with 3000 eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2) per established cutting. Results: At 56 days after inoculation, the reproductive potential (RP) of all test Meloidogyne species on sweet potato line 1990-10-2 was zero, whereas RP values on other lines were 19.48–342.7, 31.9–995.1 and 10.3–380.44 ranges for M. javanica, M. incognita race 2 and M. incognita race 4, respectively. Conclusion: Among the test sweet potato lines, line 1990-10-2 was non-host to populations of tropical Meloidogyne species in South Africa and could, therefore, be subjected to nematode resistance tests.",

Two factors were examined: factor I − post-harvest residues of field pea 100% − pure stand, oat 100% − pure stand, field pea 75% + oat 25%, field pea 50% + oat 50%, field pea 25% + oat 75%; factor II − forecrop harvest date: the stage of field pea flowering, the stage of field pea flat green pod. The obtained results demonstrated that the lowest mineral nitrogen content in two soil layers was recorded following oat harvested at the stage of field pea flat green pod.

This study assessed the effect of the relative planting dates of legumes on yield and yield components of three legume species. Field experiments were conducted in two consecutive years at two sites with contrasting soil types. Grain yield and yield components were determined at harvest maturity. A 4-weeks delay in incorporating legumes caused total yield loss of cowpea at both sites, decreased chickpea yield by 82% at the clay soil site, and led to negligible yield of Bambara groundnut in loamy sand soil. In contrast, sowing legumes 2 weeks after cassava decreased grain yield of cowpea (both sites), chickpea (clay soil) and Bambara groundnut (loamy sand soil). Intercropping decreased grain yield of chickpea (year 1) and Bambara (year 2) at the clay and loamy sand soil sites, respectively, but had no effect on cowpea yield. Although planting the legumes same time with cassava gave the highest grain yield, we suggest more studies, including sowing the legumes prior to planting cassava, before making categorical recommendations.",

Using an optical sensor (hourly data storage), a Swedish field with vermiculite clay was monitored for water flow (Q expressed in mm), turbidity values (TURB), and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations (CNO3N, mg L-1) in four hydrological years representing different cropping/soil management regimes. Mean TURB-Q slope (1300) decreased in the order: ploughed soil > winter wheat > unfertilized fallow > winter wheat after drainage system renovation + structure-liming of topsoil and backfill, estimated in the initial phase from 16 selected autumn events. A similar ranking was found for variability in turbidity relative to that in discharge (CVT/CVQ) in the entire autumn. Mean CNO3N-Q slope (=2) was significantly lower under fallow than in the three cropping systems (7-32), confirming results from adjacent experimental plots. A spring-period had no snow cover or intensive rain, but in situ monitoring revealed that nutrient leaching was still substantial. Particulate- and dissolved reactive phosphorus, and nitrate-nitrogen leaching was estimated reasonably well (less than 8% difference) based on in situ high-frequency resolution measurements, compared with laboratory analysis of weekly composite samples. Accurate assessment of C-Q relationships in agricultural drainage water across temporal and spatial scales is therefore important.",

This study develops a simplified method for determining soil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and Green-Ampt wetting front suction ψ. Field Philip-Dunne infiltration tests are performed in a loam soil under different initial head heights (30, 40, and 50 cm) at 45 test points. The relationship between infiltration time ti and the parameters ks and ψ is explored. The results show that Δθ within the range of 0.015–0.147 has little influence on ks or ψ in the test soil, and prediction of the two parameters using mean Δθ meets the accuracy requirements. ks is significantly negatively correlated with ti and best predicted by 1/tmed; the prediction accuracy of the linear function is strongly influenced by the initial head height h0. There is a significant relationship between ψ and tmax/tmed, and h0 has little influence on the prediction accuracy of the power function. Therefore, the simplified models based on 1/tmed and tmax/tmed can be used for field-scale determination of the parameters ks and ψ in loam soil, with an overall error below 10%.",

By contrast, polygenic and more broadly based resistant varieties will maintain their resistance for longer, and often synergise beneficially with biological control. The pests also become more susceptible to insecticides, giving the opportunity for applications which are selective in favour of natural enemies.

Use the employment coefficient to further analyze the impact of US crop exports on the employment of its own industry and other industries and the impact of exports from other industries on employment in the crop industry. We found: (1) The value-added of the service industry included in the export of the US crop industry is higher than that of the manufacturing industry and the primary industry. (2) Among the exports of other industries, the crop industry included in the manufacturing export has the most value-added and continues to increase, while the value added of the service industry and the primary industry is low. (3) The number of employed people in the industry driven by the export of the US crop industry is increasing. Among the other industries, the service industry has the largest number of employed people driven by the export of the crop industry.",

The effects were compared on decay, juice optical density, titratable acidity, pH, soluble solids content and firmness. CA treatment has a great potential for sour cherry storage in maintaining quality and in extending the length of the storage period. The study has indicated that the decay of sour cherry can be greatly reduced by 25% CO2. High CO2 concentration gave the best retention of red colour and titratable acidity throughout the storage period. Fruit juice optical density and firmness increased with storage time. Fruits stored in 25% CO2+10% O2 had higher soluble solids content compared with fruits stored in air.",

This study was conducted to determine the inheritance of grain fill rate and its relationship to other agronomic traits. Thirty‐three doubled haploid lines and parents from two crosses were evaluated for three years at Palmer, Alaska. The distribution of lines for grain fill rate in the progenies was approximately normal. Heritability of grain fill rate was 89.6% in one cross and 90.0% in the other. Rapid grain fill rate was associated with shorter effective grain fill period, longer time to heading, and higher grain yield, but not with time to maturity. Rapid grain fill rate appears to provide a means of improving grain yield without increasing time to maturity.",

With so many countries declaring the state of the emergency protocol due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, adopting and intensifying the provisions for the fourth industrial revolution technologies such as robotics and state-of-the-art mobile laboratories could be the only way to transform and expedite the approach to soil assessment, mapping, monitoring, and environmental management. This article proposes the fourth industrial revolution methodologies that can be adapted to assist the farmers and community in managing soils and the environment when the world nations are in a predicament of the pandemic such as COVID-19. The task would be to develop an outdoor automated or semi-autonomous machine vision system (drone or a robot) that can exceptionally substitute human labour on soil management tasks that are critical and cannot be performed by human labour as a result of COVID-19 national lockdown and any other related limitations of infield conventional assessment methods.",

    "abstract": "The Pacific Alliance is an economic and development initiative where four Latin American nations: Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, seek the growth in the economics of the four nations. It is in this way that agriculture plays an important role in this union since it is one of the greatest sources of income in each nation. However, the internal conflict that afflicts each country generates stagnation in economic growth, affecting its exports. Forced displacement is one of the main consequences of the internal conflict within the countries that make up the Pacific Alliance. Therefore, a model of Population Dynamics System P (PDP System) is proposed, viewing this phenomenon as a classic predator-prey model, where one ‘predator’ resources that in this case are the territories, and in this struggle one species predominates over the other. The simulations showed how the populations are being affected and how the analogy between the social conflict described above and the Lokta-Volterra model can be modelled with a topic that has always been considered to be social. Although much more complex scenarios can be simulated by adding other variables, this study is an approach that yields important results that can be considered in other studies",

In this paper, seed germination feature responses in saline-alkali conditions were tested. H. ammodendron seeds retained 72% of germination percentage (GP) under high salinity up to 500 mmol L−1 saline solution and other germination parameters showed a significant decrease under increasing salinity without alkaline stress (P < 0.05). GP of N. roborowskii Kom was significantly accelerated from 0 to 200 mmol L−1 saline solution (P < 0.05), while other germination parameters were significantly accelerated from 0 to 100 mmol L−1 saline solution without alkaline stress (P < 0.05). Germination parameters of H. ammodendron under low concentration (concentration < 300 mmol L−1) alkali stress (pH < 8.78) were accelerated than non-alkali stress. Germination parameters of N. roborowskii Kom seeds were significantly inhibited under alkali stress (P < 0.05); moreover, the facilitation of low salinity was diminished by alkali stress (P < 0.05). The regression models of germination parameters and salinity under different pH values presented cubic curves, quadratic curves, and linear model and all models were significant (P < 0.05) in both plants.",

A moving average is a statistical estimation that is used to evaluate sets of data by comparing the amounts of various subsets of the entire data set. Simultaneously, this paper improves the traditional reel structure and adds image recognition equipment to recognise crop lodging in real time during harvesting. In addition, this paper reasonably controls the reel system for harvesting, sets the reel working status by identifying lodging crops, and combines image technology to achieve efficient operation of the reel system.

The polymorphic information content (PIC) of the SSR markers ranged from 0.15 to 0.84 with a mean of 0.57 showing moderate discriminatory power of the primers. The neighbour-joining clustering algorithm classified the genotypes into three main groups, revealing narrow to moderate variations existing among the test genotypes. Overall, the genetic diversity revealed by the study will be useful for designed crosses and pyramiding of broad-based resistance genes to control Striga for sustainable sorghum production.",

This article takes five major corn production areas as an example, uses data envelopment analysis to measure the cost efficiency and makes an empirical analysis of the impact of human capital on cost efficiency and its action path by using bidirectional fixed-effect model. It is found that the impact of educational human capital on cost efficiency presents a positive 'U' shape, and there are differences among different regions through technical efficiency and allocation efficiency paths. Healthy human capital has a significant positive impact on cost efficiency, but with the increase of the number, its role will gradually weaken, except for the southwest region, and its impact path is allocation efficiency. The impact of technical human capital on cost efficiency shows a positive 'U' type change, and the change of each production area is roughly the same as the whole. Its impact on cost efficiency is mainly realised through allocation efficiency. This article provides a theoretical basis for different policy measures to better play the role of human capital in improving cost efficiency in China.",

There is a certain degree of conflict between ecological environment protection and trade facilitation and liberalisation, but they are not completely uncoordinated. Therefore, the establishment of a set of coordination mechanisms that can restrain and encourage countries to carry out international cooperation plays a key role in resolving the conflict between the two.

The results show that: (1) The hawkish tendency in the presidents' attitudes has a certain relationship with North Korea's grain production. However, dove tendency is related to grain yield and its fluctuation rate, and the impact of the rate on the dove stance is even greater than the impact of production. (2) When North Korea's grain production increases, the presidents' stance on North Korea's policy tends to be tough; but when its grain production decreases, the presidents' attitudes towards North Korea will become relatively moderate. (3) The fluctuation rate of grain production in North Korea will affect the dove tendency of the presidents. Their stance will be more moderate if the rate decrease. But if the rate rises, the moderation of the statements will retreat.",

Regrowth in the barley varieties decreased strongly from heading to grain maturity. Rye generally showed stronger regrowth than barley after late cutting, but only the perennial variety ‘Soperta’ regenerated as many tillers at cutting as formed when harvested at the ripe grain stage. In both species, significant differences were found between varieties. The level of soluble carbohydrates reached a maximum between heading and maturity, but differences in regrowth could not be explained by such differences. Total N decreased from heading to maturity, except for perennial rye, where an increase was observed towards ripening. It is, however, uncertain whether this was an effect rather than a cause of the regrowth.",

Twenty out of 55 clones resistant to kanamycin in vitro were further analysed under greenhouse conditions and, finally, the performance of 4 clones was examined in the field. An enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to quantify the expression of the marker gene encoded ß‐galactosidase. In the field trial, a significant correlation was found between the expression of ß‐galactosidase and percent of dry matter of the tubers (r= —0.908, P = 0.033). Furthermore, the variation in infection of haulm by Phytophthora infestans was significant among clones (P = 0.001) and accounted for the variation in tuber weight seen among clones (R2 = 0.95). A good correlation of the relative tuber yields of r = 0.997 (P = 0.00025) between the greenhouse and the field suggests that greenhouse experiments can be designed which enable the prediction of field performance of transgenic clones.",

The agroforestry plot carried various combinations ranging from mixed silviculture hedgerows of Leucaena and Gmelina and Parkia and Gmelina to single hedgerow tree species of either Leucaena, or Parkia or Gmelina. Maize had also been grown for four cropping seasons in the alleys provided by the various hedgerow tree species before this investigation. Although soils from all the various combinations would require some urea and SSP fertilizer for optimal maize production, the degree varies. Maize responded more to N and P on soils from the Parkia-based cropping system than on soils from Leucaena's. Nitrogen and P reduced the number of days to tasselling and silking in maize. The paper advocates the integration of mixed silviculture of Leucaena, Parkia and Gmelina into maize cropping systems in the agro-ecosystem.",

Heta) on grain yield and grain N yield under short season, northern growing conditions. Low vigour seed significantly restricted yield formation and grain N yield under early summer drought. The results indicate that the immediate effect of low vigour seed on yield reduction can be obviated by grading seed prior to sowing to ensure plump grains and high kernel weight in seeds matured under favourable growing conditions, but by grading smaller kernels in poor-vigour seeds where dormancy has not necessarily broken in large kernels as a consequence of maturing under unfavourable growing conditions. Protein concentration and protein composition were not good indicators of seed vigour. In a good growing season, N fertilization was an efficient way of reducing the negative impact of poor-vigour seed on subsequent wheat grain N yield.",

Fruit quality components like fruit size, soluble solids content, ground colour, red surface colour and flavour were not affected by planting system or tree density. ‘Aroma’ on M26 in the triple row system with 50% more trees per ha outyielded trees of the single row system with similar within-row spacing by 55%.

Tree heights of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 m were established at 3 m row distance, and 2.25, 2.75 and 3.25 m at 4.5 m row distance. The tree heights were effective from 1985–86; yield and fruit development were followed during 1982–90. Yield per tree, tree size and fruitfulness were larger at the wider row distance, especially for ‘Mutsu’. Thus, in ‘Mutsu’, yield per hectare at 4.5 m equalled that at 3 m, contrary to ‘Discovery’ and ‘Jonagold’, where yield per hectare was higher at 3 m. Also, dry matter contents and colour development (‘Jonagold’) were improved by 4.5 m row distance in several cases. Reduced tree heights decreased yields and colour development (‘Jonagold’), but with minor reductions at tree heights of 2.0–2.5 m during the first 7–8 years. A tree height of 1.5 m, at 3 m row distance, responded negatively, especially for ‘Discovery’ and ‘Jonagold’.",

Fundamental rheological measurements (stress relaxation) on wheat flour doughs with added gluten showed that the effect on the relaxation modulus did depend, not only on the gluten added, but also on the flour to which it was added. In order to select the proper gluten additive, for example in baking, it is not enough to establish the vitality of the gluten; its interaction with the flour has also to be taken into account.
