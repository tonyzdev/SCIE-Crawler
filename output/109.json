    "abstract": "Summary Red amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus) and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) are pseudocereals with particularly highly regarded nutritional value. Because of the high biological significance of the flavonoids and phenolic acids in these plants, qualitative and quantitative analysis has been performed by HPLC. Extracts from the seeds of two amaranth varieties (A. cruentus v. Rawa and v. Aztek) and quinoa seeds, and their sprouts grown in natural conditions and in the dark were analyzed. The main phenolic acid found both in seeds and sprouts was gallic acid. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and cinnamic acid were also found in the seeds and p-coumaric acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid in the sprouts. The main flavonoid found in the sprouts was rutin. Vitexin, isovitexin, and morin were also detected in the sprouts, and orientin, vitexin, isovitexin, morin, and traces of hesperidin and neohesperidin in the seeds. Although sprouting conditions (daylight or darkness) had no effect on gallic acid content, light caused an increase in the amount of rutin and darkness resulted in increased amounts of isovitexin and vitexin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Favipiravir (FVP), a pyrazine analog, has shown antiviral activity against a wide variety of viruses. It is considered to be worth further investigation as a potential candidate drug for COVID-19. It is not officially available in any pharmacopoeia. A rapid, simple, precise, accurate, and isocratic high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed for routine quality control of favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulations. Separation was carried out by C18 column. The mobile phase was a mixture of 50 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 2.3) and acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min −1 . The ultraviolet (UV) detection and column temperature were 323 nm, and 30 °C, respectively. The run time was 15 min under these chromatographic conditions. Excellent linear relationship between peak area and favipiravir concentration in the range of 10–100 μg mL −1 has been observed ( r 2 , 0.9999). Developed method has been found to be sensitive (limits of detection and quantification were 1.20 μg mL −1 and 3.60 μg mL −1 , respectively), precise (the interday and intraday relative standard deviation (RSD) values for peak area and retention time were less than 0.4 and 0.2%, respectively), accurate (recovery, 99.19–100.17%), specific and robust (% RSD were less than 1.00, for system suitability parameters). Proposed method has been successfully applied for quantification of favipiravir in pharmaceutical formulations.",

Nowadays, the arousing interest in greener and sustainable analytical chemistry has increased the development of microextraction techniques as alternative sample preparation procedures. In this review, we aimed to show two different categorizations of the most used micro-solid-phase extraction (μSPE) techniques. In essence, the first one concerns the solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent selection and structure: normal-phase, reversed-phase, ion-exchange, mixed-mode, molecular imprinted polymer, and special techniques (e.g., doped cartridges for specific analytes). The second is a grouping of the commercially available μSPE products in categories and sub-categories. We present every device and technology into the classifications paying attention to their historical development and the actual state of the art. So, this study aims to provide the state-of-the-art of μSPE techniques, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and possible future developments in sample pretreatment.",

A total of 58 compounds extracted by methanol were detected and tentatively identified within 20 min, including hydrophilic phenolics, lipophilic diterpenoids, a verbascose, and several organic acids. These compounds were separated on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column and identified based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation patterns under the positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Among them, micranthin B and 9-oxo-10E,12Zoctadecadienoic acid were reported in RSM for the first time. Their fragmentation patterns in electrospray ionization (ESI)—MS/MS spectra were first investigated by matching their accurate molecular masses. This contribution presented one of the first reports on the analysis of hydrophilic phenolics and lipophilic diterpenoids from Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae using UPLC/Q-TOF-MS.

Studies indicate that substances such as beta-sitosterol and cholecalciferol may have therapeutic benefits for prostate disorders. This study aims to innovate the HPLC approach for the coexisting quantification of beta-sitosterol in Pygeum extract ( Prunus africana ) and cholecalciferol, providing a comprehensive strategy for evaluating the quality of herbal products targeting prostate health. The RP-HPLC technique was appraised using modified green star area (MoGSA) and BAGI metrics based on an Inertsil ODS-3 C18 column with a mobile phase of methanol and acetonitrile in a 95:5 ratio and detection at 210 nm. The strategy exhibited outstanding resolution, precision, and robustness, with a 12-min runtime. The method's linearity was confirmed with R 2 above 0.99, and the LOD and LOQ values were 0.61 μg mL −1 , 0.76 μg mL −1 , and 1.85 μg mL −1 , 2.31 μg mL −1 for beta-sitosterol and cholecalciferol, respectively. Precision intra- and inter-day testing revealed RSD below 2%, confirming the method's reliability. Recovery studies indicated high accuracy, with recoveries of 101.50, 100.99, and 101.17, 100.92% in the pharmaceutical formulations and the supplement formulations for beta-sitosterol and cholecalciferol, respectively. This innovative dual-action approach may provide a promising therapeutic strategy by targeting multiple pathways involved in prostate function and disease prevention.",

In the screening step, many factors, potentially affecting the separation, are screened to identify those with the largest effects. These are then further examined in an optimization phase, to determine the best separation conditions. After optimizing the method, it should be validated, before use for quantitative purposes. Robustness testing is part of method validation and examines the effects on the responses of small changes in method conditions. During the first phase of method optimization and during robustness testing, so-called screening designs are usually applied, whereas during the second phase of optimization, response-surface designs are often used. In this tutorial, the different steps in the application of both types of design are explained and elaborated with some examples.",

Ultra-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC–Q-TOF-MS/MS) method was established for characterization and identification of the major flavonoids in PES leaf extract. A total of 13 flavonoids were simultaneously characterized, and their proposed characteristic product ions and fragmentation pathways were investigated. Thirteen compounds were separated on an Agilent Zorbax RRHD SB-C18 column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm).

The use of extensive volumes of hazardous organic solvents and production of large amounts of waste make LLE procedures unsuitable for modern, highly automated laboratories, expensive, and environmentally unfriendly. In the past two decades, liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) was introduced to overcome these drawbacks. Thanks to the need of only a few microliters of extraction solvent, LPME techniques have been widely adopted by the scientific community. The aim of this review is to report on the state-of-the-art LPME techniques used in gas and liquid chromatography. Attention was paid to the classification of the LPME operating modes, to the historical contextualization of LPME applications, and to the advantages of microextraction in methods respecting the value of green analytical chemistry. Technical aspects such as description of methodology selected in method development for routine use, specific variants of LPME developed for complex matrices, derivatization, and enrichment techniques are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aflatoxins (AFs) and deoxynivalenol (DON), common mycotoxins in cereals, pose contamination risks in beer production, often persisting from raw barley into final products. This study investigates the transfer and decomposition of AFs and DON during the barley steeping stage of malting. Barley spiked with AFs and DON was steeped, and mycotoxin concentrations were analyzed in both the barley residue and the resulting wastewater. Results indicated that AF and DON transfer into wastewater was influenced by water solubility, though concentrations remained below solubility limits. AFs and DON residues were also detected in the steeped barley. Decomposition studies showed that while AFs were partially degraded by UV light, DON required photocatalysis for effective degradation. However, matrix components in wastewater decreased the efficiency of DON decomposition, suggesting that preliminary removal of organic components from wastewater could enhance photocatalytic detoxification. These findings provide insight into mycotoxin management strategies for brewing wastewater, emphasizing the need for targeted pretreatment to improve degradation efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The preservation of water resources is seriously threatened by the rise of pharmaceutical contamination. Ribavirin, a widely used antiviral drug, is among the pharmaceutical residues in wastewater. In this study, the adsorption capacity of activated carbon produced from tobacco stems, a by-product of the cigarette industry, was investigated. The produced activated carbon was characterised by BET, SEM-EDX and FTIR analyses. In the next step, removal of ribavirin from aqueous solutions using activated carbon was investigated. In the next step, the removal of ribavirin from aqueous solutions was tested with this activated carbon. Various factors such as initial ribavirin concentration (10–50 μg mL −1 ), solution pH (4–10), adsorbent amount (5–30 mg per 50 mL solution), contact time (0–150 min) and temperature (300–328 K) were investigated to determine the optimum adsorption conditions. Adsorption kinetics were investigated with first and second order pseudo models, and the equilibrium state was analyzed with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated at different temperatures (300, 308, 318 and 328 K). The results show that a maximum removal efficiency of 91.83% was achieved at an initial concentration of 30 μg mL −1 , adsorbent dose of 20 mg, contact time of 90 min and pH 7.00. The adsorption process was best described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model ( R 2 : 0.9987) and Langmuir isotherm model ( R 2 : 0.9971). Thermodynamic analysis shows that the process is spontaneous (ΔG &lt; 0), exothermic (ΔH &lt; 0) and causes a decrease in disorder in the system (ΔS &lt; 0). This study reveals that tobacco stems can offer an environmentally friendly and economic treatment alternative.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, each with distinct mechanisms of action, have a well-established use in hyperlipidemia treatment. The recent adoption of their fixed-dose combination therapy has gained significant attention due to its enhanced therapeutic efficacy in managing hyperlipidemia and improved patient convenience. However, both active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) face challenges related to low bioavailability and non-selective action, highlighting the need for delivery systems able to target and control their release at the site of action. To overcome these limitations, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) have been developed, leveraging the combined advantages of lipid and polymer nanocarriers for improved API delivery. This study focuses on the development and validation of a simple reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for the determination of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe in the developed LPHNPs, optimized to assess critical attributes of quality such as encapsulation efficiency (EE) and API loading capacity, which influence therapeutic outcomes. Chromatographic separation was achieved by using a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column and a mobile phase of diluted formic acid and acetonitrile (55:45, V/V ) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min −1 . Detection was performed at 240 nm. The method was validated according to ICH Q2(R2) guideline, demonstrating excellent linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness. The proposed method was used for the successful quantification of the EE and loading capacity of both APIs in LPHNPs, showing also potential for analysing their release profile by which valuable insights into their release mechanism and kinetics from the nanoparticle system could be obtained, and the stability of the designed delivery system as well, by providing effective assessment of API leakages from the LPHNPs over time, when kept at specific storage conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite extensive development and widespread use, existing methods for analysis of caffeine and paracetamol overlook their environmental impact. Furthermore, these methods were not developed using the Analytical Quality by Design approach, leading to a significant gap in understanding critical separation factors. Moreover, the absence of a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) method for the simultaneous analysis of caffeine and paracetamol, integrating Analytical Quality by Design and a comprehensive green approach, presents an exciting opportunity for innovation and advancement in the field. In this paper, we report an efficient and sustainable HILIC method for caffeine and paracetamol analysis, which is based on Analytical Quality by Design, green and white chemistry principles. Optimal chromatographic conditions were adjusted using an InertSil Diol column with the mobile phase of acetonitrile and ammonium acetate buffer. The method was validated according to the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines, and its applicability in the analysis of Panadol Extra® tablets was confirmed. Relative standard deviation values were 0.07–0.28% for accuracy and 0.45–0.54% for precision. The environmental footprint and effectiveness of the method were evaluated through assessments of triple-color analysis which showed the dominance of green, blue, and white with scores of 0.66, 85.0, and 83.3, respectively. These parameters confirm that the method is eco-friendly, reliable, accurate, and precise for future use in the analysis of dosage forms containing caffeine and paracetamol. This is the first time that the Analytical Quality by Design approach has been combined with green and white chemistry principles, creating a strong synergy for the development of environmentally friendly methods.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY A simple, economic, selective, precise, and stability-indicating HPLC method has been developed and validated for analysis of celecoxib (CXB), a selective COX-2 inhibitor, both in bulk drug and in microemulsions. Reversed-phase chromatography was performed on a C18 column with methanol–water, 75:25 (%, v/v), as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.25 mL min −1 . Detection was performed at 250 nm and a sharp peak was obtained for CXB at a retention time of 4.8 ± 0.01 min. Linear regression analysis data for the calibration plot showed there was a good linear relationship between response and concentration in the range 0.27–80 µg mL −1 ; the regression coefficient was 0.996 and the linear regression equation was y = 48415x + 54359. The detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) limits were 0.086 and 0.2625 µg mL −1 respectively. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, specificity, robustness, and detection and quantification limits, in accordance with ICH guidelines. Statistical analysis proved the method was precise, reproducible, selective, specific, and accurate for analysis of CXB. The wide linearity range, sensitivity, accuracy, short retention time, and simple mobile phase imply the method is suitable for routine quantification of CXB with high precision and accuracy.",

The first method entails hydrolysis of the flavonoid compounds and subsequent chromatographic assay of the aglycones obtained, quercetin and kaempferol, for rapid and simple quantification of the total flavonoid content (125 mm × 4 mm, 5-µm particle, ODS column; mobile phase 40–60% methanol gradient in a 0.5% aqueous solution of orthophosphoric acid; run time 7 min). The second method is a direct procedure for simultaneous quantification of six glycosidic compounds (rutin, hyperoside, reynoutrin, guajiverin, avicularin, and juglanin) and chlorogenic acid (250 mm × 4 mm, 5-µm particle, LiChrospher 100 column; mobile phase acetonitrile gradient in a 0.5% aqueous solution of orthophosphoric acid). The precision, accuracy, and reproducibility of the methods used were apparent from good linearity (R = 0.9805–0.9995), recovery of the internal standards (93.5–98.5%), and low RSD values (0.4–7.2% for biological plant material). The method for analysis of the aglycones, and its simple modifications can, moreover, be recommended for qualitative and quantitative analysis of three common flavonols – quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin. This was shown for hydrolysed extracts obtained from six popular medicinal plants (Hypericum perforatum, Sambucus nigra, Calendula officinalis, Solidago virgaurea, Tilia sp., and Gingko biloba).",

More attention, however, should be paid to the other alkaloids which would be favorable or unfavorable to the efficacy and safety of the products.

Diglycoside vasicine, vasicine, vasicinone, harmalol, harmol, tetrahydroharmine, 8-hydroxy-harmine, ruine, harmaline, and harmine were separated and identified with reference substances and characteristic MS spectra in extracts by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Three trace alkaloids, vasicine, harmalol, and harmol were determined using the developed chromatographic separation method subsequently. The average contents of vasicine, harmalol, and harmol in extracts of ten batches were 2.53 ± 0.73, 0.54 ± 0.19, and 0.077 ± 0.03%, respectively.

Pluchea dioscoridis is widely known Egyptian wooden plant that has been extensively applied for different medicinal purposes. In this study, LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of the potent antimicrobial ethyl acetate and n -butanol extracts of P. dioscoridis leaves led to identification of 28 and 21 compounds, respectively. The identified compounds were categorized as phenolic acids, phenolic acids derivatives, organic acids, flavonoids (aglycones and glycosides), secoiridoids, coumarin derivatives, and gallotannins derivatives. Among them, caffeic acid 3-sulfate was the most predominate in the investigated extracts followed by ferulic acid and dicaffeoyl-quinic acid. Also, the antimicrobial potentiality of different extracts was evaluated against different pathogenic microbes including Enterobacter cloacae , Micrococcus leutus , Aeromonas hydrophila , Bacillus subtilis , Bacillus cereus , Bacillus lichneformis and Clostridium sp ecies. Furthermore, different concentrations of the most potent extract were assayed for antibacterial efficacy on growth curve kinetics against the susceptible bacteria along 4days incubation period. Our gathered data confirmed that, the antimicrobial activity against tested bacteria was different according to the solvent used in the extraction process. Mostly, all the extracts showed a wide spectrum antibacterial activity except the plant water extract which shows a mild activity against Clostridium sp. only. Based on the highest inhibition zone diameter, the ethyl acetate extract followed by butanol extract exhibited the highest inhibition zone with Micrococcus luteus and B. subtilis (20.0 and 18.5 mm) respectively. Determining the effect of ethyl acetate extract at different concentration (0, 0.66, 1.66, 3.33, 6.67, 13.34 and 20.01 mg mL −1 ) on M. luteus growth kinetics, the data assured that the antibacterial activity shows concentration dependent manner with the highest antibacterial activity at 20.01 mg mL −1 culture. The data also confirmed that, none of the selected concentration showed bactericidal activity in the prepared cultures, and with the prolonged incubation period the bacteria acquire resistance against the extract beginning from second or third day of incubation.",

Two other methods (liquid–liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction) were tested for onestep clean-up and sample enrichment but it was found that one-step procedures did not remove lipids completely. Linearity of calibration plots was good for all PAH in the concentration range from the detection limit (approx. 0.1 ppb) to 100 ppb. The repeatability (RSD, n = 6) for different PAH ranged from 0.5 to 5%. Analysis of standard reference materials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (mussel tissue, SRM 2978), the Community Bureau of Reference (coconut oil, CRM 458), and the Central Science Laboratory (olive oils, FAPAS 0615, 0618, and 0621) resulted in a good agreement between measured and certified concentrations.

Methylation at 80°C resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of trans,trans (t,t) CLA isomers and in loss of cis,trans/trans,cis CLA isomers, as a result of intra-isomerization and formation of artefacts. Methylation at 40°C, in contrast, seems to enable the most accurate quantification of CLA isomers, because it resulted in no noticeable intra-isomerization of conjugated dienes or formation of artefacts. Under these derivatization conditions, other FA methyl esters (FAMEs) also seem to be accurately quantified. The proposed procedure adequately prepares FAMEs from FA standards and from lipids in biological samples, because mild saponification and methylation at 40°C using typical basic and acidic catalysts and subsequent extraction with a smaller volume of heptane resulted in satisfactory accuracy of quantification, negligible changes in the composition of FAs, especially conjugated dienes, and a better yield of FAMEs. The proposed improved procedure, comprising mild lipid saponification and methylation at 40°C in solutions carefully flushed with argon (Ar) (derivatization–Ar), in the absence of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, then extraction with 4 mL heptane, seemed the most satisfactory method of preparing FAs, particularly CLA isomers, for chromatographic quantification by argentation–liquid chromatography, the method of choice for analysis of fatty acids containing conjugated double bonds.",

The chromatographic behaviour of these substances on different columns was studied using mobile phases of different polarity. The optimum separations were achieved by gradient elution on a 4.6 mm × 20 mm, 3.5 µm particle size, C18 column. The mobile phase was a gradient prepared by mixing 7:93 (v/v) acetonitrile–25 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 5, and 50:50 (v/v) acetonitrile–25 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate pH 5 in different ratios. The flow rate was 1.0 mL min −1 . UV detection was performed at 215 nm. Methylparaben was used as internal standard. The method was validated for selectivity, linearity, precision, and accuracy. The limits of detection, LOD, and quantification, LOQ, were determined experimentally. Because of its speed and accuracy the method can be used for quality-control analysis.",

The compounds were separated on aluminumbacked silica gel 60 F254 plates with n-hexane–2-propanol–acetone–ammonia–formic acid, 3:3.8:2.8:0.3:0.1 (v/v) as mobile phase. This system was found to give compact spots for isoniazid and rifampicin (RF values 0.59 ± 0.02 and 0.73 ± 0.04, respectively). Densitometric analysis of isoniazid and rifampicin was performed at 254 nm. Regression analysis data for the calibration plots were indicative of good linear relationships between response and concentration over the range 100–700 ng per spot. The correlation coefficients, r 2 , were 0.994 and 0.997 for isoniazid and rifampicin respectively. The values of slope and intercept of the calibration plots were 3.755 ± 0.22 and 3099.1 ± 51.21, respectively, for isoniazid and 4.0957 ± 0.25 and 3567.6 ± 61.11, respectively, for rifampicin.

Isoniazid and rifampicin were subjected to acid, base, peroxide, and UV-induced degradation. In stability tests the drugs were susceptible to acid and basic hydrolysis, oxidation and photodegradation. Statistical analysis proved the method is repeatable, selective, and accurate for estimation of isoniazid and rifampicin.

HPLC with monolithic reverse phase silica column (4.6 × 100 mm) and simple isocratic elution of methanol-water mixed with dioxane facilitated the separation of lignans of diverse nature such as diarylbutyrolactone, tetrahydrofuran, isomeric aryltetralin, and diarylbutane type for quantitative analysis. Targeted lignans viz. heliobuphthalmin lactone (1), virgatusin (2), hypophyllanthin (3), phyllanthin (4), nirtetralin (5), and niranthin (6) were confirmed unambiguously in four Phyllanthus species by their abundant molecular adduct ions, retention time, UV, and mass spectra as compared with those of reference compounds. Advantages and limitations of both detection techniques for qualitative (fingerprinting) and quantitative analysis of the above mentioned lignans in four Phyllanthus spp. are discussed. The method was validated following international guidelines. The described method can be utilized for assays and stability tests of P. amarus extracts as well as traditional Indian medicine based on Phyllanthus herb.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the last few years, the use of surfactants as mobile phase additives in reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) has been steadily developing and improving. Surfactants modify the polarity of the stationary phase which in turn decreases the amount of organic solvent required for elution of the analytes rendering the methodologies linked to them greener and more eco-friendly. Brij-35 is a fatty alcohol ethoxylates non ionic surfactant, which is less widely used as mobile phase additive. Brij-35 can decrease stationary phase polarity while remaining neutral. In this research, Brij-35 was studied in the separation and determination of marketed antihypertensive combination therapy composed of triamterene (TRM) and xipamide (XIP). TRM and XIP are diuretics used for treatment of essential hypertension and associated edema conditions. Chromatographic separation was achieved on RP-C18 column (Kinetix®, 5 µm, 15 cm × 4.6 mm) at flow rate 1 mL min −1 and UV-detection at 254 nm. Isocratic elution was performed using mobile phase composed of 0.1 M Brij-35: methanol (MeOH) (60:40, v/v). The analytes were well separated and quantified within linearity ranges of 5–50 µg mL −1 for both drugs in short retention time (2.6 and 5.3 min. for TRM and XIP, respectively). Since claiming greenness is not enough, Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) was used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the previously reported methods. GAPI is a new metric for evaluation of the ecological impact of analytical procedures. The proposed method was validated according to ICH guidelines and applied successfully for simultaneous determination of the drugs in their co-formulated tablets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monitoring medications in biological fluids is an essential aspect of patient care, particularly in cases of altered mental status where accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and even forensic examinations are crucial. In this study, a new approach combining hydrophobic-deep-eutectic and solvent-bar-microextraction (HDE-SBME) followed by a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) was developed for the simultaneous determination of desipramine, clomipramine, as antidepressant and carbamazepine as antiepileptic agents in untreated human urine and plasma samples. The HDE solvents, synthesized using various ratios of menthol and fatty acids, were utilized in the SBME setups. Computational methods were employed to predict the structure and modes of interaction between HDE and the chosen analytes. Central composite design methodology (CCD) was used for multivariate optimization of the effects of different parameters influencing the extraction efficiency of the proposed method. Under optimized experimental conditions, the calibration graph of the spiked selected drugs in urine and plasma samples demonstrated excellent linearity ( R 2 ≥ 0.994), with limits of detection/quantification below 0.60/2.02 μg L −1 . The extraction recoveries achieved were 88–97%, and the repeatability/reproducibility (RSD%, n = 5) was less than 6.12/7.57. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine selected drugs in patients' urine and plasma samples. The proposed method detects three drugs in patients' urine and plasma samples without using toxic volatile organic solvents. The proposed microextraction technique exhibited a confident sensitivity, feasible operation, and simplicity compared with other published methods. Thus, it can be considered a promising method for monitoring the therapeutic levels of specific antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs in urine and plasma samples.",

Surprisingly enough, TLC is relatively seldom used for separation of enantiomers, even though – despite the low number of theoretical plates (N) in this particular technique in comparison with fully automated column chromatographic techniques (basically GC and HPLC) – it seems very well suited for complete separation of two analytes only (i.e. a pair of enantiomers). Separation of profens can be regarded as a particularly urgent analytical task, because they are among the most widely prescribed synthetic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and in medicinal chemistry we must be vigilantly aware of possible unpredictable consequences of dispensing medicines as racemic mixtures. In earlier and in more recent studies we have provided enough evidence not only to prove that the analytical performance of TLC is sufficient for separation of the enantiomers of ibuprofen, but also – even more important – to demonstrate the usefulness of this simple yet very efficient separation technique in physicochemical studies of the oscillatory instability of profens when stored for long periods of time in aqueous media. By use of TLC it was possible to show the oscillatory transenantiomerization of the profens from the S to the R form, and vice versa, during storage. The correctness of our TLC assessment with regard to structural oscillation of enantiomeric profens was later successfully confirmed by means of polariemetry.",

The detection limit of the method (including saponification, extraction, and HPLC analysis) was 0.65 µg mL −1 δ-tocopherol in milk. The proposed saponification step was a simple modification of the method, because it was performed in the same tube as the extraction, took 30 min only, and did not involve use of an inert gas.

The new variants FDNP-l-Met-NH2 and FDNP-d-Phg-NH2 were characterized and used for derivatization of twenty-six α-amino acids. The resulting diastereomeric derivatives were separated on a reversed-phase C18 HPLC column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile and aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and the results were compared with those obtained by use of Marfey's reagent. To determine and establish the efficiency of both the new variants, separation results were compared for diastereomers of five representative amino acids (Ala, Phe, Ser, Asp, and Asn) prepared with MR, FDNP-l-Phe-NH2, FDNP-l-Val-NH2, FDNP-l-Leu-NH2, and FDNP-l-Pro-NH2, experiments being performed under identical conditions.

In this study, a three-dimensional framework [Zn2(d-Cam)2(4,4′-bpy)]n with large homochiral channel and the orderly arrangement of left- and right-handed helices was used as chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in gas chromatography (GC). [Zn2(d-Cam)2 (4,4′-bpy)]n-coated open tubular column was prepared by a dynamic coating method for high-resolution GC. Some racemates, isomers, linear alkanes, and alcohols are used as the targets for separation. The column coating properties efficiency, polarity, and selectivity were studied. The experimental results show that the stationary phase has outstanding selectivity and also possesses good recognition ability toward these compounds.",

The combined approach of Green Analytical Method with Quality by Design-based risk assessment was done using the Ishikawa fishbone diagram followed by a rotatable central composite design used for the optimization. The optimal chromatographic separation was attained through a mobile phase of 72: 28% v/v ethanol and 0.1% orthophosphoric acid (pH 3.5), with a 0.31 mL min −1 flow rate. The developed UPLC-PDA method was sensitive and specific for pitavastatin and ezetimibe, with linearity ranging from 2 to 30, 10–150 μg mL −1 with an R 2 of 0.9999 and 0.9997, respectively. The forced degradation study of stability-indicating assay results shows the degradation in respective stress conditions. The developed UPLC method was validated and found to have sensible results with good linearity, accuracy and precision. Further, the greenness was evaluated using five states of art metrics like NEMI, GAPI, AES, AMGS, and AGREE metrics and found the greenest results. Based on the results we concluded that the developed UPLC method could be efficient for the simultaneous determination of pitavastatin and ezetimibe in bulk and tablet dosage.",

Further optimization was then performed either by reducing the analysis time or increasing efficiency. The case studies led to the development of a general methodology consisting of sample preparation and HPLC fingerprint development. The fingerprints obtained with the developed methodology were then successfully used to distinguish between the two Artemisia species and between the two Ligusticum species.

A major cause of a variety of diseases is oxidative stress which is reduced by antioxidants such as polyphenols. These secondary metabolites are generally ubiquitous in plants and extensively used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. In this study a simple and sensitive HPLC-UV-MS-MS-based method was developed for separation, identification, and quantification of polyphenols, for example gallic, protocatechuic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and ferulic acids, rutin, quercetin, and kaempferol. Amounts of polyphenols detected in 50% methanol-water extracts of the plant varied from 0.005% (kaempferol) to 0.24% (protocatechuic acid). Separation of the polyphenols was achieved on a reversed-phase C18 with a mobile phase prepared from 1% aqueous with acetic acid and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1. The phenolic compounds were detected by UV absorption at 254 nm. The method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD, LOQ, specificity, selectivity, and compound stability. Results from intra and inter-day validation (n = 6) showed the method was efficient and rapid. The optimized method was applied to extracts of A. pallens for identification and quantification of the polyphenols.

Robustness was assessed for a previously validated method developed for chromatographic analysis of perindopril tert-butylamine and its impurities. Eleven factors (seven real and four dummies) in twelve experiments were examined. Robustness was assessed by graphical (half-normal probability plots and Pareto charts) and statistical (t-test) methods. For estimation of the standard error of effect (necessary for t-test estimation) calculations based on negligible effects and Dong's algorithm were used at the significance levels α= 0.05 and α = 0.01. In this way the effect of the factors was completely defined and, furthermore, nonsignificant intervals for significant variables were calculated. Finally, on the basis of the worst-case situation, system-suitability tests were performed and acceptance limits for certain values were calculated.",

    "abstract": "Summary Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) is a liquid chromatography technique when a polar stationary phases — silica or polar bonded phases and aqueous mobile phase containing amount of a less polar solvent (often acetonitrile) is applied. HILIC is important for the separation of highly polar substances including biologically active compounds, such as drugs, amino acids, peptides, proteins, nucleosides, neurotransmitters, etc. HILIC is also the appropriate method for analysis of plant extract polar components such as carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides, phenolic acids, flavonoids and some alkaloids. Plant extracts are usually multicomponent mixtures of compounds of wide polarity range, which often cannot be analyzed by use of a single separation and detection method because of the high chemical diversity. Good results are obtained by use of coupled method, e.g., reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) and HILIC mode separation. The elution order in HILIC is usually opposite to that in RP separations. This orthogonality determines one of the advantages of HILIC — the possibility of creating multidimensional separations. An important feature of HILIC is the improved sensitivity with electrospray mass spectrometry. This is significant for the analysis of components existing in small concentration in multicomponent mixtures. The high acetonitrile content also gives additional advantage of HILIC — faster separations due to the lower viscosity of HILIC eluents compared to standard RP ones. The presented review deals with the optimization of HILIC separations and application of the method for analysis of plant extracts components.",

    "abstract": "World consumption of formaldehyde (FA) is forecast to grow at an average annual rate of about 4% from 2015 to 2020 with world production to exceed 52 million tons in 2017. From the first day of January 2016, the Commission Regulation No. 91/2015 established the FA classification through an indication from European Chemical Agency as category 2 mutagenic and category 1B carcinogen. A novel method for the determination of gaseous FA in air is presented herewith. The sampling was carried out using a miniaturized cartridge by means of a medium-flow pumping system (1.0 L min -1 , 5–60 min) and absorption of FA vapors on 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Cartridge desorption removing the excess derivatizing agent based upon solid-phase extraction was performed by an innovative xyz robotic system on-line with fast gas chromatography (GC)—mass spectrometry (MS). Through the generation of standard atmospheres of known concentration of FA, we evaluated the precision (relative standard deviation for n = 10, 8.8%), lower limit of quantification (0.072 µg/cartridge), and linearity (from 0.125—64 µg/cartridge with correlation coefficient of 0.99) of the method. The described procedure combines the efficiency of fast GC—MS systems with both the high throughput of autosampler and the quantitative accuracy of FA-dinitrophenylhydrazone for measuring American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists TLV Ceiling.",

    "abstract": "A new high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for determination of triclosan (TCS) and flurbiprofen (FBP) was successfully developed and validated at a single wavelength. The method involves extraction of the targeted drugs from nanogels and simulated saliva by using methanol as the extractant. The Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) was used for the chromatographic separations. The effects of various parameters were extensively evaluated and optimized. The optimal HPLC conditions were acetonitrile and 0.001 M citric acid (90:10, v/v ) with a pH of 3.24 as the mobile phase, at a 0.3 mL/min flow rate under isocratic elution mode. Excellent sensitivity and specificity were achieved by ultraviolet (UV) detection at 242 nm. The method also demonstrated excellent linearity within the test range of 10–100 μg/mL with the correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) of 0.9998 for both the analytes. The practical applicability of the method was demonstrated by recovering TCS and FBP from nanogels and simulated saliva. The recovery of the analytes from the nanogels and the spiked simulated saliva samples was in the range of 97–98% and 96–99%, respectively, and their respective relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 0.9% in both cases. System suitability parameters were found to be within acceptable limits. The method is simple, specific, and precise, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first reported validated quantitative HPLC method for the concurrent determination of TCS and FBP in a pharmaceutical dental product. The method can be useful in the routine quality control analysis of dental formulations with TCS and FBP contents or products with a similar composition.",

The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation in Deryng apparatus. It was found that the analyzed essential oils varied in terms of chemical composition depending on the variety and conditions of growth. Sixty-four to 87 different compounds were identified in the oils. Essential oils of all 3 varieties obtained in in vitro cultures contained large amounts of borneol (13–32%). This compound was also dominant in plants obtained from in vivo conditions in varieties Ellagance Purple (11%) and Blue River (13%), and in the Munstead variety, the dominant compound was linalool (13%). High concentration of epi -α-cadinol (10–20%) was found in essential oils obtained from in vitro cultured plants. Globulol was found in high concentration (10%) in the Munstead variety grown in in vitro conditions.

A D-optimal design was used to screen the effect of solvents, volume of solvents, time from spotting to development and time for development to scanning. ANOVA results and Pareto chart revealed that toluene, methanol, water and saturation time had an impact on retention time. The critical method and material attributes were further screened by Box-Behnken design (BBD) to achieve optimal chromatographic condition. A stress degradation study was carried out and structure of major alkaline degradant was elaborated. According to the design space, a control strategy was used with toluene: methanol: water (6:2:2) and the saturation time was 15 min. A retention factor (RF) of 0.59 ± 0.05 was achieved for RBN using chromatographic plate precoated with silica gel at detection wavelength 282 nm with optimized conditions. The linear calibration curve was achieved in the concentration range of 200–1,200 ng/band with r 2 &gt; 0.998 suggesting good coordination between analyte concentration and peak areas. The quadratic model was demonstrated as the best fit model and no interaction was noted between CMAs. The optimized HPTLC method was validated critically as stated in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q2 (R1) guideline and implemented successfully for stress degradation study of RBN. The developed HPTLC method obtained through AQbD application was potentially able to resolve all degradants of RBN achieved through forced degradation study. The obtained results demonstrate that a scientific AQbD approach implementation in HPTLC method development and stress degradation study drastically minimizes the number of trials in experiments, ultimately time and cost of analysis could be minimized.",

    "abstract": "Enantiomer separation by TLC is still much less frequent than with other, mostly instrumental, chromatographic techniques. From a literature survey it is apparent that separation of the enantiomers of d,l-lactic acid is primarily of interest to the diary industry and that this particular separation is less frequently performed by chromatographic than by membrane techniques. As far as we are aware, before our studies only one report of TLC separation of the enantiomers of d,l-lactic acid was available in the literature; this is dated 1991 and describes the use of non-instrumental TLC only. In this study, we started by reproducing the TLC procedure originating from 1991, for this purpose using TLC with automatic sample application and densitometric detection. We managed to repeat the earlier procedure and to achieve full, i.e. baseline, separation of the enantiomers, with a remarkable distance between the two antimers. However, we revealed a significant drawback of this separation procedure — d-(−)-lactic acid was transported almost with the mobile-phase front and its densitometric quantification was barely possible because of the relatively high UV absorption of the mobile-phase front line. The reference method for separation of the enantiomers of d,l-lactic acid consisted in preliminary impregnation of commercial silica gel TLC plates with copper(II) acetate. In-situ formation of bidentate complexes of the d,l-lactic acid antimers with the Cu2+ cation resulted in different mobilities of these complex cations in the planar chromatographic system. The objectives of this study were twofold — to investigate separation of the enantiomers of d,l-lactic acid with other transition metal cations (i.e., Co2+, Ni2+, and Mn2+) used to impregnate the silica gel (to achieve resolution that might enable quantification of the two lactic acid antimers and not only the l-(+) enantiomer) and to gain deeper insight into the mechanism of separation with these metal cations. For purposes of comparison, we chromatographed d,l-lactic acid on non-impregnated silica gel layers. As a result, we managed to establish efficient separation conditions with the Ni2+ and Co2+ cations that outperformed the earlier established procedure involving the Cu2+ cation, and — partially at least — to elucidate the mechanism of separation of the enantiomers of d,l-lactic acid by these TLC systems. The Mn2+ cation proved unsuitable for the purpose. Finally, we managed to separate the enantiomers of d, l-lactic acid on non-impregnated silica gel layer also, which seems yet more proof of the microcrystalline chirality of silica gel used as stationary phase and of its substantial contribution to the enantiomer separation investigated.",

Response was a linear function of the concentration of standard solutions in the range 100 to 1000 ng per band and 50 to 500 ng per band, respectively, with correlation coefficients of 0.9992 ± 0.04 and 0.9986 ± 0.06, for trigonelline and 4-hydroxyisoleucine. The accuracy of the method was checked by determination of recovery at three different levels; average percentage recovery was 99.39 ± 0.34 for trigonelline and 99.03 ± 0.26 for 4-hydroxyisoleucine. The method was found to be simple, precise, specific, sensitive, and accurate and can be used for routine quality control of fenugreek seeds and also for quantitative analysis of these marker compounds in processed fenugreek and its marketed preparations.",

The two drugs were satisfactorily resolved with RF values 0.23 ± 0.01 and 0.39 ± 0.01 for atorvastatin calcium and ezetimibe, respectively. The accuracy and reliability of the method was assessed by evaluation of linearity (0.4–2.4 µg/zone for both atorvastatin calcium and ezetimibe), precision (intra-day RSD 1.16–1.25% and inter-day RSD 1.16–1.44% for atorvastatin calcium, and intra-day RSD 0.47–0.63% and inter-day RSD 0.47–0.88% for ezetimibe), accuracy (98.51 ± 0.23% for atorvastatin calcium and 99.01 ± 0.15% for ezetimibe), and specificity, in accordance with ICH guidelines. The method can be used for analysis of ten or more formulations on a single plate and is a rapid and cost-effective quality-control tool for routine simultaneous analysis of atorvastatin calcium and ezetimibe as the bulk drug and in tablet formulations.",

To measure β-sitosterol content without derivatization, GC-FID was used with 5-α-cholestan-3-one as internal standard. To identify terpenoid constituents, GC-MS was used; β-sitosterol, phytol, lanost-7-en-3-on, α-amyrin, β-amyrin, and lupeol were identified. We established that for Morus leaf the best SFE method for β-sitosterol was pilot scale SFE; the β-sitosterol content of this extract was higher than that of the hexane solvent extract. Among analytical SFE conditions, 200 bar for 90 min and 300 bar for 60 min resulted in extraction of the most β-sitosterol. For mulberry stem bark, solvent extraction with hexane and SFE at 400 bar and 40°C for 60 min proved the best methods.",

Avanafil tablets were exposed to acid, base, water, oxidative, thermal, and photolytic degradation conditions. In acid, oxidative, thermal, and humidity degradation, significant degradation was observed. All the degradants observed during degradation were separated from known impurities of avanafil by using reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC.

Because of poor resolution of preparative HPLC, recycled preparative HPLC was applied for separation of curcumin with higher purity up to five cycles. Recycled preparative HPLC resulted in improvement in separation factors which led to the increase of curcumin purity up to 99.5%.

    "abstract": "A simple, selective, and sensitive thin-layer chromatographic—densitometric method has been developed for the determination of sulfasalazine besides its possible impurities in pharmaceutical preparations. The mobile phase was composed of ethyl acetate—methanol—ammonia 25% 10:7:3 (υ/υ/υ), and the stationary phase was aluminum plates precoated with silica gel 60 F254 that enabled to obtain well resolved peaks of sulfasalazine and its impurities. The developed chromatograms were analyzed densitometrically at λ = 360 nm. RF values and ultraviolet (UV) spectra were used to identify the compounds. The developed method is highly sensitive (limit of detection [LOD] = 17.11 ng spot−1, limit of quantitation [LOQ] = 51.84 ng spot−1), precise (relative standard deviation [RSD] = 1.43%–4.28%), and accurate (RSD = 1.64%–4.27%). The linearity of the method was checked within the range 20–120 ng spot−1. The method was successfully applied for the determination of sulfasalazine in pharmaceutical preparations besides its impurities. The structures of impurities present in the standard substance and in pharmaceutical preparations were established by ultra-performance liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC—MS/MS) technique.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our work was to optimize and apply simple high-performance liquid chromatography method with ultraviolet detection (HPLC—UV) for simultaneous determination of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in biological matrix (specifically, the rat liver tissue was used herein), since the ratio between oxidized and reduced glutathione forms (GSSG—GSH) has been recognized as an important biological marker of oxidatively depleted GSH in oxidative stress (OS)-associated diseases and poisonings. An isocratic chromatographic separation of GSH and GSSG (2.8 min and 6.3 min, respectively) was performed with the mobile phase consisted of sodium perchlorate solution (pH adjusted to 2.8) at flow rate of 1 mL min −1 , detection set at 215 nm, and column temperature of 40 °C. The method offers short run time, linearity in the range of 0.01—200 μM concentration for both compounds ( R 2 = 1), low limits of detection and quantification (GSH: 0.18 μM and 0.56 μM, GSSG: 0.52 μM and 1.58 μM, respectively), precision, accuracy (bias &lt; 2%), and high reproducibility. Through suitable sample handling, an overestimation of GSSG was prevented. High recovery (&gt;99%) was achieved. The method was successfully applied for the analysis of GSH and GSSG in liver homogenates of Wistar rats intraperitoneally exposed to cadmium (Cd) (1 mg kg −1 CdCl 2 /21 days). Regardless of other Cd-mediated hepatotoxicity mechanisms, herein, we have exclusively interpreted/emphasized oxidative GSH depletion. The presented method is acceptable for a routine analysis of GSH and GSSG in biological matrix, while the calculated ratio GSSG—GSH is considered as a valuable OS marker.",

It is rich in levodopa, a medicinal substance used to treat Parkinson's disease. Levodopa produced by chemical synthesis is expensive and causes various side effects. Therefore, it is recommended to use natural levodopa sources to prevent possible side effects. A Central Composite Design technique has been used in this study to optimize levodopa extraction from Vicia faba . First, a single factor analysis examined 3 variables such as extraction temperature, extraction time, and concentration of acetic acid. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of variables chosen on levodopa's extraction performance. By using variance and regression analyses, a second-order regression equation was determined as a predicted model. The value of R 2 is 0.9882, which shows that the equation fits well. The best conditions are as follows: a temperature of 59.85 °C, an extraction time of 18.74 min, and an acetic acid content of 0.28%. Under optimum conditions, the maximum levodopa yield calculated from the predicted module was 4.53%. Extraction efficiency was determined as 4.54% experimentally under optimum conditions. A good relationship has been found between the experimental result and the predicted value.",

The volatile flavor constituents of the unique plants were analyzed through headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) using capillary gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS). The volatile compounds exhibited high chemodiversity, with 10-undecenal as the major component in leaves (44.98%) and branches (57.43%). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy identified eight major peaks grouped into six main regions. Chemo profiles of these two corianders were overlapped and showed similar area differences in the spectral peak. The lesser-known perennial Eryngium with high chemodiversity would be a better alternative to the seasonal coriander for aromatic, pharmaceutical, and industrial uses.",

This research endeavors to align with the tenets of green chemistry by seamlessly integrating Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) with RP-HPLC, replacing environmentally hazardous chemical modifiers with eco-friendly solvents. Identifying the critical variables as the 70% ethanol level and flow rate, a central composite design is applied for optimization.

Green assessment methodologies are implemented to gauge the adherence of the proposed RP-HPLC method to eco-friendly principles while ensuring efficiency in chromatographic performance. The current developed method is rapid with retention time of 2.3 and 3.3 min for AM and IRB respectively and having a wide linear range from 55 to 130 μg mL −1 , which makes the suitable for the accurate quantification of AM and IRB simultaneously in bulk and tablet dosage form, there by minimize environmental impact by providing a conscientious choice for the routine analysis which is achieved through the amalgamation of AQbD with a sustainable approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract People are consuming increasing amounts of poultry eggs and their products, and their safety is always a public concern. However, the complex composition of poultry eggs and their products, particularly the proteins and lipids, can easily cause matrix effects, requiring the use of sorbents to remove these components to avoid affecting the detection results. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is a MOF material with high specific surface area, high porosity, and high stability, making it widely used as a sorbent in pesticide residue detection. In this study, we evaluated the performance of ZIF-8 compared to classic solid phase extraction (SPE) and Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) in the pretreatment step. The results showed that ZIF-8 could better reduce the matrix effect in poultry eggs and their products. After optimizing the extraction solvents, chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions, and pretreatment processes, we established a method using ZIF-8 as a sorbent combined with high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for the detection of 80 pesticide residues in seven different types of poultry eggs and their products, yielding satisfactory results. All the target analytes showed good linearity, both with values of r 2 &gt; 0.996. The average recovery and coefficients of variation (CVs), expressed as relative standard deviations, ranges from 72.5% to 113.2% (chicken egg) (CV: 0.1%–12.9%), 72.2%–114.2% (salted duck egg) (CV: 0.1%–9.8%), 70.3%–105.6% (goose egg) (CV: 0.1%–12.0%), 70.9–120.4% (marinated egg) (RSD: 0.1%–14.8%), 70.7%–108.5% (duck egg) (CV: 0.1%–12.3%), 71.1%–105.0% (quail egg) (CV: 0.2%–5.6%), 70.7%–111.5% (century egg) (CV: 0.1%–13.4%).

    "abstract": "The proteins are the controllers of all cell functions and, as such, are closely connected with many diseases and metabolic processes. Although proteins are coded by genes, it has been shown there is a poor correlation between protein and mRNA abundance [1]. For this reason a full knowledge of the genome is not sufficient for determination of the protein composition of cells [2]. This ineffectiveness of genomics caused a big shift of interest from genomics to proteomics. The main analytical tool used for protein separation in proteomics is two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) [3,4]. This technique separates proteins according to their masses and charges. These independent attributes enable separations of thousands of proteins in a single analysis. After separation all proteins can be identified by mass spectroscopy. In studies performed to identify specific proteins related to a given metabolic process or disease it is, however, much more efficient to detect and identify only proteins differentiating groups of samples [5]. In comparative studies of biological material a large number of analyses must be conducted to suppress natural differences and to increase differences related to process being studied. This results in a huge amount of data to be analyzed and generates a need for a rapid, efficient and fully automated method for matching and comparing gel images. The images may differ significantly and also contain noise of different characteristics and a varying baseline (Fig. 1). This necessitates careful preprocessing, i.e. noise and background removal. Signal noise hampers spot detection with methods based on signal derivatives, because they magnify the noise, causing identification of false peaks (spots) and incorrect determination of the borders of spots. In turn, varying signal background interferes with methods based on histogram segmentation and thresholding [6]. The background component is added to the",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY Simple, rapid, and precise densitometric TLC methods have been established for simultaneous determination of loratadine and preservatives in loratadine–sodium benzoate and loratadine–methylparaben–propylparaben mixtures. Chromatography was performed on aluminium plates precoated with silica gel 60 F254. The mobile phases were n-butyl acetate–carbon tetrachloride–acetic acid–acetonitrile 3:6:0.2:3 (v/v) for loratadine–sodium benzoate mixtures and ethyl acetate–n-hexane–methanol–ammonia– diethylamine 1:4:0.8:0.4:2 (v/v) for loratadine–methylparaben–propylparaben mixtures. Chromatographic zones were scanned in reflectance–absorbance mode at 240 nm for the former mixture and 275 nm for the latter. Relationships between peak areas and amounts of the compounds were evaluated by linear regression analysis in the concentration ranges 0.3–0.7 µg per band for loratadine, methylparaben, and sodium benzoate and 0.03– 0.07 µg per band for propylparaben. Mean recovery for all the compounds varied from 98.3 to 102.5 %. Detection and quantification limits ranged from 0.004 to 0.03 and from 0.01 to 0.1 µg per band, respectively. The proposed method was used for simultaneous determination of loratadine and the preservatives in commercial medicinal syrups.",

A C18 column was used with a 60:40 (v/v) mixture of methanol and ammonium acetate (0.1 m, pH 5, adjusted with orthophosphoric acid) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min−1. UV detection was performed at 319 nm. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, specificity and sensitivity in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. The method was successfully used for quantitative analysis of Ranipas-DV tablets. Total run time was 10 min, drotaverine and omeprazole were eluted with retention times of 7.969 and 6.538 min respectively. Validation revealed that the method is specific, accurate, precise, reliable and reproducible. Calibration plots were linear over the concentration ranges 5–40 μg mL−1 for drotaverine and 5–50 μg mL−1 for omeprazole, respectively. Limits of detection were 16.2 and 4.8 ng mL−1 and limits of quantification were 49.0 and 14.5 ng mL−1 for drotaverine and omeprazole, respectively.

The profile of VSM in the endophyte-free Mediterranean F. arundinacea germplasm was similar to that of endophyte-free Continental F. arundinacea germplasm. However, the VSM profile in AR542-infected Mediterranean F. arundinacea was different to that in AR542-infected Continental F. arundinacea. Compound 1, identified as N-acetylnorloline, was detected in AR542-infected Mediterranean F. arundinacea as being sevenfold greater compared with its level in AR542-infected Continental F. arundinacea. Levels of compounds 2, 4, and 5 detected in AR542-infected Mediterranean F. arundinacea were significantly lower when compared with their levels in the AR542-infected Continental F. arundinacea. Levels of compound 3 were similar in both germplasms infected with endophyte strain AR542. The levels of compounds 2, 4, and 5 but not compound 3 were different between AR542 infected and endophyte free depending on germplasm. On the basis of the mass spectra obtained, compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 were identified as tridecanoic acid methyl ester, n-capric acid, 11, 14, 17-eicosatrienoic acid, and linoleic acid ethyl ester, respectively. Our results highlight key differences between the Mediterranean and Continental germplasms. Comparison of the VSM of AR542-infected Mediterranean F. arundinacea with AR542-infected Continental F. arundinacea showed that there are quantitative differences between the two germplasms. These differences, which may impact on grazing systems involving horses, most probably arose as a result of intrinsic genetic differences between the two germplasms and are yet to be indentified.",

The flow rate was set at 0.3 mL min−1 with a detection wavelength of 239 nm. The method was validated over the concentration ranges from 6.5 to 15.0 μg mL−1 for hydrochlorothiazide, from 5.0 to 12 μg mL−1 for amlodipine besylate and from 76.5 to 178.5 μg mL−1 for valsartan. Calibration plots were linear for valsartan, amlodipine besylate, and hydrochlorothiazide with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99. Relative variation coefficients for repeatability and reproducibility were less than 3.0%. Recoveries from standard addition essay of individual component in pharmaceutical formulations were varied from 97.0% to 102.0%. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of valsartan, amlodipine besylate, and hydrochlorothiazide in pharmaceutical formulations with recoveries with respect to label amount in pharmaceutical formulations that varied from 98.0% to 102.9%. The low flow rate, short analysis time, and simple mobile phase composition make the method cost effective, rapid, nontedious, and successfully employed for simultaneous determination of these drugs in commercial pharmaceutical products.",

    "abstract": "Rhizome extracts of Hedychium coronarium are widely used as phytotherapeutics. As of date, there is no documented study on the standardization of H. coronarium extract, and the following research is an effort in this direction. Coronarin D is an important bioactive compound present in H. coronarium which shows chemopreventive activity against cancer. H. coronarium extracts were assessed for coronarin D content for the first time. The extraction was checked using different solvents: n -hexane, acetone, and methanol. Coronarin D was separated on silica gel 60F 254 high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates by isocratic gradient method using n -hexane-ethyl acetate (80:20 v/v ) as mobile phase. Densitometric quantification was performed at 231 nm in absorption mode. This method gave a well-defined peak at R f 0.20 corresponding to coronarin D. The method was validated using International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines in terms of precision, repeatability, and accuracy. Linearity range of coronarin D was 200–1000 ng spot −1 with a correlation coefficient of R 2 ± SD = 0.9987 ± 2.62% in the concentration range of 200–1000 ng spot −1 . The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were found to be 35 and 115 ng, respectively. Accuracy of the method was checked by recovery studies conducted at three different concentration levels, and the average percentage recovery was found to be 98.22 % for coronarin D. Among the different solvents, acetone produced maximum extraction efficiency of coronarin D. The proposed HPTLC method can be applied for robust identification and quantitative determination of coronarin D in H. coronarium extracts.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a novel reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for efficient separation of ivabradine and its 11 impurities. Similar polarity of impurities in the sample mixture made method optimization challenging and accomplishable only when different chemometric tools, such as principal component analysis (PCA), Box–Behnken design (BBD), and desirability function as a multicriteria approach, were employed. The presence of 3 positional isomers (impurities III, V, and VI), keto–enol tautomerism of impurity VII, and diastereoisomers of impurity X made separation of this complex mixture even more challenging. Chromatographic retention parameters obtained with the mobile phase consisting of 30 mM phosphate buffer and acetonitrile (80:20, v/v) on four different RP-HPLC columns at varying pH values (3.0, 4.0, and 5.0) were subjected to the PCA analysis to select the column with the most appropriate selectivity. Then the column temperature, pH of the aqueous component of mobile phase, phosphate buffer molarity and the organic solvent content in the mobile phase were estimated employing BBD. Valid and reliable mathematical models towards resolution of twelve critical peak pairs were obtained. After determination of the desirability making criteria for all responses, desirability functions were established and used in optimization. The proposed optimal chromatographic conditions included the Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 chromatographic column (100 × 4.6 mm, 3.5 μm), the column temperature of 34 °C, the mobile phase flow rate of 1.6 mL min −1 and the UV detection at 220 nm. The mobile phase consisted of the 28 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 and acetonitrile (85:15, v/v). Separation of one pair of positional isomers was not achieved, so methanol was added to the organic part of mobile phase in small increments with the optimal ratio of methanol to acetonitrile 59:41, v/v. The overall organic component of the mobile phase also increased to 18%, accelerating the chromatographic analysis.",

To profile the flavonoids in the complex BLE, a rapid and sensitive analytical method based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was developed for the structural identification of the flavonoids in Bambusa chungii leaves extract using accurate mass measurements and characteristic fragmentation patterns. After separation on an Agilent SB-C18 Rapid Resolution High Definition (RRHD) column (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 1.8 μm) by gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile as the mobile phase, the sample was analysed by ESI-QTOF-MS/MS in the negative mode. A total of 22 flavonoids were detected, and eight of these were identified by comparison with reference standards, while the other fourteen were tentatively identified according to their MS/MS data. The main fragmentation pathways of flavonoid C -glycosides (compounds 1, 5 and 10), flavonoid di- C,O -glycosides (compound 4), flavonoid di- C -glycosides (compound 7) and flavonoid C,O -di-glycosides (compounds 2 and 14) are shown in this article. This is the first report on the analysis of the flavonoids in the extract of B. chungii leaves.

Detection was carried out with λ excitation/ λ emission of 220 and 307 nm, respectively. The method was applied to detect the two binary mixtures in real plasma samples after invivo application to rats, to assure that the drugs’ metabolites do not affect the sensitivity or selectivity of the assay. Evaluation of greenness of the proposed method was done using semi-quantitative Eco‐Scale and new Green Analytical Procedure Index which showed that this method can be a greener alternative with higher sensitivity for analysis of both mixtures. The method (15 min-assay) was linear over concentrations of 0.1–10 μg/mL and 0.1–33 μg/mL in plasma.

Methods An easy HPLC-Photodiode-Array Detection (PDA) method was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of nicotine and cotinine levels in plasma of 15 rats (10 rats after tobacco products exposure and 5 control rats). Nicotine and cotinine were extracted in one step from plasma using acetonitrile and concentrated to lowest volume using nitrogen stream. Results The developed method offered a rapid analysis time of 14 min with single step of analytes extraction from rat's plasma with recovery percentage range between 93 and 95% and excellent linearity with correlation factor more than 0.994 with analytical range between 50 and 1000 ng mL −1 and LOD of 25 ng mL −1 and 23 ng mL −1 for nicotine and cotinine, respectively.

They have become part of the traditional food as human diet and used in folk medicine to treat diseases. They are very rich in terms of nutraceuticals. Melatonin is a natural hormone providing several benefits for human health. It has functions such as regulating growth and development and increasing tolerance to environmental stress factors in plants. It is stated that the serum melatonin level in humans increases after intake of foods containing melatonin. This study examined the presence of melatonin in wild grown cornelian cherry fruits by UFLC-FD and determined suitable extraction and chromatographic conditions. The optimum mobile phase, excitation/emission wavelength, and extraction solvent were determined as methanol: water: acetic acid, 275/345 nm, and methanol: water: HCl, respectively. Melatonin content in fruits ranged from 130.82 to 201.84 ng g −1 in fresh fruit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Osimertinib (Tagrisso, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) is the inaugural third-generation irreversible EGFR-TKI that specifically targets both the EGFR T790M resistant mutation and EGFR-TKI-sensitizing mutations. On September 25, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration authorized osimertinib (OSM) for adult patients with locally advanced, unresectable (stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The target of this work was to establish a fast, accurate, environmentally friendly, and highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS methodology for detecting OSM levels in human liver microsomes (HLMs). The separation of OSM and zanubrutinib (ZNB) was accomplished utilizing a C8 column and an isocratic mobile phase. The linearity of the OSM calibration curve spanned from 1 to 3,000 ng mL −1 . The AGREE score of 0.76 validates the efficacy of the current approach. The brief in vitro half-life (23.72 min) and moderate intrinsic clearance (34.18 mL min −1 kg −1 ) of OSM indicate that it resembles drugs with a moderate extraction ratio. The present LC-MS/MS technique is regarded as the primary analytical methodology for quantifying OSM in HLM matrices. The characterization of OSM metabolic stability and in silico ADME features are crucial for progressing the discovery of novel drugs with improved metabolic stability.",

Nonetheless, it is laborious, lengthy, and necessitates substantial amounts of chemicals. This study aims to develop and validate the dot-blot assay with AlCl 3 reagent for determining TFC in plant materials. In this method, the samples were not subjected to chromatography; instead, the plates were derivatized using AlCl 3 in ethanol immediately after the application of samples and evaporation the solvent. The Al(III)-flavonoid complex was scanned (421 nm) using a TLC-scanner. The validation of the method was conducted on stability, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, accuracy, and robustness. The TFC of samples determined by dot-blot assay and spectrophotometry was subsequently analyzed using linear regression and Pearson correlation. The dot-blot assay for determining TFC met the stability parameter (RSD = 1.31–8.25%), intraday precision (RSD = 2.20–6.11%), inter day precision (RSD = 1.56%), linearity ( r 2 = 0.9928), LOD (251.03 ng/spot), LOQ (760.71 ng/spot), accuracy (recovery = 70.81–75.61%), and robustness (RSD = 2.55 and 7.60%). There was a very strong positive linear relationship between the dot-blot assay method and spectrophotometry, with a linear regression coefficient of 0.9078 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.911. The proposed method proved to be simpler, faster, and more economical for determining TFC.

    "abstract": "Abstract ASP3026 is a recently formulated and highly selective inhibitor designed to target the ALK kinase. ASP3026 efficiently inhibited ALK kinase activity and demonstrated superior selectivity at a panel of Tyr-kinases compared to crizotinib. The target of this investigation was to establish a highly accurate, fast, green, and highly sensitive Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography- Tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) technique for assessing the concentration of ASP3026 in human liver microsomes (HLMs). In vitro incubation, the metabolic stability of ASP3026 in HLMs was evaluated using this known approach. The validation steps for the UHPLC-MS/MS analytical technique in the HLMs were performed along with the bio-analytical method validation guidelines settled by the US-FDA. To increase the ecological sustainability of the current UHPLC-MS/MS system, a lower flow rate of 0.3 mL min −1 , a shorter elution duration of 1 min, and a reduced consumption of ACN have been implemented. A screening of the chemical structure of ASP3026 for hazardous alerts and metabolic lability was performed by the StarDrop package, that includes the DEREK and P450 modules. The analytical separation of ASP3026 and fenebrutinib (FNB) on the reversed phase Eclipse Plus C18 column was performed using an isocratic mobile phase approach. The calibration curve produced by the ASP3026 showed a linear association over the level range of 1–3,000 ng mL −1 . A study was conducted to evaluate the precision and accuracy of UHPLC-MS/MS technology in evaluating both intra-day and inter-day variations. The accuracy exhibited a range of −1.56%–7.33% across various days, and a range of −0.78%–10.66% within the same day. The ASP3026 underwent in vitro half-life and intrinsic clearance measurements, yielding values of 14.32 min and 56.62 mL min −1 kg −1 , correspondingly. According to in silico software research, using minor modifications to the piperazine component or substituting the group in drug design has the potential to improve the metabolic safety and stability of novel derivatives in comparison to ASP3026.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since the last few decades, the TLC has been an essential tool in the standardization and quality control of herbal medicines. Often, the traditional Thin Layer Chromatographic (t-TLC) profiling is inadequate in separating and identifying the huge numbers of phytochemicals present therein. A simple t-TLC is unable to accommodate or separate such large numbers of spots or bands on a plate. The present investigation has tried to adopt multidimensional and multiple development methods in combination to separate 21 phytochemicals and to generate a decisive chromatographic fingerprint of the sample. The most exciting point is that the qualitative profile generated here is highly reproducible for 19 phytocompounds. The limitations of traditional TLC in separating and identifying were overcome by the present investigation. The output of the present study may be an example of creating herboprint, which is generic and conclusive in the qualitative identification of complex herbal formulations. The most significant output of this work is that the presence or absence of any herb in a polyherbal formulation can easily be detected. It generates a unique herboprint, which can be referred as an authentic chromatographic fingerprint of the complex formulation. The concept adopted here is not new in the domain of TLC, but here maximized improvisation has been imposed in the field of herbs and herbal formulations. Significantly, a concept of coordinate position(s) which has been introduced is more rational than R f value(s) for qualitative profiling in multidimensional development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Three techniques (UPLC, LC-MS/MS, and GC-MS) were developed to detect and evaluate various types of impurities in the trimetazidine API molecule. The UPLC method was developed to investigate simultaneously the nine process related impurities (IMP ‘A’ to ‘I’), GC-MS method was developed to quantify N-nitrosopiperazine and 1,4 dinitrosopiperazine simultaneously and LC-MS method for N-nitrosotrimetazidine quantification. Every studied impurity had good linear calibration curves over the concentration ranges of LOQ to 150% of the test sample concentration. The developed approaches exhibited the ability to quantify investigated impurities with great sensitivity, as seen by the LOQ values obtained, which were much below the impurity specification limits. The specificity, linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and robustness of the devised approaches were all validated in conformity with ICH guidance. There was also discussion on the potential mechanism for the N-nitrosotrimetazidine synthesis. This investigation showed that the established techniques (UPLC, LC-MS/MS, and GC-MS) for various forms of impurities in the trimetazidine API molecule may be utilised for quality control, as mandated by regulatory bodies to guarantee the product's safety in addition to effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study explores the influence of different counterions (K + , Na + , NH 4 + ) on the retention behavior of protonated basic solutes in chaotropic chromatography with hexafluorophosphate (PF 6 − ) in the mobile phase. The effects were analyzed at varying PF 6 − concentrations and pH values, with experiments conducted at constant ionic strength using corresponding chloride salts (NaCl, KCl, NH 4 Cl) for consistency. Results show that counterions significantly impact the surface potential (Ψ 0 ), affecting retention and elution sequences, enabling optimized separation. An empirical retention model, considering analyte structure and mobile phase composition, was applied. For solutes existing entirely as monocations, retention is primarily influenced by interactions with the electrical double layer on the stationary phase, regardless of ionic strength or pH. However, when analytes exhibit varying ionization states, both electrical double layer interactions and ion pairing with the chaotropic anion affect retention. This study underscores the potential of chaotropic chromatography for versatile separations of protonated basic analytes through careful selection of counterions and chaotropic anions. These findings enhance understanding of retention mechanisms, optimize chromatographic performance, and support the development of advanced analytical methods.",

The gold standard for quantification of coenzyme Q10 is the use of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Before the instrumental quantification of CoQ10, a careful and complex sample preparation is required. There are several reported variations between sample preparation methods in the literature. The online database PubMed was searched for published HPLC methods for the quantification of CoQ10 through May 2024. We included publications describing a HPLC method with UV detection for the quantification in human blood, serum and plasma. 328 reports were screened from the database PubMed. Thereof, 19 methods to quantify coenzyme Q10 were selected and summarized in a table presenting the sample preparation procedure, HPLC settings and reporting of quality criteria. Three reports were rated as having high quality and their methods are presented in detail and compared with each other. This report provides a tabular overview of the various sample preparation options for the quantification of coenzyme Q10 in human blood samples (plasma, serum) using HPLC in combination with a UV detector. It enables the user to screen methods for similarities and differences and represents a tool for method development and method establishment to quantify coenzyme Q10 in a laboratory.",

Studies have shown that Huatuodou have obvious anti-inflammatory effects, and concluded that neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid C may be the pharmacodynamic substances. Its quality has not been extensively evaluated in spite of its anti-inflammatory. The main objective of this study was to establish a quality control method of one-measurement-multiple-assessment method (QAMS) for Huatuodou, and to investigate the accuracy and applicability of this method by comparing it with the external standard method. In this study, the contents of seven components, namely chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B and isochlorogenic acid C, were simultaneously determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The relative correction factors (f S/i ) of the other six components were calculated using the multipoint correction method with chlorogenic acid as the internal reference, and the differences between the results of the QAMS method and those of the external standard method were compared to verify the accuracy of the QAMS method. The results showed that all the f S/i values had good applicability (RSD&lt;5%) under different column temperatures, column, flow rate and different instruments, and there was no significant difference between the quantitative results of the seven components in Huatuodou from 10 origins under different quantitative methods. The applicability and feasibility of the QAMS method established in this study were evaluated to be favorable for the quality control of Huatuodou.",

The impurity profiling/related substances UPLC approach for quantification of six FMTR related substances (FMTR-RS-1 to FMTR-RS-6) and FMTR simultaneously in low dosage (10 μg mL −1 ) FMTR inhalation formulation was developed for the first time. Chromatographic separation of FMTR and six FMTR related substances was accomplished on Acquity BEH C18 column. The elution process involved a gradient program with phosphate buffer (pH 2.8) and acetonitrile as solvents of mobile phase at a flow speed of 0.3 mL min −1 . With a 20-min run time, the FMTR and six FMTR-related substances were monitored and quantified at 214 nm. Selectivity, precision, robustness, linearity, ruggedness, sensitivity and accuracy were all evaluated in order to confirm that the procedure satisfied ICH Q2 (R2) criteria. The method revealed good sensitivity with low LOQ values (0.0212–0.0279 μg mL −1 ), better linearity with R 2 of &gt; 0.999, satisfactory recoveries (88.941%–108.251%) in accuracy and less than 5% RSD in precision for FMTR and six FMTR-related substances. FMTR inhalation formulation was stressed under multiple stress conditions, such as heat, oxidation, photolysis, humidity lysis, base hydrolysis, and acid hydrolysis. Importantly, the impurities produced throughout stress investigations did not interfere with the UPLC procedure for FMTR assay, providing great specific outcomes and stability indicating nature. Two stability testing batches of FMTR inhalation formulation were evaluated deploying the newly established UPLC analytical approach. The FMTR-RS-1 was the major impurity identified in both real-time stability samples and all degradation investigations, except oxidation degradation. The established approach revealed its applicability and potential benefits to the pharmaceutical industry by enabling the quality control department to quickly quantify the impurity profile and analyse FMTR in inhalation dosage forms without compromising quality parameters.",

This study was centered on the development and validation of a UPLC-MS/MS technique for quantifying isotalatizidine concentrations in rat plasma, as well as investigating its pharmacokinetic characteristics. Midazolam served as the internal standard (IS), and plasma samples were processed through protein precipitation using acetonitrile. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a UPLC BEH C18 column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid under gradient elution conditions. Detection was achieved via electrospray ionization (ESI) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with a positive ion interface, monitoring the transitions m / z 408.5→390.5 for isotalatizidine and m / z 326.2→291.4 for the IS. The calibration curve exhibited linearity within the concentration range of 1–576 ng mL −1 ( r &gt; 0.995). Both intra-day and inter-day precision values remained below 8.7%. Accuracy fell within the range of 94.9%–109.0%, while matrix effects were observed between 101.5% and 108.6%. This validated method was effectively applied to assess the pharmacokinetics of isotalatizidine after both oral and intravenous administration in rats, indicating an absolute bioavailability of 5.9%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Renowned for its heat-clearing, detoxifying, and blood-cooling properties, Viola kunawarensis is frequently conflated with various species such as Viola hediniana , Viola philippica . This study aimed to establish a comparative analysis strategy for authentic and adulterated varieties by integrating multidisciplinary techniques, with V. kunawarensis as a case study. Firstly, a characteristic chromatogram of V. kunawarensis was established, and the differences between V. kunawarensis and its adulterants were explored using similarity evaluation, HCA, PCA, and OPLS-DA. The comparative chromatographic analysis revealed substantial differences among the samples, with the similarity of authentic V. kunawarensis exceeding 0.9, whereas the similarity with adulterants ranged from 0.063 to 0.668. Network pharmacology was further used to identify the key components of V. kunawarensis : esculetin, rutin, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, guiding subsequent content determination. The analysis indicated that esculetin, rutin, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside were pivotal components of V. kunawarensis , with content s ranging from 0.0094 to 14.1067 mg g −1 for esculetin, 0.0404 to 1.3030 mg g −1 for rutin, and 0.0409 to 2.0681 mg g −1 for kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, respectively. The quality of V. kunawarensis was not significantly influenced by geographical origins, but significant variations in component content were observed among the different varieties, with kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside emerging as the primary discriminant component. Finally, to predict the content of these components in various medicinal material varieties, an RBF model was developed. The RBF model exhibited strong predictive capabilities, with the most accurate predictions for kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, followed by rutin and esculetin. This research provides a comparative analysis framework for the authentic and adulterated varieties of medicinal herbs. Additionally, it provides a reference for quality control of V. kunawarensis in the market and lays a research foundation for its clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cognitive and cerebrovascular disorders, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and ischemic stroke, present significant global health challenges, particularly in aging populations. These conditions are characterized by cognitive decline and reduced cerebral blood flow, necessitating therapeutic strategies that address both aspects. Piracetam (PCM), a nootropic agent, enhances memory, learning, and neuroprotection. Vincamine (VCM), a cerebral vasodilator, improves blood flow and oxygen utilization. Their combination offers a synergistic approach to managing dementia impairment with vascular insufficiency. We evaluated RP-HPLC using AGREEprep and ComplexGAPI. PCM and VCM were measured concurrently in pharmaceutical formulations using RP-HPLC to ensure quality, safety, and efficacy. The process offered excellent linearity over a concentration range of 3–50 μg mL −1 for each drug, with coefficients of determination ( R 2 ) of 0.999. High sensitivity was achieved, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.93 μg mL −1 for VCM and 0.32 μg mL −1 for PCM, and limits of quantitation (LOQ) of 2.81 μg mL −1 and 0.90 μg mL −1 . Accuracy studies revealed recoveries close to 100% for both drugs, with intra-day and inter-day precision showing RSD ≤2. System suitability parameters met pharmacopeial standards. Dissolution testing in media at pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8 revealed pH-dependent release of VCM, with 95.10% dissolution at pH 1.2 and 72% at pH 6.8 after 60 min. In contrast, PCM exhibited rapid and complete dissolution (&gt;95% within 5 min) across all pH levels, consistent with its high solubility. These results validate the method as reliable for quality control and dissolution testing. This supports the development of this promising combination for cognitive and cerebrovascular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cottonseed is the second source of protein in the World after soybeans and the fifth in oil production. The most important use of cottonseed is in human and animal nutrition. Apart from this, the shell of cottonseed can be used in the cellulose industry and its inner part can be used as a medical drug due to its gossypol content. Gossypol is a phenolic compound that is a triterpenoid aldehyde or polyphenolic binaphtyl aldehyde. Gossypol has toxic and anti-fertility effects. For this reason, the gossypol substance contained in its seeds classifies its use in human and animal nutrition as a source of both protein and fat. The main goal of this work was to develop a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for measuring the amount of gossypol in different commercially available cotton oil samples that is rapid, straightforward, and accurate. Prior to chromatographic separation, liquid-liquid extraction was used for the preparation of samples, which is now the predominant extraction technique due to its simplicity, speed, and efficiency. Reversed phase C18 (5 µm × 4.6 mm × 150 mm) analytical column, methanol and water (0.1% o -phosphoric acid) (90:10 v/v) at a flow rate of 1.1 mL min −1 , and a UV detector that detected at 620 nm were used to achieve the chromatographic separation. The linear behaviour of the proposed approach was examined in the 0.01–30 μg mL −1 range ( r 2 = 0.9999). The proposed method is in alignment with the criteria that is established by International Conference on Hormonisation (ICH) about the accuracy, precision, repeatability, specificity, robustness and detection and quantification. Limit of detection and limit of quantification are determined to be 0.003 and 0.01 μg mL −1 whereas relative standard deviation was determined to be less than 1.03% for daily and hourly measurements. For stability tests, the highest RSD value among all conditions was found to be 3.44%. The method is an effective way of approach towards the detection of gossypol in different commercially available cotton oil samples. The suggested analytical process is a productive way to measure and regularly analyse gossypol in different commercially available cotton oil samples.",

These conditions included the thin-layer plate, the composition of the mobile phase, and the scanning wavelength. Concurrently, the HPLC fingerprints were established, and a similarity analysis of 10 batches of samples was conducted using a similarity evaluation system. This analysis revealed that the samples within each batch exhibited a high degree of similarity, suggesting that the compositions were characterized by a high degree of consistency. Furthermore, the spectral characteristics of Airfs were explored by analyzing them through three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Roxadustat is a HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated anemia. Approved in 2018, it has become a drug of great interest to researchers. In addition to its primary indication, roxadustat also exhibits cholesterol-lowering properties, even in patients who are not consuming lipid-lowering agents. The drug inhibits the HIF prolyl-hydroxylase enzyme, which increases iron uptake, reduces hepcidin levels, and promotes erythropoietin production. To facilitate reliable analysis of roxadustat, a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed. This method ensures precision and reproducibility while offering improved temperature control, reducing potential fluctuations in results compared to previously reported methods. Results The HPLC method was developed on the Shimadzu HPLC system, equipped with a CTO-20AC oven and a DGU-20ASR photodiode array detector. The method employed a C-18 column (5 mm × 250 cm with a 0.5 µm particle size) and used a mobile phase consisting of ethanol and water (80:20 v/v). The flow rate was set at 0.8 mL min −1 , and the sample concentration was 150 μg mL −1 . The retention time for roxadustat was 6 min at a detection wavelength of 262 nm. Complete temperature control was ensured by maintaining the column temperature at 28 °C. Validation of the method was conducted by following ICH-Q2 guidelines. A series of tests, including linearity, precision, robustness, reproducibility, repeatability, specificity, and system suitability, were performed. For each test, the mean, standard deviation, percentage recovery, and percentage relative standard deviation (% RSD) were calculated. Additionally, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were evaluated during the validation process. Conclusion The developed HPLC method offers a reliable, precise, and reproducible approach for the qualitative analysis of roxadustat. The improved temperature control minimizes fluctuations in results, addressing limitations noted in previously reported methods. This method provides researchers with a robust tool for analyzing roxadustat with high accuracy and consistency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A broad-spectrum antibiotic known as piperacillin is often used with tazobactam to treat infections caused by anaerobic bacteria as well as different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To ensure efficacy, it is important that piperacillin must reach therapeutic levels in the blood. An optimized, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) serves as an ideal technique for accurate drug concentration analysis. In the current study, a validated reverse-phase HPLC method was developed for the determination of piperacillin in pharmaceutical formulation and human plasma. Acetonitrile was used to deproteinized the plasma samples, vortexed them, and reconstituted the supernatant with the mobile phase prior to HPLC injection. The analysis was performed by using a Waters Alliance HPLC system, which had a UV detector set at 218 nm and a flow rate of 1 mL min −1 . The mobile phase consisted of methanol, water, tetrabutylammonium chloride buffer, and phosphoric acid. The method showed linearity from 0.5 μg mL −1 to 400 μg mL −1 , with 99.9% recovery rate. The detection and quantification limits were 0.25 μg mL −1 and 0.5 μg mL −1 , respectively. The Cmax exhibits variability among patients, even when the same dose is administered to adult individuals. The method is both accurate and reliable, and the findings highlights the importance of individualized dosing based on variations in patients' plasma concentrations.",

However, its complex chemical composition necessitates the development of comprehensive quality assessment protocols to ensure consistent therapeutic efficacy. Objectives This study was designed to establish a reliable quality evaluation system for FLZX standard decoction through integrated analytical approaches, thereby facilitating quality control standardization. Methods Fifteen batches of FLZX standard decoctions were subjected to HPLC fingerprint analysis with similarity assessment. Multivariate chemometric analyses including cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were employed to evaluate origin-related variations. Characteristic peaks were identified and three major bioactive constituents were quantitatively determined. Results The established HPLC fingerprints contained eight characteristic peaks, with inter-batch similarities exceeding 0.900. Three bioactive markers (hesperidin, nitidine, and nitidine chloride) were unambiguously identified. Chemometric analysis revealed significant quality variations associated with geographical origin and harvesting period. Quantitative determination yielded concentration ranges of 0.850–3.829 mg g −1 for hesperidin, 3.612–10.251 mg g −1 for nitidine, and 0.087–0.335 mg g −1 for nitidine chloride, with corresponding transfer rates of 7.478–41.458%, 32.927–93.989%, and 3.235–17.392%, respectively. The extraction yields varied from 7.241% to 14.466%. Conclusion The combination of HPLC fingerprinting with chemometric pattern recognition establishes a robust quality assessment platform for FLZX standard decoction, providing both methodological and practical foundations for quality control in the production of related pharmaceutical preparations.",

SPEP is performed in horizontal zone electrophoresis systems with ultra-thin agarose gels or cellulose acetate membranes, or in the capillary zone electrophoresis without carrier material. Biomedical research laboratories more commonly use acrylamide gels as a carrier for protein analysis. As this is not applied for diagnostic SPEP, our study aimed to establish and characterize of an acrylamide-based SPEP with serum samples from cattle. This study showed the best electrophoretic separation of the serum protein fractions by use of concentration gradient gels (2−12% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide in Tris-acetate buffer) and Tris-taurine electrophoresis running buffer. Post-analysis of the protein bands by mass spectrometry identified those proteins contributing to the major SPEP fractions. While some proteins migrated in the expected fractions ( e.g., α1-antiproteinase, complement factor C3), others migrated elsewhere ( e.g., α2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin). In contrast to Tris-acetate/taurine buffer chemistry, Tris-borate proved to be the best buffer condition for separating the serotransferrin-containing fractions, allowing an appropriate differentiation of the individual transferrin serotypes. In summary, our study suggests electrophoresis protocols that can be used for bovine SPEP in acrylamide gels.",

These observations demonstrated that ACA and SA in the marketed enteric-coated tablet dosage forms can be consistently analyzed by using the current UPLC method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Apomorphine, a potent dopamine agonist, plays a significant role in the management of advanced Parkinson's disease, and requires careful monitoring of the drug and its impurities for safety and efficacy. The USP monograph for Apomorphine Hydrochloride currently uses classical methods—titrimetry for assay and Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) for impurity testing—which, although effective, are not comparable in accuracy and speed to newer chromatographic techniques like High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). For this, an HPLC method was developed using a C18 column, which possesses hydrophobic interaction capacity, and an isocratic elution mode with a mobile phase of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 3.0) and methanol (87.5:12.5) containing 0.075% L-tartaric acid. This combination allowed efficient separation of apomorphine from impurities without compromising stability. The method was thoroughly validated according to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and exhibited very good specificity, precision, accuracy, linearity, and robustness. The validation results demonstrated a good linear correlation ( r = 0.999) between the peak area and the apomorphine concentration, excellent precision (repeatability of 0.23% and intermediate precision of 0.56%), and accuracy (recoveries of 99.72–100.08%). Robustness was confirmed by minimal variation in percentage recovery ( R = 1.3%), and specificity was confirmed by the absence of interfering peaks caused by excipients or formulation components. The method has been successfully employed in the analysis of apomorphine and impurities in commercial products, proving itself reliable from batch to batch. This HPLC method represents a significant improvement over conventional methods, as it provides a precise and quicker approach for the quality control of apomorphine medicinal products.",

    "abstract": "Summary Identification of closely related plant species is not a trivial task, and is often difficult on the basis of morphological or anatomical features. To differentiate among analyzed species, a chromatographic fingerprint is usually constructed. This is not easy for very complex samples, however, especially those containing substances spanning a wide polarity range. In such circumstances more than one fingerprint is constructed, e.g. one for polar and the other for apolar constituents. In this paper a new method has been used for resolution of a mixture of 17 coumarins and flavonoids and, subsequently, construction of a fingerprint of closely related species belonging to the Peucedanum genus. This is the first time multidimensional planar chromatography has been applied for such purpose. Distinctive fingerprints are produced for every analyzed plant species, without the need to construct two fingerprints and without the application of more sophisticated multidimensional methods (e.g. hyphenation of HPLC and TLC, HPLC-MS, etc).",

Previously, we demonstrated that submerged cultivated mycelia of L. edodes accumulated Se from the cultivation medium very efficiently, more so than yeast. The objective of this study was to investigate the kinetics of Se accumulation by L. edodes mycelial culture. The L. edodes mycelia were cultivated in medium enriched with 20 μg mL−1 Se in a 10-L jar fermenter. Each day, a 100-mL sample was taken from the fermenter and the concentration of Se in the dried mycelia, in the filtered medium, and in the wash water was determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC). We adapted a widely used fluorimetric method based on derivatization with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene for analysis of Se for RP HPLC. Se recovery was determined on the basis of the theoretical amount of Se in the cultivation medium. To detect volatile selenium compounds released from the fermenter, the concentration of Se in the ethanol and in the activated charcoal used in the washers and exhaust filters was determined. The time-course of the Se content of dry mycelial biomass and in filtered medium indicated that the most effective accumulation of Se occurred at the beginning of the trophophase (log phase of growth), between the second and fourth days of cultivation. The Se concentration in mycelia peaked on day 7 (3041 μg g−1) and decreased thereafter in proportion to the increase in the concentration of Se in the ethanol and activated charcoal from the fermenter exhaust filters.",

Heterotheca inuloides, Citrus aurantium, Peumus boldus, Equisetum arvense, Eucalyptus globulus, Ginkgo biloba, Mentha piperita, Aloe vera, Salvia officinalis, and Cassia senna are some of the major commercial products obtained from plants in this region. In this paper we describe the effectiveness of TLC methods for quality control of several commercial products containing plants and their extracts. We used one or several specific markers for each type of plant. In only 20% of the 40 commercial products that were analysed did the chromatographic characteristics of the respective plants match those of the specific respective marker compounds. These results highlighted a problem arising from the lack of regulation of these products. The proposed TLC methods are simple, sensitive, and specific, and can be used for routine quality control of raw herbal products and formulations of the plants tested. The results obtained emphasize the need to develop simple and reliable analytical methods that can be performed in any laboratory for the purpose of quality control of dietary supplements or commercial herbal products sold in Mexico.",

    "abstract": "Summary A simple, precise, and accurate HPTLC method has been established for simultaneous quantification of aspirin, atorvastatin calcium and clopidogrel bisulphate in the bulk drug and in a capsule dosage form. Chromatographic separation of the drugs was performed on aluminium foil plates precoated with silica gel 60 F254, with toluene-methanol-formic acid 6.5:3.5:0.1 (v/v) as mobile phase. Densitometric evaluation of the separated zones was performed at 254 nm. The three drugs were satisfactorily resolved with RF ± SD values 0.26 ± 0.01, 0.47 ± 0.01, and 0.78 ± 0.01 for aspirin, atorvastatin calcium, and clopidogrel bisulphate, respectively. The method was validated for linearity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and robustness, in accordance with ICH guidelines. Results from recovery studies indicated acceptable recovery of the drugs from the capsule dosage form. The intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations were in the ranges 0.17–0.73% and 0.46–1.03% for aspirin, 0.36–0.87% and 0.44–0.62% for atorvastatin calcium, and 0.25–0.69% and 0.35–0.94% for clopidogrel bisulphate. The method proved to be a rapid and cost-effective quality-control tool for routine simultaneous analysis of aspirin, atorvastatin calcium, and clopidogrel bisulphate in the bulk drug and in a capsule formulation.",

Therefore, nowadays, more and more biological and chemical in vitro methods are developed for the drug metabolism study. This review is focused on the photocatalytic degradation of chemicals and the application of this process in chromatographic methods of drug metabolism research.

    "abstract": "Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. It contains many bioactive compounds, including chlorogenic acid which possesses various biological properties. In this study, in order to determine concentration of chlorogenic acid in green coffee, a reverse-phase rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RP-RRLC) method with diode-array detection (DAD) was developed. Successful separation was achieved on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (50 mm × 3 mm; 2.7 μm) column using acetonitrile–water with 1% phosphoric acid (10:90, v / v ) as a mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and with UV detection at 325 nm. The identification was made with comparison of the retention time of pure analytical standard with the retention time of chlorogenic acid in the analyzed samples. The developed method was validated using the following parameters: linearity, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and accuracy. Excellent linearity over the range 12.33–143.50 μg/mL was achieved with R 2 values greater than 0.99. The intra-day precision was validated with the %RSD values, which confirmed that the method for determination of chlorogenic acid was repeatable. The mean recovery rate of the method ranged between 97.87% and 106.67% with %RSD values lower than 1%. The limit of detection and limit of quantification values under the used chromatographic conditions were 0.29 and 0.96 pg, respectively.

    "abstract": "A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used to assess the concentration of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG) in rat striatum. Following decapitation, striatum was isolated from the male Wistar rat brain and immediately homogenized with double distilled water. GSH level was determined after pre-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA). The optimal incubation time with OPA was tested. The concentration of GSSG was determined after blockage the thiol groups of GSH by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The useful time for incubation with NEM was optimized. Next, disulfide bounds of GSSG were reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT), and released GSH is derivatized with OPA. The total glutathione, tGSH (sum of free and bound GSH, GSSG, and other low-molecular-mass aminothiols), was determined after reduction with DTT and then derivatization with OPA. The level of GSSG was calculated of the difference in concentrations of tGSH and GSH, but we showed that the calculated concentration of GSSG was within the range of standard deviation of the mean concentration of tGSH or GSH. Finally, the concentration of GSH was determined after 5-min incubation with OPA and the concentration of GSSG after 30-s incubation with NEM and 5-min incubation with DTT and OPA. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values obtained for the assay of GSH and GSSG were lower than 10%. The values obtained for accuracy for GSH (50–500 nM) and GSSG (0.5–5 nM) were within limits regarded as acceptable for analysis of biological samples (percent of recovery: 95–105%). Mean absolute recovery of GSH and GSSG was ranged from 97.1% to 99%. Limit of detection for GSH was 2.7 nM, and limit of quantification was 8.2 nM. Limit of detection (LOD) for GSSG is twice the value for GSH. Described method allows to determine GSH and GSSG levels in isolated rat brain structures with high level of reliability.",

The method showed linearity in a concentration range of 0.75–12.0 μg mL −1 for atenolol ( r = 0.9995), 0.30–12.00 μg mL −1 for furosemide ( r = 0.9997), 0.45–12.00 μg mL −1 for losartan ( r = 0.9995), and 0.45–12.0 μg mL −1 for spironolactone ( r = 0.9999). The method also showed repeatability and precision. The three-day average intra-day precisions were 101.35 ± 0.74% for atenolol, 95.84 ± 1.44% for furosemide, 98.90 ± 1.16% for losartan, and 97.19 ± 0.18% for spironolactone. Similarly, the inter-day precisions were 101.34 ± 0.72% for atenolol, 95.84 ± 0.1.50% for furosemide, 98.90 ± 1.17% for losartan, and 97.19 ± 0.83% for spironolactone. The method accuracy was also tested and validated — in this case, the average recovery values were 100.18 ± 1.20% for atenolol, 99.83 ± 1.54% for furosemide, 100.07 ± 0.95% for losartan, and 99.94 ± 0.93% for spironolactone. Finally, the method was successfully applied in the simultaneous determination of atenolol, furosemide, losartan, and spironolactone in magisterial formulas, as well as in commercial pharmaceutical formulations.",

The optimal adsorption conditions were determined by analyzing the effect of adsorbent dosage, adsorption time, eluent type and volume, and elution time. Under the optimal conditions, a good linearity was obtained at concentrations from 10 to 400 μg L −1 with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9991 to 0.9986. The limits of detection (LOD) for the two organochlorine pesticides were 0.025 and 0.049 μg L −1 , and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.080 and 0.156 μg L −1 , respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by measuring the recovery of the spiked samples, which ranged from 82.5% to 110.5% at spiking levels of 0.5–10 μg L −1 with relative standard deviations lower than 5.6% ( n = 6). This method was successfully applied to determine the target analytes in canal water, drinking water, and water taken from the inlets and outlets of a wastewater treatment plant. The results demonstrate that the developed method has great potential for determining the two organochlorine pesticides in water samples.",

The purpose of this study is to detect such counterfeited drugs, using a reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Analysis was divided into three phases. In the first phase, a Plackett-Burman design (PBD) was used to screen five independent factors, namely, buffer pH, buffer concentration (mM), acetonitrile content (%), flow rate (mL/min) and triethylamine (TEA) content in the buffer preparation (%). The selected dependent variables were (resolution, symmetry of peaks and run time). The objective of the second phase was to optimize the method performance using Box-Behnken design (BBD) and desirability function for multiple response optimization to obtain the best chromatographic performance with the shortest run time. Optimal chromatographic separation was achieved on a YMC-pack pro C18 ODS-A column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) at room temperature The optimum mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 5 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer containing 0.5% triethyamine (30:70, v/v) with the pH adjusted to 3.5 using an orthophosphoric acid solution. The flow rate was maintained at 1 mL/min, and the detection was performed with a fluorescence detector fixed at 380 nm (λ emission ) after excitation at 335 nm (λ excitation ). The third phase was method validation according to ICH guidelines, providing to be specific, precise, accurate, and robust. The method is linear over a range of 0.4–8 µg/mL for chloroquine and ASP, while for paracetamol it is linear over 16–48 µg/mL. The developed RP-HPLC method was used for quantitation of the three drugs in chloroquine dosage form samples. The method shows a great tendency in the classification between the genuine chloroquine and the adulterated ones in pharmaceutical preparations and breast milk.",

In this study, we used roots and herb of the plant collected in spring and autumn. The alkaloid fractions were prepared according to modified pharmacopeial procedure [1]. In our method, we performed two-step elution onto silica gel plates. The first eluent consisted of chloroform, methanol, and water mixed with 70:30:4 proportion. The second eluent comprised of toluene, ethyl acetate, and methanol with 83:15:2 proportion. The described thin-layer chromatography (TLC) system allows qualitative and quantitative determination of the following alkaloids: sanguinarine, chelerythrine, chelidonine, coptisine, and berberine. For determination of protopine, eluent with n -buthanol, acetic acid, and water in 15:1.5:4 proportion was investigated. The dominant alkaloids observed in studied fractions were coptisine (1027.096 ± 13.367–287.474 ± 3.069 mg/100 g dry matter ± sdv) and chelidonine (1780.667 ± 263.522– 115.929 ± 14.694 mg/100 g dry matter ± sdv). The alkaloid detected in the least amount was chelerythrine (30.74 ± 7.526–1.143 ± 0.0651 mg/100 g dry matter ± sdv). The highest total amount of all alkaloids was determined in the fractions obtained from herbs in spring, and the lowest amount was detected in herbs autumn. Additionally, we compared amounts of studied alkaloids in different parts of plants (aerial parts and roots). The plants were collected in spring and autumn. Authors concluded that the presented method can be used as a valuable tool for screening studies on C. majus L.",

The development and implementation of cost-effective, efficient and quick analytical methods to control the quality of these medicines is one of the immediate strategies to avoid such a situation. Hence, the main goal of this study was to develop and validate a simple, specific and precise new RP–HPLC method for simultaneous analysis of amoxicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin in pharmaceutical formulations. The chromatographic analysis was achieved using Shodex C 18 (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column with UV detection at 225 nm. The mobile phase was a gradient mixture of 30 mM phosphate buffer, pH 4.0 (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B).

The developed method was validated for its specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness as per the ICH guidelines. The validation results showed that the method was specific, linear, precise, accurate and robust for the simultaneous determination of the three drugs. The developed method was applied to determine the content of the three drugs in pharmaceutical formulations. The assay results of the preparations showed that their drug content was within the pharmacopeial limit stipulated for each drug product.

A capillary with an internal diameter of 75 µm and an effective length of 40 cm was used for separation. The optimum conditions were achieved using 35 mM SDS, 6 mM borate, 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 9.00) containing 5% isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and applying a potential of 15 kV. Under these conditions, the migration times of ZNS, RFN and LMT were observed to be 5.99 min, 6.77 min and 8.46 min, respectively. In HPLC method, detection was achieved using a photodiode array detector at a wavelength of 210 nm. A C18 column (4.6 × 100.0 mm, 3.5 µm i.d.) was used for separation, with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and pH 4.0 50 mM phosphate buffer (18:82, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min −1 . In this method, the retention times of ZNS, RFN and LMT were observed to be 6.41 min, 7.29 min and 4.95 min, respectively. The validity of the developed methods was examined through parameters such as linearity, precision, accuracy, sensitivity, stability, and robustness. In CE method, the limit of detection (LOD) values for ZNS, RFN and LMT were calculated as 0.035 μg mL −1 , 0.016 μg mL −1 and 0.007 μg mL −1 , respectively. For HPLC method, the LOD values were determined as 0.003 μg mL −1 , 0.002 μg mL −1 for RFN and 0.001 μg mL −1 for LMT. Both developed methods were successfully applied to pharmaceutical dosage forms and shown to be compliant with United States Pharmacopeia (USP 47 - NF 42). In conclusion, both methods developed in our study yielded comparable results in terms of robustness and analysis time. HPLC demonstrated higher sensitivity compared to CE and is preferred for analyses at very low concentrations, while CE is ideal for green chemistry applications due to its minimal solvent and sample consumption.",

After at least two systemic treatments failed for chronic graft-versus-host disease in adults and children aged 12 and older, belumosudil (BLS) was approved on July 16, 2021. This study established a validated Ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) system to estimate BLS in HLMs and assess metabolic stability. Agilent C18 column was used to separate BLS and encorafenib (internal standard) in HLMs using an isocratic mobile phase. The electrospray ionization (ESI) source produced BLS parent ions. Multiple reaction monitoring identified and measured BLS daughter ions. The methodology was validated following FDA standards that assessed linearity, selectivity, accuracy, sensitivity, precision, extraction recovery, matrix effects, and stability. The accuracy and precision ranged from −1.42 to 12.50% between days and from −0.89 to 10.5% within a day. The created BLS calibration curve displayed a linearity in the range from 1 ng mL −1 to 3,000 ng mL −1 . The LLOQ of 0.64 ng mL −1 showed the method's sensitivity. The AGEE program displayed that the approach was eco-friendly. In vitro half-life and intrinsic clearance of BLS were 17.55 min and 46.21 mL min −1 kg −1 , demonstrating a high extraction ratio drug. These features can improve the metabolic stability of new derivatives compared to BLS, making them important in medication design.",

It belongs to class II, according to the biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS), which is characterized by low solubility and high permeability. Considering the literature, the drug presents more than one polymorphic form impacting its solubility and release. The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of others physical parameters on the intrinsic dissolution rate of the same form. For this, samples obtained from different manufacturers with the same form I which was confirmed by IR-TF, DRX and DSC techniques, were studied. Their physical proprieties consisting of morphology structures and pore sizes distribution were studied by SEB and laser technics, respectively. Our results showed that the IDR determination for eleven samples on four pH buffer medias (1.2, 4.5, 6.8 and 7.8) were both buffer and pH-dependent and behave differently against morphology. The IDR did not change in both pH = 1.2 and 4.5 medias, even if, morphology structures has changed. While, habits and the pore sizes and their number and agglomeration, impact strongly the IDR in the pH 6.8 medias. It showed also that the IDR was significantly impacted by PSD only in the pH 7.8 media as the samples with higher d 90 , have slower IDR compared to a d 90 less than 50 µm.",

    "abstract": "Summary Lipophilicity indices for vitamins A and E, and for some precursors of vitamin A, have been determined for the first time by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) on C18 and C8 columns. For each column the mobile phases were methanol-water mixtures with methanol in volume proportions from 86 to 90% (υ/υ) in 1% steps. The regression correlation coefficients obtained for both stationary phases were excellent (usually >0.999). To compare the experimental lipophilicity estimated for the compounds by use of log k′w, S, ϕ0, the means of k′ and log k′, and the scores of k′ and log k′ corresponding to the first principal component, and log P values calculated by use of different computer software a correlation matrix was constructed. Better correlations were obtained in both cases between the mean of k′ and the mean of log k′, and scores corresponding to the first principal component obtained by applying principal-components analysis to the matrix of retention factors and computed log P values. The best correlations were found between the mean of k′ and scores corresponding to the first principal component determined on C8 and most of the computed log P values.",

The drug was subjected to acid (0.1 m HCl), neutral, and alkaline (0.1 m NaOH) hydrolytic conditions at 80°C, and to oxidative decomposition at room temperature. Photolysis was carried out by exposing the drug to sunlight (60,000–70,000 lux) for two days. The solid drug was also subjected to 50°C for 60 days in a hot-air oven. Degradation of the drug was found to occur under alkaline, acidic, and neutral hydrolytic conditions. Separation of the drug and the degradation products was successfully achieved on a BEH (bridged ethylene hybrid) C18 column with 40:60 aqueous glacial acetic acid (0.2%)-acetonitrile as mobile phase. The flow rate and detection wavelength were 0.1 mL min−1 and 229 nm, respectively. The method was validated and response was found to be linear in the drug concentration range 10–50 μg mL−1. The mean values (±RSD, %) of slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient were 32102 (± 0.0535), 1295 (± 3.02), and 0.9998 (± 0.0493), respectively.

    "abstract": "A new reliable simple solvent extraction method for the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) in canned food was developed employing an aqueous basic extraction solution of 0.25 M K 2 CO 3 /0.10 M NaOH after spiking with BPA-d 16 as internal standard. The BPA was next extracted into diethyl ether after solution acidification to pH = 4 and filtration. Homogenous acetylation at dry basic conditions (acetic anhydride as derivatization agent and solvent with sodium acetate as catalyst) after diethyl ether evaporation was carried out for 30 min at 110 °C. Detection of the acetylated BPA was carried out by gas chromatography–electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (GC–EI/MS) in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode with pulsed split-less mode. The method was applicable in terms of eliminating the use of solvents like acetonitrile for the extraction step, where relatively long evaporation times may have been needed to evaporate acetonitrile. Also, removing lipids and precipitating most of the proteins at acidic conditions (pH = 4) prior to diethyl ether extraction can replace the often used heptane or hexane or solid sorbents. The method was tested linear with limit of linearity (LOL = 750 μg/L) and with coefficient of determination ( R 2= 0.998), repeatable with relative standard deviation (RSDr &lt; 7%) with instrument detection limit (IDL) of 0.01 μg/L and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.034 μg/L. The method detection limit (MDL) ranged from 0.3 μg/kg to 3.2 μg/kg based on 1 g sample (wet weight). Recovery ranged from 85% to 94% with the relative standard deviations of 2%–13%. BPA concentrations in tested canned foods from outlet stores ranged from &lt;MDL to 57.4 ± (2.6) μg/kg which were below the specific limit for BPA migration in food proposed by the European Union (EU) and within the food safety and quality criteria. The extraction and derivatization steps for BPA were unique and have not been reported in literature.",

This method was then applied to UA determination in rat serum of hyperuricemia model. The results from UPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and uric acid kits (phosphor-tungstic acid-based kit and uricase-based kit) were compared. The UPLC results were in very good agreement with HPLC. The developed method could be employed as a useful tool for the determination of UA in biofluids.",

Then, the volatile organic compounds corresponding to the selected characteristic peaks were identified via library searching, and the height values of those peaks were arranged for further chemometric pretreatment. Principal component analysis was employed to reveal significant differences and potential patterns between samples. Finally, quadratic discriminant analysis was applied to develop a classification model and achieved a correct classified rate of 95.35% for the prediction set.

This analysis could be accomplished within 12.5 min with an Alltima Phenyl Column by isocratic elution using a mixture of KH2PO4 (20 mM)-acetonitrile (96:4, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow-rate of 0.6 mL min−1 and a wavelength of 210 nm. This method was successfully applied to quantify ephedra alkaloids in both Ma-xing-gan-shi decoction and Ephedra decoction. The concentration of total ephedra alkaloids (4.62 mg mL−1) in Ma-xing-gan-shi decoction was much lower than that (7.10 mg mL−1) in Ephedra decoction. Furthermore, the concentration of NME, NMP, E, PE, and ME was significantly lower in Ma-xing-gan-shi decoction than that in Ephedra decoction, respectively. The method was easily acceptable and would be popular with most analytical laboratories.",

The optimal experiment parameters obtained were 65-μm PDMS/DVB SPME fiber, a microwave power of 400 W, and an irradiation time of 3 min. MD-SPME was compared with headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and conventional hydrodistillation (HD) for the extraction of essential oil compounds in N. crispa. A comparative qualitative and quantitative study on the composition of the oils was carried out. For this, 26 compounds, constituting 98.2% of the oil, were identified in the essential oil by MD-SPME, and 23 compounds, representing 91.3% of the oil, were characterized in the SPME and HD methods; 25 compounds, constituting 94.6% of the oil, were separated and identified. The main compounds identified by all methods were 1,8-cineol, β-bourbonene, α-terpineol, and β-pinene. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values of less than 8% show that the MD-SPME method has good repeatability. It has been shown that the extraction of essential oils from N. crispa with MD-SPME was better in terms of energy saving, extraction time, plant material, oxygenated fractions, and product quality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The major processes for introducing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in food are smoking and grilling of different products. But in addition, PAHs can permeate in the food chain due to their high lipophilicity and ability to be accumulated in specific tissue, through contaminated animal feed. Further, when some parts of these animals are marketed as food, the accumulated PAHs can go to the human organism. Some of them are classified as highly toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic for animal and human organisms so they are under consideration of International and European legislation. This work reports development and validation of simple and fast GC/MS method for 16 PAHs determination. Comparison of two methods for sample preparation in pork meat matrix standard extraction/saponification procedure and modified QuEChERS method is also done. In addition, this paper report the calibration step of instrument and a recovery study for 16 PAHs in model pork meat, using modified QuEChERS procedure for sample pretreatment. The calibration step with accessible and suitable for use in real laboratory conditions internal standard (chrysene D 12 ) is done in the range 10–100 ppb using toluene as solvent. The obtained results show very good linearity (R 2 = 0.99 to 1.00). For the recovery study six model samples were spiked with 16 PAHs and they all are subjected to QuEChERS procedure. The recovery is calculated and the obtained data (71–120%) is in a good correlation with requirements of international legislation. Finally, LOD values for all 16 investigated compounds of modified GC/MS method and for the instrument were determined.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ganoderma lucidum (GL), also known as Reishi or Lingzhi, is a medicinal mushroom widely used in traditional and folk medicines. The extracts made from the fruiting body and spore of naturally grown GL are the most frequently used in commercial products. More than 400 compounds have been identified in GL with the triterpenoids considered to be the major active components. Large variations in the chemical components were reported in previous studies and there is no comprehensive study of the content of multiple major triterpenoids in the GL product. In addition, there is no report in the comparison of chemical profiles in different parts of GL (i.e., fruiting body and spore). Determining the chemical composition and comparing the differences between fruiting body and spore are essential for the identity, efficacy and safety of various GL products. In this study, 13 compounds (ganoderenic Acid C, ganoderic Acid C2, ganoderic Acid G, ganoderic Acid B, ganoderenic Acid B, ganoderic Acid A, ganoderic Acid H, ganoderenic Acid D, ganoderic Acid D, ganoderic Acid F, ganoderic Acid DM, ganoderol A, and ergosterol) were selected as the chemical markers. The purpose of this study is to develop an HPLC-DAD fingerprint method for quantification of these active components in GL (spore and fruiting body) and test the feasibility of using the HPLC-DAD fingerprint for quality control or identity determination of GL products. The results showed that this method could determine the levels of the major components accurately and precisely. Among the 13 components, 11 ganoderma acids were identified to be proper chemical markers for quality control of GL products, while ganoderal A was in a very low amount and ergosterol was not a specific marker in GL. The extracts of fruiting body contained more chemical compounds than those of spore, indicating that these 11 compounds could be a better chemical marker for the fruiting body than the spore. The HPLC chemical fingerprint analysis showed higher variability in the quality of GL harvest in different years, while lesser variation in batches harvested in the same year. In conclusion, an HPLC assay detecting 11 major active components and a fingerprinting method was successfully established and validated to be feasible for quality control of most commercial GL products.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to the relative independence from the operational parameters, the linear retention indices (LRIs) are useful tool in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) qualitative analysis. The aim of the current study was to develop a multiple linear regression (MLR) model for the prediction of LRIs as a function of selected molecular descriptors. Liquid injection GC-MS was used for the analysis of Essential oils (Rose, Lavender and Peppermint) separating the ingredients by a semi-standard non-polar stationary phase. As a result, a sum of 103 compounds were identified and their experimental LRIs were derived relying on reference measurements of a standard mixture of n-alkanes (from C8 to C20). As a next step, a set of molecular descriptors was generated for the distinguished chemical structures. Further, a stepwise MLR was applied for the selection of the significant descriptors (variables) which can be used to predict the LRIs. From an exploit set of over 2000 molecular descriptors, it was found that only 16 can be regarded as significant and independent variables. At this point split validation was applied: the identified compounds were randomly divided into training (85%) and validation (15%) sets. The training set (87 compounds) was used to derive two MLR models by applying i) the ‘enter’ algorithm ( R 2 = 0.9960, RMSЕ = 17) and ii) the ‘stepwise’ one ( R 2 = 0.9958, RMSЕ = 17). The predictive power was assessed by the validation set (16 compounds) as follows i) q 2 F1 = 0.9896, RMSE = 25 and ii) q 2 F1 = 0.9886, RMSE = 26, respectively. The adequateness of both regression approaches was further evaluated. Newly developed headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) procedures in combination with GC-MS were used for an alternative analysis of the studied Essential oils. Twelve additional compounds, not previously detected by the liquid sample introduction mode of analysis, were identified for which the values of the significant descriptors were within the working range of the developed MLRs. For the last compounds, the LRIs were calculated and the experimental data was used as an external set for assessment of the regression models. The predictive power for both regression approaches was assessed as follows: Enter RMSE = 41, q 2 F2 = 0.9503 and Stepwise RMSE = 40, q 2 F2 = 0.9521.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A simple, fast and selective analytical method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of allantoin and D-panthenol in cosmetic products containing Aloe vera extracts. The proposed method depends on reversed-phase liquid chromatography with isocratic flow profile of the mobile phase composed of acetonitrile–10 mM phosphoric acid (pH 2.5) (85:15, v/v), with a C18 column at 30 °C. The analytes were detected with UV–vis. detector at 210 nm. The injection volume was 20 μL. The linearity ranges were found to be 0.2–20 and 0.1–10 μg mL −1 for allantoin and D-panthenol, respectively. LOD values were found to be 0.07 μg mL −1 and 0.03 μg mL −1 , LOQ values were found to be 0.2 and 0.1 μg mL −1 for allantoin and D-panthenol, respectively. No interference was observed from concomitants. The developed method was applied to the analysis of 10 different type cosmetic products. It is foreseen that the method will be able to be used in order to carry out routine analysis, quality control and standardization in cosmetic products containing allantoin and D-panthenol.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial sweeteners are low-calorie substances used as food additives with aim to impart a sweet taste to beverages without adding significant calories. Due to the regulatory compliance regarding the type and the amount of artificial sweetener, and due to the large consumption of beverages and the effects of artificial sweeteners on human health, their identification and quantification is of a great importance. In this research simultaneous determination of acesulfame K (ACE-K), sodium saccharin (Na-SAC) and aspartame (ASP) as the most commonly used sweeteners in beverages was performed with a reversed – phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP – HPLC) with diode array detection (DAD). The best separation of the analytes was achieved on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (3.0 × 50 mm, 2.7 µm) column and isocratic elution with a mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and diluted phosphoric acid (pH = 3.8) with 7/93 volume ratio ( V/V ), and flow rate of 1 mL min −1 . The chromatographic process was followed at 195, 220 and 230 nm, under constant column temperature (25 °C). Under these chromatographic conditions, the total time of analysis was less than 5 min. The developed method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). The LOD under established chromatographic conditions was 0.03, 0.07 and 0.17 mg L −1 for Na-SAC, ACE-K and ASP, respectively. The amount of artificial sweeteners in analyzed samples ranged from 30.32 to 148.37 mg L −1 for ACE-K, from 16.10 to 93.05 for Na-SAC, and from 6.06 to 512.72 for ASP. The validated method was successfully applied for determination of analytes in different commercially available beverages.",

Multi-response optimization of sensitivity, speed, repeatability of peak height and migration time, and their relative standard deviation (RSD; n = 5), was performed. Electrophoretic factors assumed to be independently affecting the analysis were optimized by use of factorial design and response-surface methods. Other factors were optimized by the univariant method. The optimum conditions were: running buffer 100 mM phosphate, pH 6, injection time 8 s, column temperature 25°C, separating potential 25 kV, column length 31.2 cm, and detection at 222 nm. The method was validated in the presence of the excipients identified by the manufacturer of the tablets (Levitra). Good analytical data were obtained, including linear range 0.5–75 µg mL −1 , recovery 98.8%, repeatability (as RSD) 1.3% (seven consequent injections on the same day), intermediate precision (as RSD) 3.4% (five injections over a week), and limits of detection and quantification 0.042 and 0.140 µg mL −1 , respectively. Selectivity was assessed in relation to the other, structurally related, drug commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction (sildenafil); sufficient separation was achieved.",

In this study we have demonstrated, for the first time, the spontaneous oscillatory in-vitro transenantiomerization of S-(+)-flurbiprofen (an important non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID) and R-(−)-flurbiprofen, as monitored by polarimetry. It is also noteworthy that – as far as we are aware – this is the first report of separation of the enantiomers of flurbiprofen by TLC. This separation was achieved by two-dimensional development using a simple chromatographic system comprising a commercial silica gel layer impregnated with L-arginine as stationary phase and ethanol containing a few drops of glacial acetic acid as mobile phase. Unfortunately, this chromatographic system resulted in catalysis of structural conversion of the optically pure flurbiprofen enantiomer, either S-(+), or R-(−), to the scalemic or racemic mixture of the two antimers. This is an interesting contribution to general knowledge about the reactivity of this particular profen, although the spontaneous and rapid conversion observed prevents use of this TLC system for identification and quantification of individual flurbiprofen enantiomers.",

Next, standard solutions of BPA and extracts of powdered milk were derivatized with two different reagents – N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS), and bromoacetonitrile (BAN). Compounds were separated on a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. fused-silica capillary column coated with a 0.25 µm film of 5% diphenyl 95% dimethylpolysiloxane. LOD of BPA and the derivatization products were calculated from the signal-to-noise ratio. Detection limits for BPA were very dependent on the derivatization agent used – 57 ppb for BSTFA + 1% TMCS and 367 ppb for BAN. The procedure was used to confirm the presence of BPA in extracts of powdered milk. Identification of BPA was based on comparison of retention times and peak-intensity ratios of selected ions from mass spectra of BPA derivatization products obtained by GC–MS of standard solutions and milk extracts.",

Plasma samples were injected directly into the HPLC system after appropriate sample dilution with mobile phase. Separations were performed on a 4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5-μm particle, C18 column, with UV detection at 238 nm. The mobile phase was 0.5% (w/υ) diisopropyl ether, 1.0% (w/υ) sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), 4.0% (w/v) n-butanol, and 94.5% (w/w) aqueous 25 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. The method was evaluated according to criteria stated in FDA bioanalytical method validation guidance. The unique approach applied in this paper enables direct analysis of simvastatin and simvastatin acid, so the method can be used to obtain reliable results in a rapid and simple way.",

    "abstract": "Summary Application of chemotaxonomy to the plant kingdom can be regarded as a future challenge to the traditional binomial classification system. Construction of a classification system based on the chemical composition of plants has only recently become possible with the development of sophisticated chromatographic and hyphenated techniques. Successful chemotaxonomy can, however, be achieved only if sufficient experimental evidence is collected confirming the reproducibility of the chemical composition of plant species (irrespective of the specimen, its growing season, location of the collection site, etc.). The objective of this study was to compare, by use of gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) the efficiency of isolation of volatile compounds from five different Salvia L. (sage) species (S. lavandulifolia, S. staminea, S. hians, S. triloba, and S. nemorosa) by use of four different techniques [head-space extraction at 70 and 80°C, vapour distillation in a Deryng apparatus, and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE)]. We also compared the composition of the volatile fractions of these species collected during two different seasons (2007 and 2008). It was established that the composition of the volatile fractions is very dependent on the species considered and, in a much less pronounced way, on the growing season. This statement is valid irrespective of the technique used to isolate the volatile compounds from the plant matrix. The seasonal reproducibility of the compounds regarded as chemotaxonomic markers and chemotaxonomic advice compounds (and the repeated absence of such compounds from a species) makes the volatile fraction suitable for chemotaxonomic evaluation of sage. Finally, it was shown that head-space extraction of the volatile fraction at 70°C was the best extraction technique for the purpose of this study.",

The proper denoising of videoscans inside mathematical environments is a critical part of any advanced chemometric processing. The paper reports comparison and optimization of representative videoscan denoising by different techniques. Several kind of filters (averaging, circular, Gaussian, Savitzky-Golay, median, Wiener, FIR) and wavelet shrinkage (twelve mother wavelets from the Daubechies, Symmlet, and Coiflet family, five decomposition levels, and soft/hard thresholding) were optimized against noise autocorrelation or mean-squared error to the reference image. The reference image was obtained by grabbing and averaging 256 CCD frames. The median filter is the winner of the competition; other filters except Gaussian and wavelet shrinkage at high decomposition level are also sufficient and good ways of videoscan denoising. The Gaussian filter and wavelet shrinkage at low decomposition level performed worst and could not be recommended.",

To characterize the degradation products, a method was extended to LC-MS and a mass fragmentation pattern was established using single quadrupole.

An aqueous-organic (acetonitrile) mobile phase with an added chaotropic salt (NaPF6) was used. The system of mobile phases ensured very high selectivity and efficiency at up to N = 6683 ± 963 theoretical plates calculated for isocratic mode. A Hypercosil GOLD column, C18 250 × 4.6 mm, and a Hypercosil GOLD precolumn, 5UM 10 × 4 mm, were employed for detection at four wavelengths, 230 nm being analytical. The regression coefficient (R2) of the calibration was 0.9993 over the range 25–1252 μg mL−1. The recovery rates were 98.36–105.1% with RSD <2.9%. The intra- and inter-day precisions, expressed as RSD, ranged from 1.2% to 2.7%. LOD for HupA was 14 ng mL−1 for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1. The limit of quantification was 140 ng mL−1. The huperzine A (HupA) content of the plant material ranged from 0.65 mg g−1 dry weight (d.w.) to 1.59 mg g−1 d.w. (material from wild plants) and from 0.44 to 1.10 mg g−1 d.w. (material from in vitro cultures). Interestingly, in our study, plants of H. selago derived from wild population had one of the highest HupA concentrations recorded for a club moss (1.59 mg g−1 d.w.). The findings demonstrate that H. selago, found in Europe and North America, is an alternative source of HupA, richer than H. serrata. In order to confirm that HupA was present in the alkaloid extracts, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses of the patterns were performed in the positive ion mode. The fragmentation quasi-molecular ion of the standard HupA (m/z = 243, [M+H]+) and the ion with m/z = 243 found in the samples were identical, confirming the compound as HupA.",

To verify the efficiency of chromatographic run, the system suitability was studied. The theoretical plates (N = 5498.3) and tailing factor (tf = 0.951) were constant during repeated injections. The retention time of doripenem was 7.35 min and the method was validated within the concentration range 5–50 μg mL−1 (r = 0.999). Adequate results were obtained that indicate repeatability (RSD % = 1.03–1.37), inter-day precision (RSD % = 0.51) and accuracy. In comparison to spectrophotometric and microbiological methods, statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the obtained results. The proposed method was successfully applied to doripenem quantification, showing it is applicable to determine the antibiotic in the presence of degradation products and also that is a reliable method for routine analysis.",

    "abstract": "A new simple, accurate, selective, precise, economical and stability-indicating high-performance thin layer chromatographic method for the analysis of diosgenin in callus and rhizome of Dioscorea deltoidea was developed and validated. The method was developed on TLC aluminium plates precoated with silica gel 60F254 using solvent system petroleum ether-isopropanol (12:1, v/v), which gives a compact spot of diosgenin (RF value 0.76 ± 0.02). Densitometric analysis of diosgenin was carried out in the absorbance mode at 366 nm after spraying with methanolic sulphuric acid. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r2 = 0.991 and 0.995 for diosgenin with respect to peak height and peak area, respectively, in the concentration range of 100–1000 ng per spot. The limits of detection and quantification for diosgenin were 16.58 and 50.25 ng per spot. The proposed method was applied for determination of diosgenin in rhizome of D. deltoidea (0.047% w/w) as well as in in vitro culture (callus) (0.092% w/w). Statistical analysis proves that the method is repeatable, selective and accurate for the estimation of diosgenin in D. deltoidea. The developed method effectively resolved the diosgenin in D. deltoidea; hence, it can be employed for routine analysis as a stability indicating method.",

One way to circumvent such problem is the development and deployment of rapid, economical and efficient analytical methods. Hence this research aims to develop a High-Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) method for the determination of doxycycline hyclate. A rapid and simple HPTLC method with densitometry detection at 360 nm to determine doxycycline hyclate in capsules and tablet formulations was developed and validated. HPTLC was performed on glass plates coated with C18 reverse phase silica gel 60 F 254 and pretreated with 0.27 M ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (EDTA) solution. The mobile phase was dichloromethane: methanol: acetonitrile: 1% aqueous ammonia in the ratio of 10:22:53:15 (v/v). The linearity range lies between 200 and 1,000 ng/spot with correlation coefficient of 0.997. The R f value is 0.5 ± 0.02%. Recoveries were in the range of 94.50–100.5%. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation values for doxycycline hyclate were 40 and 160 ng/spot respectively. The developed method was validated as per ICH guidelines. Thus, it was found to be accurate, precise, specific and robust. In forced degradation study, doxycycline hyclate was found to degrade in acidic and alkaline media, and through oxidative stress. The drug was found to be relatively stable to heat and photo degradation. The method was successfully applied for the routine quantitative analysis of dosage forms containing doxycycline hyclate. The developed method offered comparable results (as confirmed by F-test) with that of the HPLC pharmacopoeial (BP) analysis method.",

A fused silica capillary (78.5 cm total length, 70 cm effective length, and 75 μm id) was used in separation using a 40 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5 as a running background electrolyte (BGE) under a positive potential of 30 KV, at a stable temperature of 25 °C for capillary during separation.

Consumers may unknowingly take products laced with varying quantities of approved prescription drug ingredients, controlled substances, and untested and unstudied pharmaceutically active ingredients. Hidden ingredients are increasingly becoming a problem in products promoted for sexual enhancement, weight loss, or bodybuilding. The tests have revealed the presence of some undesired substances like sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and their analogues in tainted sexual enhancement products. The content of these substances is usually around the daily curative dose. A simple high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for simultaneously determination of sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, dapoxetine, yohimbine, and sibutramine was developed and validated.

    "abstract": "Abstract The quality of pesticide formulations has an impact on the crop safety, environment and human health. Therefore, the development of new analytical methods for the determination of active substances in pesticide formulations in order to control their quality, as well as, their residues in food samples in order to ensure food safety, is always welcome. A new, simple, precise and accurate normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) method for determination of an active ingredient malathion in the commercial emulsifiable concentrate pesticide product has been developed and validated. The analysis was carried out on a LiChrosorb CN (250 x 4 mm, 5 μm) analytical column using isocratic elution with mobile phase consisted of n -hexane and dichloromethane (80/20, v/v ), flow rate of 1 mL/min, constant column temperature at 25 °C and ultraviolet diode-array detection at 220 nm. The obtained values for multiple correlation coefficients ( R 2 ≥ 0.9990), relative standard deviation of retention times, peak areas and heights (RSD ≤ 1.14%), recoveries ranged from 98.97 to 101.62%, revealed that the developed method has a satisfactory linearity, precision and accuracy. Also, the developed method was successfully applied for determination of malathion residues in apple juice samples, after preliminary sample preparation using solid-phase extraction. Specificity, selectivity, linearity, matrix effect, precision and accuracy were tested in order to validation of this method. The obtained results were in acceptable ranges and indicated that the developed method is suitable for routine determination of malathion in the pesticide formulation, as well as for determination of malathion residues in apple juice samples. The run time of HPLC analysis was about 6 min.",

The using of toxic organic solvents for the analysis of drugs is critical. In the current work, several simple and less costly approaches such as micellar and/or cyclodextrin liquid chromatography were discussed. A new eco-friendly and simple chromatographic analysis of the ternary mixture of amiloride hydrochloride (AM), atenolol (AT), and hydrochlorothiazide (HZ) in urine by hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) bonded stationary phase was investigated. The experimental conditions were optimized and validated based on International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q2R1 guidelines to detect analytes by isocratic mobile phase of phosphate buffer (5.0 mmol L−1, pH 7.0) in the presence of 0.5 mL min−1 flow rate, 25.0 °C, and 280 nm. Linearity, accuracy, and precision were found to be acceptable over the concentration range of 0.05–20.0 μg mL−1 for AM, 0.05–50.0 μg mL−1 for AT and 0.05–50.0 μg mL−1 for HZ. The proposed method was precise, selective, and sensitive enough for the routine analysis of ternary mixture at therapeutic urine levels. The inclusion complexation and the appendant hydroxyl groups of HP-β-CD were considered the main reasons for assisting in adequate separation of the drugs. On the other hand, the presence of kosmotropic phosphate ions could solubilize the protein and could strengthen the selective inclusion of drugs inside HP-β-CD cavity. Urinary excretion studies showed that the detection of drugs is possible up to 24 h after their ingestion.",

The acceptable performance parameters combined with the properties of easy and quick handling and cost-effectiveness have made mini-Luke modified extraction method as the most favorable in the pesticide residues analysis from grapes and tomatoes by GC—TOF-MS. The efficiency of the chosen extraction method was also verified for lettuce; for this matrix, a cleanup step with graphitized black carbon (GBC) was added. Analysis of extracts was carried out by GC—TOF-MS within 29.2 min run time. The GC method was validated for grapes and tomatoes in terms of linearity, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). Good linearity with correlation coefficients (r2) higher than 0.98 was obtained. For most analytes from both matrices, recoveries were in the range of 71–120% and LOQ values in the range of 0.01–0.05 mg kg−1. The GC—TOF-MS and modified mini-Luke extraction methods were successfully tested on real vegetable and fruit samples belonging to the same commodities group as those from validated methods according to European Guide DG SANCO 12571/2013 (tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, potatoes, carrots, eggplants, onion, lettuce and grapes) and in proficiency EU tests.",

This method is used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of evaluated corticosteroids. Mometasone furoate, hydrocortisone acetate, fluocinonide, fluocinolone acetonide, betamethasone, betamethasone dipropionate and triamcinolone acetonide were evaluated. Separation was performed on Inertsil® ODS-3V 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm chromatographic column.

Selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision and limit of quantification (LOQ) were evaluated. Method is selective because ambiphilic cream base peaks and corticosteroids peaks were not overlapping. Linearity was confirmed since correlation coefficient was 1 for all compounds. Accuracy and precision were evaluated for hydrocortisone acetate and betamethasone dipropionate. Determined Recovery values were in range of 70–130%. Both RSD values (21.46% and 9.59%) were lower than 30%. Method is highly sensitive since LOQ concentrations were in ng mL −1 range.

    "abstract": "Abstract Pregabalin is a gabapentinoid approved for the treatment of general anxiety disorder, neuropathic pain and as adjunctive therapy for focal seizures in patients with epilepsy. In addition, there are a number of conditions for which pregabalin is prescribed off-label. Along with the widespread use there are a significant number of reports describing the misuse of pregabalin over the last decade. Over time, it became clear that pregabalin should become part of routine testing in toxicology laboratories. The aim of this paper was to present validation of a LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of pregabalin in plasma of acutely poisoned patients. Simple sample preparation step and rapid chromatographic separation shortened the overall analysis time, which was the goal of method development. The presence of pregabalin was confirmed with three ion transitions, ensuring high selectivity of the validated method. The statistical data obtained showed good precision and accuracy over a wide concentration range. No endogenous or other interference was detected, and there was no matrix effect influence with this method. The LC-MS/MS method was applied to quantify pregabalin in plasma samples of patients admitted to the emergency department due to a possible acute pregabalin overdose. Different concentrations were found, and we report, to the best of our knowledge, the highest plasma concentration of pregabalin in the plasma of a patient with acute poisoning. In conclusion, we developed a fast and simple LC-MS/MS method for reliable determination of pregabalin and demonstrated the developed method was suitable for routine use in clinical toxicology setting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Residues of the fungicides difenoconazole, propiconazole, cyflufenamid, and mandipropamid were determined in tomato fruit using acetonitrile for extraction and LC-MS/MS for quantification. Validation criteria include linearity range, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ), accuracy in terms of precision and trueness, and matrix effect were studied. The recovery rates of the method ranged from 91.8 to 106.3%. The precision of the method in terms of repeatability at one day (RSDr) and between three days (RSDR) ranged from 2.8 to 6.4% and from 4.3 to 7.6%, respectively, with good trueness from 92.2 to 96.4%. Matrix effects (suppression effects) ranged from 3.8% to 11.1%. The validated method was used to evaluate the dissipation kinetics of three different premix formulations: 30% EC (15% difenoconazole + 15% propiconazole), 14% DC (12.5% difenoconazole + 1.5% cyflufenamid), and 50% SC (25% difenoconazole + 25% mandipropamid) used on field tomatoes in Egypt. A first-order kinetic equation best describes residue dissipation. The calculated half-lives of difenoconazole, propiconazole, cyflufenamid, and mandipropamid were 2.01–2.27, 1.89, 1.97, and 1.71 days, respectively. The dissipation rate of difenoconazole did not differ significantly in the three premix formulations. Mandipropamid also dissipated faster compared to the other fungicides tested. The chronic dietary risk assessment results showed a minimal risk to adult Egyptian consumers. Waiting periods were advised for the safe consumption of tomatoes treated with the tested premix formulations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mirtazapine is an antidepressant medication used to treat the major depressive disorder in adults. In this study, two different chromatographic methods were developed for the determination of mirtazapine in pharmaceutical products. In the first method, An Extend C 18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) was used and the temperature was kept constant at 25 °C. The mobile phase was determined as 0.1% formic acid solution and acetonitrile (80/20, v/v), and isocratic elution was applied. The flow rate of the mobile phase was determined as 1.0 mL min −1 and the injection volume was 20 µL. Detection was performed at 291 nm. using a UV detector. In the second method, ethanol was used as the organic modifier. The only difference between these methods was the organic modifier. All other conditions of the methods were the same. Both chromatographic methods were validated by ICH guidelines for various parameters such as selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, detection and quantification limit, and robustness. The determination coefficients of chromatographic methods were greater than 0.999 in the concentration range of 5–30 µg mL −1 . of mirtazapine. Later, these chromatographic methods were applied to pharmaceutical formulations. Comparison of the obtained results in terms of means was made using Student's ( t ) test, and comparisons in terms of standard deviations were made using the Fischer (F) test. It was observed that there was no significant difference between these methods. These two methods were then evaluated using the AGREE-Analytical GREEnness metric software. The chromatographic method using ethanol as an organic modifier has been proposed as an excellent eco-friendly and analyst-friendly alternative for the determination of mirtazapine in pharmaceutical formulations.",

Two chromatographic methods are described for evaluation of the quality of Bacopa monnieri extract and its commercial formulations. The first is reversed-phase high-performance thin-layer chromatography (RP-HPTLC), the second is packed column supercritical-fluid chromatography with pho- todiode-array detection (PC-SFC-DAD). SFC conditions were optimized by uniform design. The effect of temperature on the separation of the saponins was studied in detail. The Van't Hoff plots for retention and selectivity were found to be linear. To obtain a better understanding of the different separations, the temperature dependence was studied to determine the thermodynamic data ∆H°, ∆S°, ∆∆H° and ∆∆S°. These data revealed that separation of bacoside A3 was enthalpically favoured in the range of temperatures investigated whereas entropy-controlled separation was observed for bacopaside II. Both methods were validated for precision, robustness, recovery, and limits of detection and quantitation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test were used to correlate results from quantitative deter- mination of the markers by RP-HPTLC and PC-SFC-DAD.",

The compounds were chromatographed on different stationary phases (non-polar and polar-bonded stationary phases — wettable RP18W, silica, and aminopropyl-modified and diol-modified plates) developed with a variety of binary mobile phases (aqueous and non-aqueous). The chemometric techniques principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering were used to evaluate similarities and differences among the chromatographic systems. For selection of the most suitable systems either to perform two-dimensional separation or to enhance overall resolution by merging two stationary phases, indices scoring the separating power of a given system or pair of systems were applied. When separation of all pairs of chromatographic systems was evaluated with the index considered, the theoretical separation achieved in these systems could be visualized as a colour map. This colour map enabled rapid examination of resolution and selection of orthogonal systems enabling acceptable separation of the compounds. On the basis of the colour map it was found that relatively efficient two-dimensional separation of the compounds could be achieved on amino-modified plates developed using 9:1 tetrahydrofuran-water in the first dimension then 9:1, 4:1, 3:1, or 7:3 acetonitrile-water in the second dimension. Theoretically, the best separation could be achieved by combining diol-modified and amino-modified stationary phases and using 3:2 methanol-water and 9:1 acetonitrile-water, respectively, as mobile phases.",

HPLC analysis was performed on a C18 column using a 40:60 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and water as isocratic mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min−1. UV detection was at 227 nm for withaferin-A and 278 nm for 6-gingerol. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, specificity, and sensitivity in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. Validation revealed the method is specific, accurate, precise, reliable and reproducible. Good linear correlation coefficients (r2 > 0.9996) were obtained for calibration plots in the ranges tested. Limits of detection were 0.2 and 0.4 μg and limits of quantification were 0.5 and 1.0 μg for withaferin-A and 6-gingerol, respectively. Intra and inter-day RSD of retention times and peak areas were less than 2.1%. Recovery was between 94.5 and 98.8% for withaferin-A and 94.2 and 102.4% for 6-gingerol. The established HPLC method is appropriate and the two markers are well resolved, enabling efficient quantitative analysis of withaferin-A and 6-gingerol. The method was successfully used for quantitative analysis of these two marker constituents in a marketed polyherbal formulation.",

In this study, a rapid and simplified sample preparation method based on SPE was studied by eliminating some steps, such as conditioning and washing, for extraction of diosmin, eriocitrin, narirutin, naringin, and hesperidin in orange, tangerine, and lime juice samples. The separation of these flavonoids was achieved by using a C8 column with a mobile phase comprised of water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (78:21:1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.85 mL min−1 and UV detection at 280 nm. To examine the applicability of this method, effective parameters such as type of adsorbent, type and volume of elution solvent, ionic strength, and pH of the sample were studied and applied to the comparison between the conventional SPE and the simplified method. The best recoveries were obtained, using the proposed method, with a small volume of citrus fruit juice (0.5 mL), silica gel (0.5 g) as adsorbent, and 3 mL of methanol as elution solvent.

Optimum extraction of VACs was achieved when extractions were performed at 100°C with 0.5 g of sample in 3 mL of water for 60 min. Maximum recovery of VACs was achieved using hexane (2 mL) as extraction solvent. Six major VACs extracted from citronella grass were identified as citronellal, citronellol, neral, geranial, geraniol, and eugenol. Geraniol was the predominant VAC in citronella grass and neral was the major VAC extracted from the lemongrass leaves. Eugenol was not detected in lemongrass leaves extract. The validated method provided good recoveries of VACs ranging from 83.6 to 105.3% with the relative standard deviations of 6.2 to 11.0%. The results presented in this paper show that the amount of essential oils extracted from the fresh citronella grass and lemongrass leaves was significantly higher as compared to those extracted from leaves dried at the ambient room temperature for 3 days. Quantities of geraniol, eugenol, and neral extracted from leaves using MHD can be used as marker compounds to differentiate citronella grass from lemongrass leaves extracts. Both storage time and conditions significantly influenced the amount of VACs extracted from citronella incense products.",

This paper reports the development of a facile assay method for norfloxacin (NF) and ciprofloxacin (CF) in their formulations (tablets and eye drops) using SIC. The analytes were rapidly chromatographed on a short C18 monolithic column (4.6 × 50 mm) at a flow rate of 30 μL s−1. An isocratic mode was adopted. The optimum mobile phase composition was 90% water, 10% acetonitrile, and 0.3% triethylamine at pH 3.0. Miniaturized fiber optic spectrometric devices were coupled to the SIC system for UV detection at 280 nm. Sufficient separation with a resolution of 1.6 and numbers of theoretical plates of more than 1500 was achieved. Additionally, acceptable peak shapes with peak symmetries of 0.89 and 0.92 for NF and CF, respectively, were obtained. The method was validated and found to be reliable (the recovery was 98.0–100.6%) and precise (the RSDs of intra-/inter-day precision were less than 2.0%). The method is also sensitive. The limits of detection were less than 0.27 μg mL−1.

The extracts were dried under argon, and the residues were redissolved in chloroform before GC-MS analysis. Cholesterol was analyzed in biological materials using the short column temperature program. The simultaneous quantification of cholesterol and its oxides in biological materials was performed using the longer column temperature program. Cholesterol was eluted faster than ChlOs.

Overall maximum content of reserpine (in %) was estimated from the root samples. Roots of field grown plants has recorded high percent of reserpine (0.39%) followed by roots of tissue cultured plantlets (0.35%) and root callus based cell suspension cultures (0.38 %) which was fed with precursor amino acid (100 mg/L of tryptophan). In control type of root callus based cell suspension cultures, reserpine content was quantified as 0.14%; by precursor feeding (100 mg/L of tryptophan) it was enhanced to 0.38%. In conclusion, the reserpine content (0.35 and 0.38%) produced by the roots of tissue cultured plantlets (R 1 ) and 100 mg/L tryptophan fed root callus based cell suspensions was comparable to that of the reserpine content (0.39%) of root parts of field grown plants.

LC method has been performed using reverse phase technique on a C-18 column with a mobile phase consisting of 20 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution and acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) at 25 °C.

In order to obtain the best detection method, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), large volume sample stacking (LVSS), and sweeping-micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (sweeping-MEKC) were used respectively. The limits of detection (LODs) of clonidine and cyproheptadine by LVSS-CZE were 0.028 μg mL −1 and 0.034 μg mL −1 , and those by sweeping-MEKC were 0.023 μg mL −1 and 0.031 μg mL −1 , respectively. Compared with the CZE method, the two online pre-concentration technologies have greatly improved the detection sensitivity and achieved good enrichment results. However, compared with the sweeping-MEKC system, the LVSS system consumed a longer time and was greatly affected by the actual sample matrix. The sweeping-MEKC method was proved to be suitable for real sample analysis. Under the best sweeping-MEKC conditions, clonidine and cyproheptadine could be well separated within 8 min and good linear relationships in the range of 0.1–1.0 μg mL −1 ( r 2 &gt; 0.99) were obtained. This method was successfully applied to the determination of clonidine and cyproheptadine in animal-derived foods with the recoveries of 82.3%–90.1% and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 3.11%. The sweeping-MEKC method is simple to operate and has great potential in the rapid detection of clonidine and cyproheptadine in animal-derived foods.",

The alkaloids detected were corlumidine, protopine, coptisine, tetrahydrojatrorrhizine, palmatine, berberine, sanguinarine, papaverine hydrochloride, tetrahydropalmatine, bicuculline, and corydaline. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a C-18 column with a mobile phase composed of A (0.2% acetic acid solution, adjusted with triethylamine to pH 5.0) and B (acetonitrile), with stepwise gradient elution. Ultraviolet diode-array detection was used; chromatograms were examined at the wavelength of 280 nm. The regression equations showed a good linear relationship between the peak area of each marker and concentration ( r = 0.9994–0.9999). The recovery values ranged between 93.66% and 100.54%. The method was fully validated with respect to detection and quantification limits, precision, reproducibility, and accuracy. The described high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was successfully used for the differentiation and quantification of the eleven major alkaloids in C. decumbens (Thunb.)

    "abstract": "Selection of adsorbent for the development of purification process for biomolecules is crucial due to the requirement of large number of binding sites and adsorption area. Considering this, porous structure with high charge density is selected as an adsorbent for macromolecule purification. Such selection may provide high static binding capacity but causes loss of separation performance due to improper porosity of adsorbent in comparison to solute sizes involved. To address this problem for the screening of adsorbent, this work reports adsorbent selection procedure on the basis of adsorbent pore diameter ( d p ), solute hydrodynamic dimensions (RH), and flow velocity in support of binding capacity. Towards that end, this study evaluated the pore accessibility performance of varying characteristics adsorbents using tracers like acetone, lysozyme, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by designing nonbinding conditions. All screened adsorbents showed certain loss of total surface area depending on the solute dimensions and pore size. Sepharose type adsorbents showed accessible area loss up to 25% for lysozyme and 50% for BSA. Sepabeads type showed 30% loss, while macroporous UNO type showed only 7% loss of surface area for lysozyme. The study correlates accessibility with size ratio β ( d p /RH). The value of β &gt; 38 is found to be required for the accessibility of total pore area and optimum separation performance of ion exchangers investigated. Accessibility and β provide useful information for the selection of suitable adsorbent for the purification of macromolecules.",

The presence of additives in the polymer matrix enables the modification or improvement of the properties and performance of the polymer, but these additives are potential risk for human health. In this context, an efficient analytical method for the quantitative determination of three antioxidants (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT), dibutylhydroxyphenylpropionic acid stearyl ester (Irganox 1076), and tns-(2.4-di-tert-butyl)-phosphite (Irgafos 168)) and five ultraviolet stabilizers (2-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methylphenyl) (UV-P), (2′-hydroxy-3′-tert-5′-methylphenyl)-5-chloroben zotriazole (UV-326), 2-(2′-hydroxy-3′,5′-di-tert-butylphenyl)-5-chlorobenzotriazole (UV-327), 2-(2 H -benzotriazol- 2-yl)-4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol(UV-329), and 2-hydroxy-4(octyloxy) benzophenone (UV-531)) in polypropylene food packaging and food simulants by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been developed. Parameters affecting the efficiency in the process such as extraction and chromatographic condition were studied in order to determine operating conditions. The analytical method showed good linearity, presenting correlation coefficients ( R ≥ 0.9977) for all additives. The limits of detection and quantification were between 0.03 and 0.30 μg mL −1 and between 0.10 and 1.00 μg mL −1 for eight analytes, respectively. Average spiked recoveries in blank polypropylene packaging and food simulants were in the range of 80.4–99.5% and 75.2–106.7%, with relative standard deviations in the range of 0.9–9.1% and 0.2–9.8%. Dissolving the polypropylene food packaging with toluene and precipitating by methanol was demonstrated more effective than ultrasonic extract with acetonitrile or dichloromethane for extracting the additives.

Chromatographic separation was accomplished by a mobile phase containing 15 mM monopotassium phosphate solution of pH 3.3 and methanol (75:25, v/v) in an isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1.4 mL min −1 at 30 °C. The separation was evaluated on a column with a new polar-endcapped C 18 stationary phase Arion® Polar C18 or well-known phase Luna® Omega Polar C18. Excellent linearity ( R 2 0.9998) was shown over range 10–300 mg L −1 with mean percentage recovery 90%. Peak shapes were symmetrical in both columns, Arion® Polar C18 and Luna® Omega Polar C18, with asymmetry factor of 1.0 and 1.4, tailing factor of 1.0 and 1.2, and retention factor of 4.6 and 5.6, respectively. The Arion® Polar C18 was almost 1.4-fold more effective than Luna® Omega Polar C18 phase. The LOQ for ampicillin was achieved 10 mg L −1 for Luna® Omega Polar C18 and 5 mg L −1 for Arion® Polar C18 using 20 µL of a solution containing 0.24 mg mL −1 of cephalexin as an internal standard. A number of articles dealing with the determination of ampicillin is limited, therefore, this study showed the HPLC method suitable for the determination of AMP in human blood plasma from patient who underwent elective cardiac surgical revascularization. In addition, the determination of AMP was also performed for the first time using an Arion® Polar C18 column, which effectively separated AMP from other compounds present in human blood plasma. This new polar-endcapped phase can help in separation of polar antibiotics or other polar compounds, which are unsuccessfully separated on conventional C 18 column, and thus can help during method development.",

A simple, isocratic HPLC method for separation, identification and determination of gentamicin and parabens (methylparaben and propylparaben) was developed and validated. To our knowledge there is no report about simultaneous determination of those three analytes in pharmaceutical products. The optimum chromatographic conditions were achieved on CN column with a mobile phase consisting of 0.15% triethylamine in 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 aqueous solution (final pH 3.0 adjusted with H 3 PO 4 ) and methanol in the ratio 70:30 (v/v), providing selective quantification of analytes within 5 min. The method was successfully validated according to ICH guidelines acceptance criteria in terms of selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness. The linearity of the method was proved in defined concentrations ranges for gentamicin (0.32–1.04 mg mL −1 ), methylparaben (0.0072–0.0234 mg mL −1 ) and propylparaben (0.0008–0.0026 mg mL −1 ). Relative standard deviations calculated for all analytes in precision testing were &lt;2% (analysis repeatability) and &lt;3% (intermediate precision). Recovery values were between 98.87% and 101.67%. Chromatographic parameters are not significantly influenced by small variations of column temperature, pH and molarity of KH 2 PO 4 . Finally, the method was successfully applied for quantitative determination of gentamicin and parabens in commercially available solution for injection. Proposed HPLC method is found to be promising in terms of simplicity, analysis times and non-use of derivatization and ion-pair agents.",

For efficient preprocessing and comparison of these fingerprints, chemometric methods were used. The main emphasis was on preprocessing of herbal fingerprints and selecting a suitable preprocessing strategy for exploring differences among them. After successful preprocessing of the fingerprints, principal component analysis was used to reveal chemical differences among the samples. An outcome of the comparative analysis was to pinpoint specific regions of the fingerprints indicative of differences among the samples. In fingerprints of the volatile fraction from the sage (Salvia L.) species, obtained from head-space gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, important regions were identified and associated with the presence of camphene, limonene, and eucalyptol in these samples.",

    "abstract": "Enantiomer separations have been one of the most important and, simultaneously, one of the most difficult to accomplish analytical (and technological) tasks, present at the top of separation scientists' agenda since the early sixties of the last century. Awareness of their importance has been awakened by an infamous case of the racemic drug thalidomide, a widely advertised sedative drug which had unexpected teratogenic activity in pregnant women that resulted in thousands of 'flipper babies' born in the late fifties and the early sixties in many countries around the world. Since that time, separation scientists have developed numerous methods for enantiomer separation, basically by use of gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). In this respect, planar chromatography has remained to a large extent an undervalued enantiomer separation technique, despite separation performance sufficient to separate a pair of enantiomers. The large number of GC, HPLC, and CE enantiomer separation strategies and methods developed are evidence that — once confronted with this particular and no doubt very important challenge — instrumental chromatographic techniques have lost if not face, then, to a large extent, their reputation as robust, universal, and efficient separation tools. In these circumstances, planar chromatography on silica gel seems a very promising and tempting alternative, basically because of the advantageous properties of microcrystalline silica gel and the 2D effective diffusion available only in planar chromatographic mode. Enhancement of the enantiomer separating power of the silica gel by simple mechanical impregnation with a properly chosen chiral selector, and additional coupling of this with efficient instrumental detection (e.g. densitometric, DAD, or mass spectrometric) can yield in a simple, robust, and universal tool for separation of enantiomers comparable with the long-established chromatographic enantiomer-separation techniques. In this mini review, favourable preconditions for silica-gel-based planar chromatographic separation of enantiomers which can elevate planar chromatography to the status of leading tool for separation of enantiomers are discussed. Further improvements which can enhance the enantiomer separation performance of chiral planar chromatography are also indicated.",

Earlier, we succeeded in demonstrating that amino acids and hydroxy acids can undergo spontaneous peptidization and spontaneous esterification (both regarded as condensation), respectively, when dissolved in 70% aqueous ethanol. In this study we provide experimental proof from thin-layer chromatography and 13C NMR spectroscopy of spontaneous condensation of profens, with ketoprofen as an example. It can be expected that other profen drugs undergo an analogous condensation. In the future, an analogy between the ability of amino acids, hydroxy acids, and profens to undergo spontaneous peptidization or condensation (as reported in our papers), and the ability of selected organosilanols to undergo the spontaneous oscillatory condensation (as reported elsewhere), might prove essential for better understanding of detailed mechanism of the spontaneous oscillatory in-vitro chiral conversion of the selected low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids.",

Response surface methodology (RSM)-optimized infrared-assisted extraction (IRAE) was developed and combined with HPLC for simultaneous determination of tryptanthrin, indigo, and indirubin from R. Isatidis. IRAE were investigated through extraction yields of the three components and optimized by RSM. The optimum conditions were as follows: infrared power of 129 W, solid/liquid ratio of 1:40 g/mL, and irradiation time of 22.5 min. IRAE conditions obtained by RSM were not only accurate, but also had practical value reflecting the expected optimization. Subsequently, this novel IRAE method was evaluated by extraction yield of the components of R. Isatidis samples from different regions. Compared with common extraction methods including maceration extraction (ME), reflux extraction (RE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), IRAE showed higher yield with advantages of no limitation of solvent selection, low cost, convenience under optimum extraction conditions. These results suggested the potential of RSM-optimized IRAE for extraction and analysis of the water-/fat-soluble compositions of Chinese herbal medicine. A simple chromatographic separation for simultaneous determination of tryptanthrin, indigo, and indirubin from Chinese herbal medicine R. Isatidis was performed on a C18 column (Diamonsil 150 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm) with a mobile phase isocratic consisting of methanol and water at a flow-rate of 0.8 mL min−1.

These include N-acetyltyrosine (NAT) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). This leads to a need to develop new analytical methods for rapid and easy determination of these substances in the presence of common AAs. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is one of the techniques that have been successfully applied to the assay of multi-component samples containing AAs and their derivatives. This paper discusses a new CE method for the simultaneous determination of two acetylated AAs in solutions for parenteral nutrition. A background electrolyte (BGE) was developed based on borate buffer with alkaline pH. The method is selective and enables the separation and assay of analytes without special sample pretreatment. Validation parameters confirmed sufficient precision and accuracy of the method. Its applicability was verified by testing several medicinal products from various manufacturers. Moreover, the flexibility of the method was checked using two brands of CE equipment. Appropriate adjustment of instrumental parameters turned out to be essential for method transferability. The method could be used in routine testing of parenteral nutrition medicinal products containing AAs.",

The highest extraction efficiency was obtained for the SPME method, with the highest number of identified components and best precision. As a consequence, the SPME method was used for the comparison of the volatile components of seeds, leaves, and pedicles of K. odoratissima collected from three different regions. One of the major components of the plant was butyl phthalide. The levels of this compound in the extractions from leaves, pedicles, and seeds were 34.1, 23.8, and 12.9%, respectively.

The molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of the MD probe was 30 kDa. The perfusion rate was 1 μL/min, and the perfusion liquid was Millipore-Q water. HPLC was performed using an Inertsil ODS-SP column. The mobile phase comprised 60:40 (v/v) methanol and water containing 0.2% phosphoric acid. The elution rate was 0.6 mL/min rate at 30°C. The average recoveries of the four kinds of hormones ranged from 93% to 109%, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.998. The determinations of endogenous hormones in plants as real time, living, and online were realized by MD-HPLC. The cells and macromolecules were excluded by the MD probe so centrifugation or protein precipitation was not required prior to analysis. MD-HPLC is a highly sensitive and selective method for the simultaneous profiling and quantification of a wide variety of plant hormone groups. This method is convenient for studying the mechanism of plant hormones.",

    "abstract": "The use of polyphenols in food fortification is a common custom generally carried out to increase its nutritional value. In this paper, ground chili pepper was proposed as a potential functional coffee additive. Various phenolic compounds present in this spice were analyzed by a new, sensitive, and selective ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS). Separation was done on a column filled with a modified silica gel RP-18, in gradient solvent systems A (1% H 3 PO 4 in water) and B (40% CH 3 CN in solution A). The capsaicin was found as the main phenolic compound of ground chilli pepper, which concentration was 295.95 mg g −1 . It was demonstrated that quercetin is present in this spice also in different forms: not only as dihydrocapsaicin but also as quercetin-3- O -deoxyhexoside-glucuronide and quercetin-3- O -deoxyhexoside, whereas luteolin in the form of three compounds: luteolin-7- O -dihexoside, luteolin-6- C -hexoside-8- C -pentoside, and luteolin-7- O -malonyl-dihexosyl-pentoside. We have also identified apigenin-6- C -hexoside-8- C -pentoside. Furthermore, this paper, for the first time, evaluates the potential bioaccessibility of and interactions between compounds with multidirectional antioxidant properties from coffee and ground chili pepper. All samples, coffee, chili, and a mixture of the two showed ability to scavenge free radicals and chelate iron ions and were characterized by reducing power. The level of these activities changed after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. In the mixtures of water extracts, phytochemicals acted synergistically in the case of five from six tested methods. Interestingly, after digestion, in vitro chili extract lost ability to scavenge O 2 − radicals; that is why it was impossible to determine the interactions between coffee and chili in this case. Moreover, an antagonism in the action was observed for those cases, where, in water extracts, we have identified synergistic interaction.",

    "abstract": "The off-line two-dimensional supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)–ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) was selected to separate the triterpene saponins from Panax notoginseng . The separation by SFC was performed on an Atlantis® HILIC silica column. Methanol was selected as a modifier, and the most time-saving gradient was developed. The decrease of the column temperature and the increase of the back pressure could shorten the retention time but had no effect on the separation selectivity. Then, the back pressure, column temperature, and flow rate were set as 131 bar, 45 °C, and 4.0 mL min −1 , respectively. The retention behavior of the saponins from P. notoginseng was different between SFC and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), which facilitated to construct an off-line SFC/RPLC–mass spectrometry (MS) system. In first dimension, a total of eight fractions were collected under SFC and further analyzed by RPLC–MS in second dimension. The result indicated that the retention behavior of triterpene saponins was mainly controlled by the hydrogen bonding interactions which were affected by the number and types of sugars, as well as the aglycone in the structure of triterpene saponins. Thus, the presence of “clustering effect” under SFC was observed, namely, one SFC peak always contained several saponins with same number of sugars and similar structure of aglycone. The clustering effect of triterpene saponins promised SFC to be used as first dimension to complete the preliminary crude separation in the two-dimensional liquid chromatography.",

The separation was achieved at a voltage of 25 kV and a temperature of 21 °C using paracetamol as an internal standard.

The limits of detection for FTC and TDF were 1.25 and 1.00 μg/mL, respectively. The average percentage recoveries of FTC and TDF from their tablet formulations were 99.66 ± 0.73 and 99.48 ± 0.33, respectively. The two drugs were subjected to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions, and then the stressed samples were analyzed by the proposed method.

A validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method for the determination of PHL in rat biological matrices was developed and applied to investigate and compare the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and excretion of PHL and TAPHL in rats following a single oral administration. The method was validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, range, selectivity, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), recovery, and matrix effect. All validation parameters met the acceptance criteria according to regulatory guidelines. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters of t max , C max , AUC (0 − t ) , CL/F, and t 1/2 were observed after oral administration in rats. The data showed that PHL was absorbed and eliminated rapidly from plasma after oral administration. The pharmacokinetic properties are improved, such as the t max has been prolonged and the area under the curve (AUC) has been enhanced after oral administration of TAPHL to rats. Tissue distribution results indicated that PHL could be rapidly and widely distributed into tissues but could not effectively cross the blood–brain barrier in rats. After oral administration of TAPHL to rats, its tissue distribution to rats was similar as that after oral administration of equimolar PHL. In addition, higher recoveries of PHL following administration of TAPHL indicated that TAPHL might reduce the excretion of PHL from the body by reducing the first pass effect.",

AT showed labile behavior in acidic, basic, neutral, and oxidative stress and led to the formation of two DPs, while OM degraded under acidic, basic, and neutral and resulted in the formation of four DPs. All the stressed samples of AT and OM were resolved on a C-18 column in single run on a gradient liquid chromatographic (LC) mode. A complete mass fragmentation pathway of both the drugs was established with the help of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) studies. The fragmentation was further supported by MS n studies, and for AT, it was carried out up to MS 6 , while for OM, it was up to MS 5 . Then, the stressed samples were analyzed by LC–MS/MS to get the fragmentation patterns of DPs. LC–MS/MS data helped to propose chemical structure of all the DPs. Based on this entire information, degradation pathway of both the drugs was established. The developed method has shown excellent linearity over the range of 10 to 150 μg/mL of OM and AT. The correlation coefficient ( r 2 ) for OM and AT is 0.999 and 0.998, respectively. The main recovery value of OM and AT ranged from 99.97% to 100.54%, while the limit of detection (LOD) for OM and AT was 0.018 and 0.021 μg/mL, and limit of quantitation (LOQ) was found to be 0.051 and 0.063 μg/mL. Finally, the in-silico carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and hepatotoxicity predictions of AT, OM, and all the DPs were performed by using toxicity prediction softwares, viz., TOPKAT, LAZAR, and Discovery Studio ADMET, respectively.",

Samples were extracted using 1% formic acid in ultrapure water and purified via reversed-dispersive solid phase extraction (r-dSPE) using C 18 . Recovery of polyoxin B ranged from 83.0% to 112.1% with relative standard deviation (RSD) ( n = 5) of 3.0–5.2%.

The dissipation experiments showed that half-lives of polyoxin B in cucumber and soil were 2.5–5.0 days. The terminal residues of polyoxin B at preharvest intervals (PHIs) of 3 days and 5 days in cucumber were less than 0.05 mg/kg. We therefore suggest that the developed method can be extrapolated to other agricultural crops or food for routine analysis. It also can be used to determine the PHIs. Moreover, these results will aid in establishing the maximum residue limit (MRL) for cucumber in China.",

Six benzoxazinoids were identified and quantitated in wheat varieties. Significant differences were observed among the examined varieties. The average concentrations of total researched compounds were definitely higher in the organically produced spring wheat cultivars than in the winter ones. The content of these compounds in the same varieties grown under organic and conventional systems showed their higher content under the organic one. The main benzoxazinoids detected in wheat varieties were 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside (DIMBOA-Glc) and 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA).

In this study, the 80% ethanol elution fraction from extract by AB-8 macroporous resin column chromatography was demonstrated to have anticancer activity on human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells in vitro. Then, a high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method was successfully established for separation of compounds by using hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (10:4:10:10, v / v / v / v ) as the solvent system.

An optimal chromatographic separation was achieved by using a mobile phase of acetonitrile: 0.25% acetic acid in water (12.5:78.5, v/v) and detection at 330 nm. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) for the six caffeoylquinic acid standards were in the range of 0.078–0.653 and 0.259–1.795 μg/mL, respectively. The accuracies of the developed method were in the range of 96.84–103.08%, while the corresponding precisions were between 0 and 2.94% for both within-day and between-day analyses, indicating that the method is repeatable and reliable. The mean recoveries were between 87.08 and 117.83%. The method was successfully applied for quantification of caffeoylquinic acids in G. procumbens plant samples. This is the first study on di-caffeoylquinic acids quantification in G. procumbens . Leaves samples contained higher amount of the caffeoylquinic acids compared to stem samples. Of the compounds, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid was found to be the major compound in almost all G. procumbens samples. The method has advantages such as sensitive ultraviolet (UV) detection, short run time with simple isocratic elution system compared to other methods which involved the use of costly instruments, laborious procedures with long run time and complex gradient system. This method can be further extended for routine quality control and analysis of plants or herbal products containing the caffeoylquinic acids.",

An optimized solid-phase extraction method of GLM in human plasma with excellent extraction recovery, 100 ± 0.06%, was achieved using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and Gliclazide (GLZ) as an internal standard. GLM was extracted from 100 µL plasma sample using Sep-Pak® vac 1cc (100 mg) C18 column and methylene chloride: methanol (2: 1, v/v) as eluant. Both GLM and GLZ were monitored by a triple quad mass spectrometer applying positive multiple reaction monitoring mode (+MRM).

Optimization was accomplished using chemometric tools such as the Design Space (DS) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Central Composite Design (CCD) and DS were applied for the optimization of the chromatographic procedure as well as the robustness of the chromatographic method by taking the ratio of the percentage of acetonitrile (%ACN) Buffer solution, the pH and the mobile phase flow rate as critical parameters. Satisfactory results were obtained after the optimization phase with a percentage of mobile phase equal to 46.19%, a pH of 4.16 and the flow rate is 1.4 mL min −1 by setting the resolution limits above 6, and the target retention time of 20 min. Using the DS and CCD approach, we have developed a robust and reliable procedure for the simultaneous and accurate separation and quantification of the five statins.",

One was observed with the non-linear concentration changes of the monomeric L -Cys and the non-linear yields of the L -Cys derived peptides, when undergoing spontaneous non-linear peptidization. The other one was observed with the binary L -Phe- L -Pro system, and the third one with L -Ser, D -Ser, and DL -Ser. So far, no analogous reports have been released on the circadian rhythm of the spontaneous non-linear peptidization of proteinogenic amino acids in a sterile abiotic environment (70% aqueous acetonitrile, or 70% aqueous methanol solutions). At the moment, we cannot find any rational explanation of this phenomenon, yet it seems highly probable that its origin is analogous to or even of a primordial nature for the circadian rhythm phenomena abundantly found in biological samples by other researchers. An experimentally established lack of the circadian rhythm with peptidization of the non-proteinogenic amino acid ( D -Ser) can encourage us to revisit a still unsolved question of homochirality preconditions.",

These new stationary phases exhibit efficiencies of at least 2.3 × 10 3 plates per meter. Abraham solvation parameter model was used to evaluate the solvation characteristics. The system constants indicated that the dipolarity/polarizability and the hydrogen-bond basicity play a major role among five molecular interactions between stationary phases and solute molecules. A fundamental understanding into the solvation characteristics of these GILs can be used as a guide to choosing the appropriate geminal ionic liquids for specific applications in various fields. The chromatographic separation performance was evaluated by a Grob test mixture, n-alkanes, alcohols, and aromatic isomers. Furthermore, the thermal stability was tested.

    "abstract": "Summary In our earlier investigations we showed, for the first time, with numerous practical examples that α-substituted propionic acids dissolved in the low-molecular-weight solvents are able to undergo spontaneous oscillatory in-vitro chiral conversion. In this study, we focused on attempting to suppress the spontaneous oscillatory in-vitro chiral conversion of α-substituted propionic acids using, as example, l-lactic acid dissolved in water in the presence of copper(II) cations. Our intention was to check whether the coordinate covalent bonds between copper(II) and l-lactic acid ligands prevented the latter species from oscillatory chiral conversion. To do this we stored aqueous solutions of copper(II) acetate and lactic acid in the molar ratios 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 for a long period of time. Scrutiny of possible chiral conversion of l-lactic acid was carried out by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), polarimetry, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Seemingly contradictory results were obtained from our investigations. From the TLC data it was apparent that chelating of copper(II) cations with l-lactic acid molecules did not result in suppression of the spontaneous oscillatory in-vitro chiral conversion of the acid. It was also established that different molar proportions of copper(II) cation and l-lactic acid molecules had somewhat different effects on the dynamics of conversion. In contrast, from polarimetric and circular dichroism studies it was apparent that when l-lactic acid is dissolved in water in the presence of copper(II) cations almost no chiral conversion is observed. Hence a final conclusion was drawn that chelating of copper(II) cations with l-lactic acid stabilizes the chiral structure of the acid in solution. Intermolecular interactions between the copper(II)-l-lactic acid complex and the silica gel stationary phase evidently affects the structure of the complex, however, most probably resulting in partial “liberation” of l-lactic acid ligands. Thus the chiral structure-stabilizing effect of copper(II) cations is apparently weakened by the TLC system and the freed l-lactic acid molecules can undergo chiral conversion.",

Central composite design and Derringer's desirability function were used to optimize the concentration of KOH and the volume of ethyl acetate as the main factors affecting the liquid-liquid extraction procedure. After extraction, the analytes were separated quantitatively on a C18 column with 10 mM pH 7.0 phosphate buffer-methanol-acetonitrile 48.46:20:31.54 (υ/υ) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.20 mL min−1 and with UV detection at 285 nm. It was concluded that extraction recovery of both the analytes was affected by KOH concentration and that recovery of pantoprazole was affected by ethyl acetate (extraction solvent) volume. Extraction recovery under optimum extraction conditions was 93.52% for domperidone and 92.72% for pantoprazole. The optimized extraction method was validated. Linearity was established for six levels in the ranges 10–1000 ng mL−1 for pantoprazole and 15–1000 ng mL−1 for domperidone. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) and detection (LOD) were estimated as 9.84 and 5.91 ng mL−1, respectively, for pantoprazole and 14.56 and 8.79 ng mL−1 for domperidone. The optimized method was linear, specific, accurate, and precise; the high recovery (>92%) and low relative standard deviation (<2.5%) enable reliable quantification of these analytes in spiked human plasma.",

    "abstract": "Summary In a previous study we provided thin-layer chromatographic, polarimetric, and other experimental evidence that phenylglycine can undergo easy spontaneous peptidization in abiotic aqueous media. From our unpublished results it is apparent that this behaviour is also characteristic of some other amino acids (e.g., alanine and phenylalanine). It seems highly probable that this abiotic peptidization of amino acids dissolved in aqueous media is directly linked to their ability to undergo spontaneous oscillatory chiral conversion. In our earlier research it was also shown that spontaneous oscillatory chiral conversion was characteristic not only of amino acids but also of several other classes of carboxylic acid, including profen drugs and hydroxy acids. We therefore decided to check whether selected chiral hydroxy acids — lactic acid and mandelic acid — previously recognized for their ability to undergo spontaneous oscillatory chiral conversion, could also furnish the respective polyacids. Condensation of hydroxy acids can be viewed as a reaction fully analogous with peptidization of amino acids and, hence, it seemed to us highly probable that it also can be triggered by oscillatory chiral conversion. In our study, we used thin-layer chromatography and 13C NMR spectroscopy to check whether formation of polylactic acid and polymandelic acid occurred in stored solutions of lactic and mandelic acids. By means of polarimetry with continuous recording we provided experimental evidence that all three hydroxy acids investigated (i.e. l-(+)-lactic acid, S-(+)-mandelic acid, and R-(−)-mandelic acid) undergo continuous chiral conversion. From the thin-layer chromatographic results obtained it was apparent that — similar to the spontaneous and instantaneous peptidization of amino acids — the hydroxy acids investigated also undergo easy condensation to form the respective polyacids. 13C NMR spectroscopy provided additional experimental confirmation of this.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new, sensitive, stability-indicating reversed-phase HPLC method was validated and applied for the simultaneous quantitation of sodium valproate and two paraben preservatives; methylparaben, and propylparaben in the liquid dosage form. Stability tests were carried out through exposure of the analyte's solution to stress conditions. Separation of the analytes was achieved on (waters) C18 Column (150 mm × 3.9 mm, 5 μm). A mixture of 0.05 M monobasic potassium phosphate pH 3.5 and acetonitrile (50:50; v/v) was applied at 1.5 ml/min flow rate and UV detection wavelength at 210 nm. The degradation products and the analytes were completely separated. The linearity was performed in the range of 50–150 % from a target concentration of 10 μg/ml propylparaben, 90 μg/ml methylparaben, and 2.88 mg/ml sodium valproate with a coefficient correlation (R 2 ) 1.0 for methylparaben, propylparaben and sodium valproate. The validation results of the suggested method were in a good agreement with ICH guidelines. Application of the proposed method for analysis of liquid dosage forms was successfully carried out in the routine quality control process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Statins drugs are thought to be among the most prescribed drugs worldwide for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. A simple and reliable RP-HPLC method has been successfully employed for simultaneously separating and qualifying three statin drugs including atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin in pharmaceutical tablets. The optimal conditions were mobile phase 50:50 (v/v) (formic acid pH 2.50: ETOH), column temperature 40.00 °C, detection wavelength 238.00 nm, and flow rate 1.00 mL/min. The proposed method has been validated based on the ICH guidelines in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, and limit of detection and limit of quantification. The linear range investigated 2.0–80.0, 4.0–100.00, and 12.00–120.00 µg/mL for rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin respectively with coefficients of determination (R 2 ) within the range of 0.9993–0.9995. The LOD and LOQ for rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin were (1.57, 4.76 µg/mL), (1.87, 5.66 µg/mL), (3.46, 10.49 µg/mL) respectively. In addition, in order to evaluate the feasibility of the method developed, it was employed towards the quantification of the pharmaceutical tablets for the analytes investigated and excellent recovery was obtained.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oral anticoagulants are a group of drugs used for the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolism. For the last ten years, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been available and are equally effective, but significantly safer than vitamin K antagonists. In the case of an overdose, their most important side effect is still bleeding. Due to their widespread use, as well as increased toxicological importance there is a need to develop an analytical method for the determination of DOAC in biological material. The aim of this paper was to establish a method for the quantification of apixaban as one of the representatives of DOAC. The methodology of the study included the measurement of apixaban in the plasma of patients treated in the intensive care unit. Plasma apixaban concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS technique using carbamazepine as an internal standard. Obtained validation parameters indicate that the introduced method is sensitive, reliable, precise and accurate. Using this method, apixaban can be quickly and easily detected and quantified in plasma in patients who are suspected of overdosing with this drug.",

It is an important medicinal herb native to Northern Himalaya and commonly known as ‘daruharidra’, ‘daruhaldi’, ‘Indian barberry’ or ‘tree turmeric’. An insight into the research literature uncovered reports on isoquinoline alkaloids like magnoflorine, berbamine, columbamine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, and berberine as major bioactives in B. aristata roots, possessing different pharmacological and therapeutic effects. In the present study, these aforementioned alkaloids were separated on Phenomenex Luna®, 5 µm-C8 analytical column. The HPLC-MS analysis was performed at a flow rate of 0.90 mL min −1 . Each alkaloid that is resolved was characterized by precursor ions and fragment ions with electrospray ionization (ESI) source in both positive and negative ionization using scan mode. The limit of detections (LODs) were 0.087, 0.727, 0.035, 0.124, 0.782 and 0.794 μg mL −1 for magnoflorine, berbamine, columbamine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine and berberine, respectively. The proposed UHPLC-PDA method was fully validated according to international (ICH) guidelines and was found to be selective, sensitive and highly accurate for the concomitant estimation of the aforementioned symbolic bio-markers of B. aristata roots.",

It can be concluded that the use of weighted and moderately robust regression technique increases correlation between extrapolated retention and real lipophilicity, whereas polynomial and very robust techniques give visibly worse results due to their excessive flexibility and higher extrapolation uncertainty. Additionally, we have compared averaging retention from different modifiers by RF, k, and RM values. The results are similar; however, surprisingly, RF averaging performs slightly better to the other approaches.",

Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) isomers were determined by sensitive isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method which is characterized by a low limit of detection (1 pg g−1 fresh weight). The recovery values obtained for individual isomers were in the range of 89–124%. The γ-HBCD isomer was detected in all samples. This isomer also had the largest percentage in comparison with the other isomers, except in salmon, in which the α-HBCD isomer was more abundant. The highest level of total HBCD was measured in mackerel (650 ± 195 pg g−1 fresh weight). Cluster analysis allowed the differentiation of groups of objects and the display of objects based on the degree of integration within the same group. Spearman’s rank correlation indicated no statistically significant difference between the levels of HBCD and the fat content in the fish samples.",

The purity index for the gemifloxacin peak after all types of stress was >0.999, indicating complete separation of the analyte peak from the degradation products. The method can therefore be regarded as stability-indicating. It is rapid, and suitable for purity and assay determination not only for routine quality control but also in stability studies.",

The influence of some key factors on the chiral recognition ability of MIPs, such as the type of functional monomers and porogen and the molar ratio of template to monomer, was systematically investigated. The chromatographic conditions, such as mobile phase composition, sample loading, and flow rate, were also measured. The chiral separation for DABN racemates under the optimum chromatographic conditions by using MIP chiral stationary phase (CSP) of P3, prepared with the S-DABN/MAA ratio = 1/4 and used acetonitrile (2 mL) and chloroform (4 mL) as porogen, showed the highest separation factor (2.14).

The camellia pollen extracts prepared with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and n -BuOH have tyrosinase inhibitory activity.

Three fractions with tyrosinase inhibitory activity were separated from the hydrolysate by a one-step HSCCC procedure. Among the fractions, two chemicals were sufficiently purified and identified to be levulinic acid (LA) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF).

Serine or anthranilic acid was used at the concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 g/L of medium. Determination of indole compounds in the obtained biomass was carried out using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with densitometric detection. In every analyzed sample, presence of serine or anthranilic acid was studied. Comparison of the results obtained for the treatment and control samples allowed us to determine the optimum concentration of serine or anthranilic acid in the medium in order to obtain biomass with increased content of indole compounds. A. bisporus with addition of anthranilic acid or serine to the medium at the concentration of 0.5 g/L was the most beneficial. In the case of Imleria badia , anthranilic acid at the concentration of 0.5 g/L was the most optimal. This is the first report demonstrating the content of indole derivatives in biomass affected by their precursors (serine or anthranilic acid). The study indicates that modification of the medium can provide satisfactory results, and it is worth to search for its new, improved compositions.",

Various parameters which influenced derivatization and elusion were optimized. The chromatographic system consisted of C-18 column with ultraviolet (UV)—photodiode array detection ranging from 210 to 400 nm.

The concentration of the triterpenoid was found to be 8.64 ppm in 2000 ppm of the extract, assuming that all the components are eluted.",

For this purpose, monosized-porous poly(glycerol dimethacrylate-co-glycerol-1,3-diglycerolate diacrylate), poly(GDMA-co-GDGDA), beads with hydroxyl functionality were synthesized by a modified seeded polymerization. The selected octadecylating agent, stearoyl chloride (SC), was covalently attached onto the hydrophilic beads via a direct, single stage reaction with a simple synthetic route.

    "abstract": "Abstract Perampanel (PER) is the first clinically available selective antagonist of α -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor approved globally for the treatment of epilepsy. Studies have recently underlined the significant association between dose-exposure-effect-adverse events of PER in patients with epilepsy, so the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of PER is critical in clinical practices, especially for pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Due to several limits in previous published analytical methods, herein, we describe the development and validation of a novel liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for monitoring PER in human plasma samples. Protein precipitation method by acetonitrile containing PER-d5 as internal standard was applied for the sample clean-up. Formic acid (FA, 0.2 mM) in both aqueous water and acetonitrile were used as the mobile phases and the analyte was separated by an isocratic elution. Qualification and quantification were performed under positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode using the m/z 350.3 → 219.1 and 355.3 → 220.0 ions pairs transitions for PER and PER-d5, respectively. Potential co-medicated anti-seizure medications (ASMs) have no interference to the analysis. Calibration curves were linear in the concentration range of 1.00–2,000 ng mL −1 for PER. The intra- and inter-batch precision, accuracy, recovery, dilution integrity, and stability of the method were all within the acceptable criteria and no matrix effect or carryover was found. This method was then successfully implemented on the TDM of PER in Chinese children with drug-resistant epilepsy. We firstly confirmed the apparent inter- and intra-individual PER concentration variabilities and potential drug-drug interactions between PER and several concomitant ASMs occurred in Chinese pediatric patients, which were also in line with previous studies in patients of other race.",

Therefore, it is necessary to accurately detect PAHs in various sample matrices, which requires precise, practical, and rapid detection methods. The purpose of this research is to develop a high sensitivity analysis method by analyzing the optimum excitation and emission wavelengths of EPA's 15 priority polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the UHPLC fluorescence detector (Acenaphthene, Anthracene, Benzo[a]anthracene, Benzo[b]fluoranthene, Benzo[k]fluoranthene, Benzo[ghi]perylene, Benzo[a]pyrene, Chrysene, Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, Fluoranthene, Fluorene, Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, Naphthalene, Phenanthrene, and Pyrene). An average of 17–25 analyses were performed for each polyaromatic hydrocarbon, and optimized excitation and emission wavelengths were obtained. LOD levels between 2 and 90 ppt were obtained with the method created in this direction. It is worth mentioning that the limits achieved for some PAH parameters are lower than those reported in the literature after pre-concentration steps.",

This study aims to analyze the presence of ten synthetic colors (namely, (allura red (E129), amaranth (E123), sunset yellow (E110), tetrazine (E102), fast green (E143), ponceau 4R (New Coccine) (E124), erythrosin B (E127), brilliant blue FCF (E133), brilliant black (E151) and carmoisine (E122))) in food and drink samples using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography diode array detection (UHPLC-DAD). The present analytical method was carried out using Agilent Poroshell 120 HPH-C18 column, 3 × 100 mm, 2.7 µm, and a mobile phase consisting of 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7, mixed with methanol as a time-increment gradient solution until the time was 20 min, then decreased with time until the time was 26 min. The pH was set by orthophosphoric acid at 7 and 5 μL injection volume, 0.50 mL flow rate, and the elution systems were monitored at 428 nm for E102, 518 nm for E124, E110, E129, E122, 530 nm for E151, E127, 622 nm for E143, and E133, respectively. The limit of detection and quantification for all colors ranged from 0.017 to 0.025 and 0.057 and 0.082 mg L −1 , respectively. The correlation coefficient values ranged between 0.9991 and 1.0. The selectivity of the assay revealed no interference from other components in the analyzed samples. The percent recovery and precision (intra- and inter-day) of the spiked samples were within the acceptable limits of the ICH guidelines. Five analytical parameters were employed, and the results showed a new, novel, and robust method according to ICH guidelines for analyzing these colors. While most of the investigated food and drinks fell within the accepted range, some fell outside. The current sample preparation and analytical methods are comprehensive and universal for extracting and measuring synthetic colors in various food and drink samples.",

In the HPLC method, 10 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution (pH: 2.0) and ethanol (50:50, V/V) were used as mobile phases, isocratic elution was applied at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min −1 and detection was made at 304 nm. In the spectrophotometric method, the spectral patterns of standard solutions in different solvents were comprehensively examined, the best spectra were obtained with ultrapure water, and a wavelength of 304 nm was selected for detection. Both methods have been validated according to ICH guidelines for various parameters. Correlation coefficients greater than 0.999 were determined for both methods in the concentration range of 5–30 μg mL −1 . The developed methods were applied to commercial formulations, and comparisons of the results were made using the Student (t) test for means and the Fischer (F) test for standard deviations. No statistically significant difference was observed between the methods. The greenness evaluation of these methods was carried out using AGREE software. The developed methods are proposed as excellent environmental and operator-friendly alternatives for the quantification of Lenalidomide in pharmaceutical formulations.",

Various conditions affecting the adsorption of Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , Ag + , and Hg 2+ on β-Nap-PUF were studied. Maximum adsorption of Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ , Ag + , and Hg 2+ on β-Nap-PUF was in the pH ranges 3–9, 4–10, 9–10, and 1–5, respectively. Extraction of these metal ions followed first-order rate equations and the average values of k1, kM, and t1/2 at room temperature were calculated 0.17 min −1 , 4.68 µmol g −1 min −1/2 , and 5.08 min, respectively. Uptake of the metal ions on the β-Nap-PUF was determined as a function of metal ion concentration in solution and the results were analyzed in terms of the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Dubinin Radushkevich models. Measurement of variation of adsorption of the metal ions with temperature yielded average values of ∆H, ∆S, ∆G, and ∆E of −21.4 kJ mol −1 , −47.8 J K −1 mol −1 , −5.9 kJ mol −1 and 9.1 kJ mol −1 , respectively.

Accuracy and precision were acceptable — for all the analytes recovery was 82.0–93.0% and repeatability, as relative standard deviation, was 1.0–3.0%. Hydrolytic stability tests indicated MIT and DIT are much more stable than the other analytes. rT3 was not released directly from iodinated casein but was formed by deiodination of T4 during hydrolysis. The method could be used to identify iodinated casein, to evaluate its activity and quality, and for supervision and regulation of feed additives.",

Herein, the conditions for the extraction of DPT from A. sylvestris are optimized using a Box–Behnken design (BBD) method based on response surface methodology (RSM). DPT was detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array and quadrupole detector (UPLC–PDA–QDa) and analytical validation methods based on International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. In preliminary experiments, the experimental conditions of extraction time, solvent percentage, and temperature were selected for optimization.

The drugs individually, and in combination, were analyzed using a Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC coupled with 2996 photodiode array detector (PDA). Successful separation of combined drugs was achieved by gradient elution on a reverse-phase C-18 Phenomenex Luna column, using a mobile phase consisting of water and methanol at detection wavelength of 254 nm. The HPLC retention times were consistent at ±7.70 min, ±8.25 min, and ±10.70 min for RIF, 25ODESRIF, and NEO, respectively. The regression data for the calibration plots exhibited linear relationship ( R 2 = 0.995) in the range of 0–200 μM for both RIF and 25ODESRIF, and the lower limit of detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were calculated at 5.86 μM and 17.75 μM for RIF and 7.78 μM and 23.57 μM for 25ODESRIF, respectively. The method was evaluated using in vitro human liver microsomes (HLMs) assays, and linearity was established for the 15, 30, 45, and 60 min incubations ( R 2 = 0.99). The formation of 25ODESRIF was characterized by hyperbolic kinetics ( K m 48.23 μM, V max 1.233 pmol/min/mg protein, and CL int 0.026 μl/min/mg protein). The method was applied in HLM assays to understand the herb–drug interaction (HDI) potential of Althaea officinalis , a popular African herb consumed by tuberculosis (TB) patients, with RIF. None of the extracts of A. officinalis inhibited the esterase-mediated metabolism pathway of RIF, compared to the positive control nelfinavir (IC 50 = 9.59 μM). The method provides a tool for quantifying RIF and 25ODESRIF in in vitro drug metabolism assays as well as investigating herb– and drug–drug interactions (DDIs).",

The compounds have been chromatographed on RP-18 and on cyano-bonded silica chromatographic phases with eluents containing water and an organic modifier (methanol, dioxane, acetone, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran) of various concentrations. Statistically proved linear relationships between the retention parameter (RM) and the concentration of organic modifier in the mobile phase allow the extrapolation procedure to obtain RM0 for investigated compounds. The correlations between both the values of the intercept (RM0) and the slope (S) from the linear equation, taken as a measure of the lipophilicity, were calculated. The experimentally established parameters of lipophilicity (RM0) were compared with the log P values calculated by use of four different software packages. The values of the correlation coefficients of these relationships are higher for the cyanopropyl phase than for RP-18. Moreover, in this work the influences of different mobile phase modifiers and adsorbent layers on experimentally obtained lipophilicity parameters were analyzed and compared. Generally, the best correlations were obtained for systems with the cyanopropyl-bonded stationary phase in comparison with RP-18.",

    "abstract": "Acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), as the major drug consumed in the world, has been combined with other various drugs. In this regard, ASA-rosuvastatin is the most recent combination. The current article reported the first two separation methods for the assay of that combination utilizing sequential injection chromatography (SIC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The optimization process was conducted for SIC, and the optimum conditions were then adapted to HPLC. Both methods, SIC and HPLC, were validated and successfully applied to tablet formulation. In both methods, the analytes were chromatographed onto a short C18 monolithic column (4.6 × 25 mm) by a mobile phase composition of 10 mmol L−1 phosphate:acetonitrile: methanol (50:30:20, v/v/v at pH 3.0). The performances of both methods were compared. The remarkable advantages of the SIC method over HPLC method were the reduction in reagent consumption and instrumentation simplicity and cost-effectiveness. The total volume of mobile phase consumed is three orders of magnitude larger in HPLC than that in SIC. Other analytical features of the SIC and HPLC methods were comparable and acceptable for pharmaceutical analysis. Accordingly, the SIC method could be more suitable for routine analysis of simple matrices after examining the capability of the technique to work under industrial conditions.",

The phenolic components of pomegranate are believed to be responsible for their antioxidant activities, hence playing a major role in reducing oxidative stress-related disease, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used to, first, separate and identify the phenolic constituents of pomegranate juice and, second, to assess the antioxidant efficacies of the identified compounds. Different oxidant and hydroxyl radical generating systems (Fe3+, Cu2+, H2O2, Fe2+-H2O2, and Cu2+-H2O2) were used in assessing the efficacies of phenolic compounds found in pomegranate juice. A 10 × 10 cm and 20 × 20 cm sized silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates with toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid (60:40:10 v/v/v) as a mobile phase were used for the chromatographic separation. Two compounds, ellagic acid and gallic acid, were separated and identified. When pomegranate juice was challenged with the oxidant systems, it was observed that the phenolic compounds slowly disappeared in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. From the results, it was concluded that gallic acid had a higher antioxidant efficacy than ellagic acid. TLC has been applied for the first time to outline the antioxidant profile of pomegranate juice and assess the efficacies of phenolics using different oxidant systems, including redox-active metals and H2O2.",

Structural analog, derivative of 1,3-propanediamine, was used as an internal standard (IS). Sample preparation employed protein precipitation by acetonitrile and subsequent centrifugation. Optimal UHPLC separation conditions were set to achieve simultaneous determination of both compounds in a short run time of 6 min. Additionally, the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode developed in this method allowed a highly sensitive, accurate, and precise identification of compounds of interest. The lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 1.3 ng mL −1 for DE-EDCP and 0.3 μg mL −1 for EDCP. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 1.3–26.7 ng mL −1 and 0.3–6.7 μg mL −1 for DE-EDCP and EDCP, respectively. Precision (%CV) and accuracy (%RE) for DE-EDCP and EDCP ranged from 3.5% to 16.0% and from 1.8% to 14.4%, respectively. The validation process was performed in accordance with the regulatory guidance/guideline, and all of the obtained results met the established acceptance criteria.

A series of l-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ILs differing in anion and cation compositions was evaluated for extraction efficiency, and [C3MIM]Br was selected as the optimal solvent. In addition, ultrasound extraction parameters were optimized, and the chromones were directly quantified and analyzed by rapid resolution liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (RRLC-ESI/MS). The optimal conditions were as follows: 0.4 M concentration of [C3MIM]Br, 20:1 solvent to solid ratio, and ultrasonic time, temperature, and frequency of 5 min, 40 °C, and 50 kHz, respectively. This approach obtained the highest extraction yield of 10.188 ± 0.473 mg g −1 for total chromones. Compared with regular UAE, the proposed approach exhibited a higher efficiency (61.56% increase) and shorter extraction time (nine times shorter). Also, ILUAE was an efficient, rapid, and simple sample preparation technique for extraction of chromones, and the established RRLC-DAD method could serve as a rapid and effective technique for extracting chromones from Radix Saposhnikoviae.",

The method of 2D gel image matching proposed in a previous paper [1] is based on fuzzy alignment of features extracted from gels’ images and enables both global and local interpolation of the image grid, followed by brightness interpolation. There are two types of pixel coordinate mapping (forward and inverse) and the choice of mapping method might affect the quality of the results obtained. In this paper the two types of grid mapping method are compared.",

It was found that use of a small amount of water as mobile phase additive can improve or prevent enantioseparation, depending on the column. The order of elution of the linezolid enantiomers was different on the Chiracel OD and Chiralpak AD columns, and baseline resolution was achieved on the Chiralpak AD column only. Reversal of the order of elution of the enantiomers on changing from the propanols to ethanol was observed on both columns. The effect of temperature (in the narrow range 15–35°C) on retention and enantioselectivity was studied for both columns and a variety of mobile phases. The standard enthalpy (∆H°) and entropy (∆S°) changes for solute transfer between the mobile and stationary phases were also estimated.",

To characterize the structure of a peptide quantitatively, and then to predict its retention time under gradient HPLC conditions, the structural descriptors used were: the logarithm of the sum of retention times of the amino acids of the peptide, log SumAA; the logarithm of the Van der Waals volume of the peptide, log VDWVol; and the logarithm of its calculated n-octanol–water partition coefficient, clog P. The predictive power of the QSRR model was checked by use of a myoglobin digest, after separation and identification of the peptides by LC–ESI-MS–MS. On-line protein digestion was performed by use of trypsin immobilized on an epoxy-modified silica monolithic support coupled on-line to LC–ESIMS–MS. The predicted gradient retention times of the peptides were related to the experimental retention times obtained after on-line digestion of myoglobin. Identification of the components of the protein digest was supported by QSRR analysis. The QSRR approach was used as an additional constraint in proteomic research to verify results from MS–MS ion search, and to confirm both correctness of peptide identifications and indications of potential false positive and false negative results. The results suggest that because of the use of QSRR for prediction of peptide retention, information derived from standard liquid chromatographic separation in proteomics research could also be useful for eventual identification of the peptides.",

Characterization of phenolic profiles of the leading wheat cultivars is important for new opportunities for breeding and eventual commercial production of value-added cultivars rich in beneficial components. A method using ultra-performance liquid chromatography combined with photodiode-array detector–electrospray ion source–mass spectrometry (UPLC–PDA–ESI–MS) has been developed for determination of phenolic compounds contained in twelve winter and thirteen spring wheat varieties. The antioxidant activity was determined by the thin-layer chromatography–2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (TLC–DPPH • ) test with image processing by means of the ImageJ program. Based on retention time, the mass of deprotonated molecule [M−H] − and ultraviolet (UV) spectra, seven phenolic acids, and twelve flavonoids were identified and quantitated in the 80% aqueous methanol extract of the wheat varieties. The average concentrations of total researched compounds were definitely higher in spring wheat cultivars than in winter ones. Varieties Trappe and Kandela showed the most elevated values of total free phenolic acids. Kandela and Ostka Smolicka had the highest content of flavonoids, and isoorientin was detected as the main phenolic in wheat cultivars. Additionally, a correlation between radical scavenging activity and total phenolic acids content was observed. UPLC combined with PDA–ESI–MS could be applied to complete characterization of natural products (e.g., phenolics) in alcoholic extracts from wheat varieties.",

    "abstract": "A hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME), followed by high-performance liquid chromatography–ultraviolet (HPLC–UV) method for the trace determination of carvedilol (β-blocker) in biological fluids, has been described. The separation was achieved using Inertsil ODS-3 C 18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm) column with a mobile phase composition of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 4.0)–acetonitrile (50:50, v / v ) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, under isocratic elution. Several parameters (i.e., type of organic solvent, donor phase pH, concentration of acceptor phase (AP), stirring rate, extraction time, and salt addition) that affect the extraction efficiency were investigated. The optimum HF-LPME conditions were as follows: dihexyl ether as an organic solvent; donor phase pH, 10.7; 0.1 M HCl (AP); 1100-rpm stirring rate; 60-min extraction time; and no salt addition. These parameters have been confirmed using design of experiments. Under these conditions, an enrichment factor of 273-fold was achieved. Good linearity and correlation coefficient were obtained over the range 5–1000 ng/mL ( r 2 = 0.9994). Limits of detection and quantitation were 1.2 and 3.7 ng/mL, respectively. The relative standard deviation at 3 different concentration levels (5, 500, and 1000 ng/mL) were less than 13.2%. Recoveries for spiked urine and plasma were in the range 80.7–114%. The proposed method is simple, sensitive, and suitable for the determination of carvedilol in biological fluids.",

These films of β-CD-PVA-GA electrospun fibers are characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which were subsequently used for thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-based enantiomeric separation of histidine and serine pairs. Amino acids were detected by spraying the chromatograms with the ninhydrin solution. Among various solvent systems employed, it was found that the separation of serine enantiomers with a resolution of 1.6 was possible with the mobile phase ethanol–butanol–ethyl acetate–water–acetone (4:5:5:0.5:1.5, v / v ), and histidine enantiomers with a resolution of 1.4 were possible with the mobile phase ethanol–butanol–ethyl acetate–water–acetone (4:5:4.5:0.5:1.5, v / v ). This proves that the prepared stationary phase is efficient in enatioresolution of selected amino acid pairs and can be further examined for physiological samples.",

Stepwise optimization and factors affecting separation are properly discussed. Different factors were optimized such as stationary phase, selection of organic solvent and its content, buffer pH and concentration, flow rate, elution type and detection wavelength. The studied drugs were efficiently separated in 3.4 min with high resolution. Also, two univariate spectrophotometric methods have been optimized for the quantification of the studied drugs. Method 1: dual wavelength for THZ and iso-absorptive point for FLM, Method 2: ratio difference (RD) for THZ and first derivative FLM utilizing methanol as a solvent. These methods are accurate, precise with minimal data manipulation. Greenness of the methods was estimated using eco-scale tool where the presented methods were found to be excellent green with eco-score of 83 for HPLC and 80 for spectrophotometry. The methods are validated in conformance with ICH guidelines, with acceptable accuracy, precision, and selectivity. The suggested methods can be employed for the economic analysis of THZ and FLM in their pure form and binary ophthalmic formulation, that can be employed by quality control laboratories.",

In the present work, a method is described for the separation evaluation of three selected organophosphorus fungicides (OPFs) ditalimfos (D), edifenfos (E), and tolclofos-methyl (TM) by reversed-phase high-performance thin-layer chromatography (RP-HPTLC). The method is based on the separation of three OPFs on silica gel 60 RP-18WF254 plates with varying mobile phase compositions (10:0–6:4) of methanol-water. The relationship between the mobile phase composition and retention parameters (RF and RM) as well as separation parameters (ΔRF, RS, α, RFα) was analyzed. The three OPFs are completely separated from each other with ΔRF ≥ 0.04, except for the pair of compounds E-TM in the mobile phase composition 10:0, 7:3, 6.5:3.5, and 6:4. Under the chromatographic conditions used, TM was adsorbed the strongest, followed by E and D, which is indicated by the higher RM values obtained for TM. Peak resolution (RS) values greater than 1.5 were obtained over the entire range of mobile phase composition, except for the pair of compounds E-TM. The UV apex of maximum absorption was 200 nm for all the three OPFs as measured by multiwave-length scan in the UV range, and higher values of peak area and peak height were obtained at the same wavelength. The present study clearly indicates that the system of RPHPTLC with mobile phase methanol-water in a volume composition 8:2 (υ/υ) provides the optimum conditions for the separation of the three OPFs. However, the complete separation of E from TM was not achieved using this system.",

From the literature, we learnt that spontaneous condensation of certain chiral compounds sometimes can be oscillatory in nature. Thus, we considered it noteworthy to check if spontaneous condensation of the chiral low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids follows a linear or a nonlinear dynamic pattern. In this paper, we present the results of our studies on the dynamics of condensation of S-, R-, and rac-mandelic acid, carried out with the aid of the high-performance liquid chromatography with the diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD), and with the aid of mass spectrometry (MS). The obtained data furnish reliable evidence that condensation of mandelic acid is oscillatory in nature. Finally, a theoretical model is recalled, which jointly describes the oscillatory chiral conversion and the oscillatory condensation with S-, R-, and rac-mandelic acid.",

Because of the complexity of the cyclotide matrix in V. ignobilis and the presence of their different isomers, suitable separations could not be obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Also, a miniaturized column with a powerful determination technique, such as nanoliquid chromatography-Fourier transform mass spectroscopy (nano-LC-FTMS), could not succeed in the identification of all the cyclotides. Thus, a multidimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC), in the heart-cutting and mixed-bed modes, has been developed to separate the cyclotides. In the heart-cutting MDLC, the C8-C18 and C8-CN conditions were investigated and a good resolution could be obtained for the isolation of a few specific peaks. In the mixed-bed mode, a C8-CN condition was investigated and good separation was obtained by a gradient condition. The results of these methods are compared.",

A validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (UPLC-DAD) method was developed for the quantification of taxodione in a hexane extract taken from genetically transformed roots of S. austriaca. The developed UPLC-DAD method demonstrated good linearity in the range 10–500 μg mL−1 (r2 = 0.99988), high precision (relative standard deviation (RSD) <1.42%), and good repeatability (RSD <1.84%).

    "abstract": "Drug analysis is among the most sensitive areas of chemical analysis, simply because of its relevance to human health. Profens make the most important group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in many countries some of them are freely sold over the counter. The in vitro liquid chromatographic analysis of profen drugs faces certain not commonly recognized yet acute and often impassable problems, due to the specific physicochemical properties of these compounds. In this mini review, we share our experience on the practical failures with the enantioseparation of profen drugs both by means of chiral planar and column chromatography. By use of such analytical techniques as polarimetry, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, we point out objectively the reasons that make liquid chromatographic enantioseparation of profens an almost impossible task. These compounds have an inherent ability (both in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions) to undergo oscillatory chiral conversion and oscillatory condensation, combined with a highly pronounced gelating ability. In our view, the oscillatory chiral conversion of profens questions the credibility of widespread claims on the superiority of the curative potential with the (+)-profens over that of the respective (−)-antimers (although the rightfulness of such claims cannot be dismissed, as the in vivo and in vitro behavior of many drugs are known to sometimes fundamentally differ). Moreover, it seems highly probable that, due to their highly pronounced gelating property, profen drugs can easily clog the blood vessels and thereby jeopardize living organisms.",

    "abstract": "Burning mine waste dumps release gases of significant content of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The main objective of the study was to determine the PAHs concentrations in gas sampled from the burning mine waste dump located in Ruda Śląska, Upper Silesia, Poland (N 50°16′46.2″; E 18°51′02.4″). Determination of the level of PAHs content in gas released from burning mine waste dumps is essential for an assessment of its potential environmental risk to human health and the environment. Gas sampling was conducted in 2011 using fixed sorbent type polyurethane foam with a quartz fiber filter and the aspirator. Burning zones were selected based on the assessment of a thermal activity, i.e., measurements of surface and subsurface (at the depth of 1 m) temperatures and determination of the composition of gas at the depth of 1 m (CO2, CO and O2 content). The techniques of pressure-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescence detector (FLD) were applied in the analyses of the samples. The Hierarchical Clustering Analysis enabled to explore the differences between the gaseous samples collected in five burning zones. The average total sum of PAHs content was 2.22 mg/m3. Naphthalene, fluorene and phenanthrene were the main components detected in gas samples, which is associated with their high volatility, when compared to other PAHs compounds. The heaviest PAHs (benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene) in all tested samples were not detected which may be attributed to decreasing evaporation with increasing molecular mass.",

Standards and test samples were applied on TLC aluminum plate precoated with 0.2 mm layer of silica gel 60F254. The plate was run in a twin glass chamber comprising toluene: methanol: chloroform (8:1:1, v/v/v ) as a mobile phase. The plates were immersed in anisaldehyde-sulfuric reagent and then heated at 105 °C for 5 min in CAMAG TLC plate heater for appearance of bands. Densitometric scanning was performed at λ max = 525 nm using tungsten light source in CAMAG TLC Scanner4 armed with WinCATS software. R F values of BS and LU standards and those of test samples were found to be 0.53 ± 0.01 and 0.63 ± 0.01 respectively. The method was further validated by following the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. For BS and LU, the linear regression data for the calibration plots revealed a satisfactory linear association with r 2 = 0.995 and 0.998, respectively. Linear range for both BS and LU was 200–600 ng/band. Accuracy of the method was evaluated by performing recovery study at three different levels by standard addition methods with an average recovery of 99.86% and 101.07%. The results revealed that the leaf samples of U. picta contained highest concentration of BS (0.150 ± 0.02%) while its root samples confined the highest concentration of LU (0.149 ± 0.01%).

Therefore, it has been known to be abused by students and parents as a “smart drug.” It is in the first category of psychotropic drugs and strictly controlled. To detect modafinil in rat plasma and study the differences in the pharmacokinetics of modafinil between oral and sublingual administration in rats, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed. Rats were injected with modafinil by oral gavage and sublingual vein, respectively, blood was collected within a certain period, and the plasma was obtained by centrifugation. Midazolam was used as the internal standard, and the concentration of modafinil in the plasma was determined by UPLC-MS/MS, where a drug-time curve was created to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters. The standard curve for modafinil ranged from 1 to 2000 ng mL −1 with good linearity. The intra-day accuracy of modafinil was between 86% and 104%, and the intra-day accuracy was between 90% and 103%. Intra-day precision (RSD%) was less than 15%, inter-day precision (RSD%) was less than 15%. The matrix effect was between 93% and 102%, and the recovery was greater than 91%. The UPLC-MS/MS method established in this work has good selectivity and high sensitivity, and the UPLC-MS/MS method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetics of modafinil by oral gavage and sublingual injection in rats. The bioavailability of modafinil was calculated to be 55.8%.",

The advancement of bioanalytical methods brought a dynamic field with exciting opportunities for future research. The current review emphasis the bioanalytical methods employed for the quantitative estimation of Hydrochlorothiazide as monotherapy and its popularly used combinational medications available from 1956 to till date. A fixed dose of 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide with 43 combinational medications is currently available in the market and these combinations are widely employed in the treatment of hypertensive people; those whose blood pressure does not respond effectively to monotherapy of hydrochlorothiazide and also for the treatment of edema (excess fluid in the body) caused by illness such as heart failure, liver problems, and renal disease. It has been convincingly demonstrated that the combination of any two antihypertensive medications belonging to different groups of the same category, significantly lowers blood pressure, in comparison with the effect produced by increasing the dose of a single medicament. Among the various analytical techniques employed for the estimation of Hydrochlorothiazide, the review portrays that hyphenated technique, in specific liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy was widely employed. The validation parameters namely linearity, LOD, LOQ for individual drug and their combinations, were successfully calibrated. The effectiveness of analytical approaches was evaluated and enhanced for chemical factors. The involvement of green chemistry in the optimized methods for the evaluation of Hydrochlorothiazide for the future development, are suggested.",

In the article, a comparison of the volume method (VM) and orthogonal collocation on finite elements (OCFE) is presented in terms of their reliability, accuracy of calculations, and speed of calculation. The OCFE proved to be more robust than VM. The linear ACM model for the chromatography column has an analytical solution in the form of the equation for the number of theoretical plates (N). This equation is often applied in the interpretation and evaluation of model parameters. However, the versions of N equation published in the literature are not correct. The error can lead to significant imprecision for specific cases. Here, in the paper, the revised equations are presented and discussed for the most frequently used chromatography column models.",

In this study, a simple, isocratic, fast, specific, accurate and precise stability-indicating high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantitative determination of paracetamol (PCM) and potassium sorbate (PS) in oral liquid formulations. The chromatographic separation was achieved on Zorbax SB C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) with Zorbax SB C18 precolumn (12.5 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) using distilled water pH 2 with ortho-phosphoric acid and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) as a mobile phase, and UV detection at 235 nm. The temperature of the column was kept constant at 25 °C. The method was validated according to International Conference on harmonization (ICH) guidelines. The method demonstrated excellent linearity, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996 and 0.9998 for PCM and PS, respectively, over the concentration ranges of 10–600 μg mL −1 (PCM) and 6–500 μg mL −1 (PS). The retention time was found to be 1.98 and 4.86 min for PCM and PS, respectively. Oral liquid formulation samples were subjected to various stress conditions (acidic and alkaline hydrolysis, as well as oxidative, heat and photolytic degradation) for the purpose of forced degradation study. The major degradation of paracetamol was achieved in acidic and basic stress conditions, while thermal and photolytic degradation generally had the least influence. On the other hand, potassium sorbate was highly susceptible to photolytic degradation. It was also shown that the formulation has strong influence on stability of tested compounds. Forced degradation studies demonstrated the stability-indicating power of the method and can be used to assess the stability of paracetamol and potassium sorbate in oral liquid formulations.",

A simple, rapid, reliable high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) technique has been developed for simultaneous detection and quantification of garcinol in three endemic Garcinia sp. of Assam, India. While G. mangostana and G. indica have garnered extensive recognition, these lesser-known species have not received proportionate level of scientific exploration, therefore has served as the subject of investigation. Chromatographic separation was achieved using pre-coated silica gel 60 F 254 plates. The optimized mobile phase (Toluene-Ethyl acetate-Formic acid, 5:4:1 V/V ) at 276 nm produced well-defined and sharp peaks of garcinol, maintaining a constant R F value of 0.75. The regression equation demonstrated a linear relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0.9955. The method was validated in accordance with International Conference of Harmonization guidelines (ICH), encompassing assessments for precision, accuracy, repeatability and robustness, all of which yielded low percentage of relative standard deviation values, attesting to its excellent performance. The content of garcinol found in the extracts were in the range of 0.58–0.98 % w/w . In secondary metabolite analysis, significant amount of phenols (26.06 ± 1.65–57.51 ± 2.62 gallic acid equivalent mg g −1 ), flavonoids (11.27 ± 1.06–21.09 ± 1.34 quercetin equivalent mg g −1 ) and ascorbic acid (3.56 ± 0.12–3.65 ± 0.11 mg/10 g) contents were detected in the extracts. Further, the extracts exhibited good anti-radical activity, which may be attributed to the presence of important secondary metabolites. Therefore, this research establishes the three endemic Garcinia sp. as promising source of garcinol. Additionally, the developed method can be applied for routine quality control analysis of herbal formulations containing garcinol.",

Dissipation followed the first-order kinetics with half-life value ranged in between 1.79–1.84 (pyriproxyfen) and 2.27–2.31 days (fenpropathrin) at the respective doses. The pre-harvest interval of 12 days was recommended for safe consumption of okra fruit. Even though all the decontamination treatments were successful in lowering the residues of both chemicals to substantial levels, washing followed by boiling was found to be the most effective treatment for reducing the residues. The risk quotient values were less than 0.01, implying that pyriproxyfen and fenpropathrin offer no dietary risk to consumers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Formaldehyde plays a significant role in the global economy due to its unique chemical properties and widespread use in both the medical field and various industrial sectors. However, formaldehyde (HCHO) is classified as a persistent organic pollutant and is known to be harmful. Exposure to formaldehyde, both direct and prolonged, can cause severe health issues and potentially lead to death. It is recognized as a human carcinogen by numerous organizations and can negatively impact the endocrine system, as well as having mutagenic or teratogenic effects. Formaldehyde has been detected in various matrices at levels exceeding those permitted by international health regulatory bodies. Chromatography, particularly high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with detection methods, is an analytical technique frequently used to determine volatile organic molecules, including formaldehyde. This investigation aimed to develop and validate an assay method to identify and quantify formaldehyde in cosmetic products using HPLC-PDA. The chosen isocratic system consisted of a ZORBAX RX-C8 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm; 5 μm) and a mobile phase mixture of acetonitrile and water in a 55:45 (v/v) ratio, with a flow rate of 1.5 mL min −1 . Formaldehyde was detected at 353 nm after derivatization with a 0.1N 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine solution, with a retention time of approximately 5.0 min and a total run time of 7.0 min for formaldehyde. The method was validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines. The validation parameters demonstrated high selectivity, precision (RSD &lt;2%), accuracy (mean recovery of 101.3%), linearity ( r &gt; 0.995 in the 1,000–2,400 ppm range), and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.1 ppm. The validated analytical method was applied to 35 cosmetic products. None of these products were labeled as containing formaldehyde, although 6 imported products were labeled as containing formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. The results indicated that 88.6% of the samples tested positive for formaldehyde, with free formaldehyde levels ranging from 20 to 981 ppm. All samples contained formaldehyde levels below the 2000 ppm threshold.",

Application of the HPLC-UV method to six vegetable oils demonstrated inherent vitamin D content and its enhancement under different radiation conditions. Oils were exposed to direct sunlight, UVA, and UVB radiation, with UVB showing the most significant impact on vitamin D levels. Notably, UVB exposure increased vitamin D 3 in castor oil from 2.82 μg mL −1 to 4.29 μg mL −1 and vitamin D 2 in mustard oil from 0.73 μg mL −1 to 1.89 μg mL −1 . The findings highlight the potential of UVB radiation to convert vitamin D precursors to active forms more effectively than other radiation sources. This study provides a novel approach for naturally enriching vitamin D in vegetable oils, offering a promising strategy to mitigate vitamin D deficiencies in populations with limited sun exposure or dietary restrictions. The developed HPLC-UV method and resultant insights into the radiation-induced enhancement of vitamin D content in oils contribute valuable knowledge to nutritional science.",

Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) is known for its efficiency but traditionally relies on toxic solvents. Integrating Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) principles aims to address environmental concerns while maintaining analytical performance. This work aims to advance and authenticate a green, efficient UPLC method for the concurrent quantification of Metformin (MET) and Empagliflozin (EPI) in tablet formulations, adhering to green chemistry principles and ensuring high analytical accuracy. The method was optimized using a UPLC-PDA system with a phenyl column and a mobile phase of ethanol and perchloric acid. Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) was employed to optimize critical method parameters. Environmental impact was assessed using metrics such as GAPI, AMGS, and AGREE. Degradation studies under various stress conditions were performed to test method robustness. The method achieved high recovery rates for MET and EPI, with minimal interference from excipients. The environmental evaluation showed a high Analytical Eco-Score (AES) of 97, indicating low environmental impact. The AGREE score of 0.89 confirmed excellent alignment with green chemistry principles. Degradation studies confirmed the method's stability and reliability under stress conditions. The developed UPLC method demonstrates a significant advancement in analytical sustainability, offering an eco-friendly, efficient, and precise approach to drug analysis. The method's high alignment with green chemistry principles and its effectiveness in quantifying MET and EPI highlight its potential as a model for sustainable analytical practices in pharmaceutical analysis.",

This study assesses dietary aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure in Vietnam using Margin of Exposure (MOE) and Hazard Index (HI) to evaluate risk levels in peanuts, chili powder, corn, and raisins. AFB1 levels were quantified by UPLC-FLD. AFB1 was detected in 71.5% of chili powder, 29.3% of peanuts, and 26.0% of corn samples, with no detectable levels in raisins. Peanuts and corn kernels were classified as high-risk, with MOE values below 10,000 (peanuts: 25.8–56.6; corn: 42.3–92.6) and HI values exceeding 1, potentially contributing to 20.4–44.7 and 12.5–27.3 liver cancer cases per 100,000 adults, respectively. In contrast, chili powder had MOE values between 3,208 and 7,021 and HI below 1, indicating a low public health risk. Raisins were deemed safe with MOE over 200,000 and HI at 0.01.

    "abstract": "Abstract Apples are among the most common fruits, produced on the territory of North Macedonia. Before they reach the market, it is essential to be tested for pesticide residues, which are used for protection against pests for this culture, and in order to ensure the customer safety. For this reason, a novel and simple method for simultaneous determination of captan, folpet, difenoconazole and chlorpyrifos in apple samples has been developed and validated. Acetone is used for extraction of the pesticide residues, followed by liquid-liquid (LLE) and solid–phase extraction (SPE). Separation and quantification of analytes is achieved on reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with UV diode array detector (UV-DAD). The best results are obtained using analytical column LiChrospher 60 RP-select B (250 mm × 4 mm, 5 µm), with isocratic elution and acetonitrile/0.1 % acetic acid in water (70:30, V/V ) as a mobile phase. The flow rate is 1 mL min −1 , and UV detection is performed at 220 and 230 nm. The linearity of the method is tested in the range of 1.50–3.60 mg kg −1 for captan and folpet, and 0.35 – 0.60 mg kg −1 for difenoconazole and chlorpyrifos. The obtained values for recovery and RSD ranged from 94.94 to 114.63 %, and 0.09–9.25 %, respectively. The validated method is successfully applied to apple samples for the determination of the investigated pesticide residues.",

In this review we discuss the basic adsorption models used in chiral separations, and their extension to specific cases. We also outline combination of adsorption models with models describing mass-transport processes in a chromatographic column.

Average recoveries of these three compounds from spiked pig's liver ranged from 63.8 to 88.1% and relative standard deviations were between 5.0 and 9.7%. These results indicate the method is highly sensitive, simple, inexpensive, and results in good purification. It could also meet requirements for analysis of pig's urine in domestic and import/export inspection work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper is aimed at developing a gradient elution reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for the separation of a complex mixture composed of ivabradine and its eleven impurities, in a reasonable timeframe. In order to obtain a robust and reliable HPLC method for separation of this mixture, Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) was applied. This approach demonstrated to be useful in development of a long lasting life cycle methods. Four chromatographic variables were defined as key method parameters (KMPs) and optimized towards the analytical target profile (ATP). Designated KMPs were initial and final amount of acetonitrile in the mobile phase, pH value of the aqueous phase and gradient time, while resolutions of critical peak pairs were denoted as critical method attributes (CMAs). Relationships between KMPs and CMAs were obtained with the aid of Design of Experiments (DoEs) methodology among which Box-Behnken design (BBD) was employed to gain valid mathematical models. Obtained mathematical equations were used to construct the Design Space (DS) and select reliable optimal separation conditions. They included 11% (v/v) and 34% (v/v) of initial and final amount of acetonitrile, respectively, as well as 45 min of gradient elution time and 20 mM ammonium acetate as aqueous mobile phase with pH set to 7.35. The possibility to separate the diastereoisomers of impurity X was also evaluated. It was demonstrated that this separation could not be achieved in gradient elution mode within the defined variable domains and in a reasonable time span. The developed method was validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) guideline and met all the required criteria.",

Four impurities are stated in the British Pharmacopoeia among which are sulfanilamide and dapsone. This work presents two specific, accurate and precise chromatographic methods for the simultaneous determination of a mixture of sulfacetamide sodium, sulfanilamide and dapsone. The first method is an isocratic RP-HPLC where the separation of components was achieved on C18 column. A green mobile phase was used consisting of methanol:water (60:40, v/v). The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min and effluent was monitored at 273 nm. The second method is a TLC-spectrodensitometric one where good separation was achieved by using silica plates and a mobile phase consisting of chloroform:dichloromethane:acetic acid (6:2.5:1.5, by volume). Determination was done by densitometry in the absorbance mode at 273 nm. Both methods were validated in compliance with ICH guidelines. They were also successfully applied for the determination of sulfacetamide sodium and its impurities in Ocusol® ophthalmic solutions. The obtained results were statistically compared to the results obtained by applying the official methods of analysis of each component where no significant difference was found with respect to accuracy and precision.",

A simple and inexpensive TLC image-analysis method for quantification of the piperine content of the traditional medicinal preparations of Bhutan has been established in this study. An image of the TLC chromatogram, under UV light at 254 nm, was taken by use of a digital camera and was further transformed to a density profile plot, along the direction of development, by use of Scion Image software. The concentration of piperine was calculated by comparing its peak area with a calibration plot established by chromatography of piperine standards on the same TLC plate. Linear regression analysis of the calibration data revealed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9962) between response and amount of piperine in the range 0.34–1.03 μg per spot. The specificity, precision, accuracy, and recovery of the method are satisfactory. The analytical results obtained by use of the method were not significantly different from those obtained by use of densitometric TLC. A disadvantage of the method is its low sensitivity — the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 15.36 and 46.54 ng per spot, respectively.",

The retention times and peak shapes predicted by use of the model were in good mutual agreement for a wide range of concentrations for all the analytes investigated.",

The best separation was achieved on a 250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5-μm particle, RP C18 column with 70:30 (υ/υ) methanol-0.01 m sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1. UV detection was at 244 nm. Response was a linear function of concentration over the range 0.05–20 μg mL−1 (r = 0.9998) and the limits of detection and quantitation were 3.7 and 11.3 ng mL−1, respectively. The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The drug was subjected to oxidative, hydrolytic, photolytic, and thermal stress. Degradation products produced as a result of this stress did not interfere with detection of buspirone and the assay can thus be regarded as stability-indicating. The method was used for quantification of buspirone in commercial buspirone tablets and to check content uniformity. The excipients present in the formulation did not interfere with the assay. The method is suitable for application in quality-control laboratories, because it is simple and rapid with good accuracy and precision.",

Four data sets characterize antioxidant properties, one data set characterizes antibacterial property, and one data set characterizes anticancer activity. Antioxidant properties were measured with two free radical standards (DPPH and ABTS), two free radical scavenger standards (trolox and gallic acid), and three analytical techniques (EPR spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible [UV–vis] spectrophotometry, and the dot blot test with bioautographic detection). Antibacterial activity was tested upon the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) strain, and anticancer activity was evaluated upon the human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT116). It was found out that the thyme extracts characterize with all three biological activities (yet with anticancer activity not very strongly pronounced) and that in quantitative terms, each activity strongly depends on the thyme species considered. An ultimate goal of this study was to investigate if any quantitatively confirmed correlation exists among these three biological activities, which might point out to a common mechanism of their action. To this effect, six sets of numerical data underwent hierarchical clustering and Principal Component Analysis. Based on the results obtained, no quantitative correlation was established among antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticancer activity of the thyme species, which seems indicative of different molecular mechanisms of these three actions.",

The adopted enantioseparation conditions were the same ones, as employed earlier for a successful enantioseparation of l- and d-proline. To this effect, we used microcrystalline cellulose as stationary phase and a quaternary mixture composed of 2-butanol:pyridine:glacial acetic acid:water (30:20:4:24, v/v) as mobile phase. Structural difference between proline and hydroxyproline consists in the presence of one hydroxyl group per molecule of the latter amino acid, which makes the respective enantioseparation a more difficult task. Consequently, the obtained separation effect was not a complete (i.e., a baseline) resolution of the two Hyp antimers yet a sufficient enough proof of the appearance of d-Hyp, apparently due to spontaneous chiral conversion taking place in the course of the l-Hyp solution storage and ageing period. The condensation products were discovered both in the fresh and the aged l-Hyp solution, yet in the aged sample, the condensation product yields were considerably higher than in the freshly prepared one (as convincingly demonstrated by mass spectrometry). Demonstration of the condensation products was performed with the aid of thin-layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and thin-layer chromatography-mass spectrometry (TLC-MS).",

Determination of urinary 8-OHdG is challenging due to its low level within a complex matrix. In this study, a new approach of solid/liquid phase microextraction technique prior to high-performance liquid chromatography diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) analysis was developed for the determination of trace levels of 8-OHdG in urine samples. The solid/liquid phase microextraction device was constructed by reinforcement of multi-walled carbon nanotubes into the pores of a short segment 2.5 cm of hollow fiber microtube with two ends heat sealed. Based on the optimized procedure, the selected analyte was extracted from an acidic sample solution (10 mL adjusted at pH = 5) into the five extraction devices. After the extraction period (30 min), the 8-OHdG was eluted from the extraction device using methanol (350 µL) under ultrasonication for 5 min. The analytical performance of the method in synthetic urine samples showed good linearity ( R 2 &gt; 0.999) with the limits of detection of 0.85 ng mL −1 , and extraction recovery &gt; 92.36%. The developed microextraction technique exhibited a confident sensitivity, feasible operation, and simplicity in comparison with other published methods and was valid to determinate trace 8-OHdG in urine cancer patients' samples by using a cheap and commonly available HPLC-DAD instrument.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY We have previously revealed, for the first time, the tendency of some profens (S-(+)-ibuprofen, S-(+)-naproxen, and S,R-(±)-2-phenylpropionic acid) to undergo oscillatory transenantiomerization when dissolved in some low-molecular-weight solvents. Such oscillatory reactions, which are relatively rare among chemical reactions, can be stimulated by several different physical and chemical conditions. It was the objective of this study to reveal the reason for the oscillatory transenantiomerization of profens. The analytical techniques used in our study embraced measurement of the viscosity of the profen solutions and acquiring their HPLC chromatograms and 1 H NMR spectra. It has been firmly established that the physical property leading to oscillatory transenantiomerization of the profens is their ability to act as low-molecular-weight gelators, which results in substantial differences between the viscosity of their solutions and that of the pure solvents. One well-known cause of oscillatory reactions is diffusion-driven instability which appears in the form of oscillations. This occurs when, because of high solution viscosity, the rate of diffusion of an intermediate reaction product becomes less its rate of formation. For the profens investigated it seems most likely that their ability to substantially increase the viscosity of the solution results in the rate of diffusion of an intermediate keto–enol product being lower than its rate of formation from the respective profen enantiomer.",

Seeds of the tatarian maple (Acer tataricum L.) a widespread member of the natural Romanian flora, were analysed in a search for a new, convenient source of gamma-linolenic acid. Physicochemical study of the fatty oil obtained from the seeds established the fatty oil seed content (gravimetric method), refractive index, relative density, acidity, iodine and saponification values (official methods), and the fatty acid and phytosterol profiles (GC–MS). Tatarian maple seeds were found to contain an important amount of fatty oil (14.28–15.50%) with a high level of unsaturated fatty acids (93.89%). The essential fatty acids identified in this oil were linoleic (34.87%), gamma-linolenic (6.01%), and alpha-linolenic acids (1.04%). Stigmasterol (1.65%), beta-sitosterol (1.15%), and squalene (0.20%) were also identified. Because the not very large amount of gamma-linolenic acid in the seed oil is balanced by the natural abundance of the plant, the seeds of Acer tataricum could be regarded as a new convenient alternative source of this rare and valuable compound.",

A new, simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method coupled with fluorescence detector was developed and validated to quantify IRT and its active metabolite SN38 in the plasma of non-obese diabetic/severe combined immune-deficient mice (NOD/SCID) mice bearing colon tumor. The plasma samples were extracted by precipitation method using acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The chromatographic separation was achieved using mobile phase consisted of water and acetonitrile (57:43 v/v) pH 3 at the flow rate of 0.8 mL/min in C18 column (internal diameter, 250 × 4.6 mm; pore size, 5 μm). The method was validated according to the bioanalytical guidelines defined by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicine Agency (EMA). A regression ( R 2) value of 0.999 and 0.997 for IRT and SN38 suggested the good linearity in the range of 0.1–10 μg/mL and 5–500 ng/mL, respectively. The calculated lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) for IRT were 0.1 and 0.065 μg/mL, respectively. However, for SN38, LLOQ and LOD were 5 and 2 ng/mL, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day variations (coefficient of variance; % CV) observed during the validation were found to be within the set limit of 15%. Both accuracy and percentage recovery analyzed and calculated from the quality control samples were in the between the defined range of 85–115%. Plasma samples were found to be stable when stored at room temperature for 2 h, after 2 freeze–thaw cycles and at −80 °C for 2 months. The developed method was successfully applied to study the plasma elimination profile of IRT in NOD/SCID mice with tumor.

    "abstract": "SimiaoYong'an decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine formula consisting of four herbs, has been widely used for the treatment of gangrene disease. However, its clinical application is restricted due to the lack of an effective quality control method that covers the main active compounds in the formula. In this study, a high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC–DAD) method was established for the simultaneous determination of 13 active compounds including harpagide, neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, isochlorogenic acid B, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid C, angoroside C, harpagoside, cinnamic acid, glycyrrhizic acid, and ligustilide. Separation of these compounds was achieved using a Kromasil 100-5-C 18 column with a gradient elution program consisting of acetonitrile and 0.4% phosphoric acid solution. The specificity, linearity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy tests were implemented to validate the method. The validated method was successfully applied for determination of 13 components from several finished batches of SimiaoYong'an decoction. The results demonstrated that the established method was accurate, reliable, and could be used as a suitable quality control method for the quantification of SimiaoYong'an decoction.",

Efficient extraction and rapid liquid chromatography methods are essentially required for qualitative and quantitative determination of xanthones in their natural sources. In the present investigation, fruit rinds extracts of 8 Garcinia species from India, were prepared with solvents of varying polarity. Identification and quantification of 3 xanthones, namely, α-mangostin, β-mangostin, and γ-mangostin in these extracts were carried out using a rapid and validated ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–photodiode array detection (UHPLC–PDA) method at 254 nm. γ-Mangostin (3.97 ± 0.05 min) was first eluted, and it was followed by α-mangostin (4.68 ± 0.03 min) and β-mangostin (5.60 ± 0.04 min). The calibration curve for α-mangostin, β-mangostin, and γ- mangostin was linear in the concentration range 0.781–100 μg/mL. α-Mangostin was quantified in all 4 extracts of Garcinia mangostana .

However, the content of α-mangostin was below the limit of detection or limit of quantification in the extracts of other Garcinia species. Similarly, β-mangostin was quantified only in hexane (1.17 ± 0.01%), chloroform (0.39 ± 0.07%), and ethyl acetate (0.28 ± 0.03%) extracts of G. mangostana . γ-Mangostin was quantified in all 4 extracts of G. mangostana .

Their positive charge poses difficulties in their chromatographic analysis, resulting in the publication of different approaches for each K-oxime. A multiplexed method is presented for the rapid quantitation of 10 K-oximes in blood with its utility demonstrated in vivo . Liquid chromatography with absorbance detection was employed. Reversed-phase separation was achieved on a highly nonpolar stationary phase. Method validation was based on the respective guideline of the European Medicines Agency. Times to peak concentrations and 120-min areas under the time–concentration curves were determined in rats following intraperitoneal administration. Adequate retention and separation of K-oximes with acceptable peak shapes in short isocratic runs was achieved by adjusting ionic strength, organic content and the concentration of the ion-pairing agent of the mobile phase. Chromatographic properties were governed by optimizing the concentration of dissolved ions. Accurate adjustment of the organic content was indispensable for avoiding peak drifting and splitting. Dose-adjusted exposure to K-347 and K-868 was exceptionally low, while exposure to K-48 was the highest. The method is suitable for screening systemic exposure to various K-oximes and can be extended.",

Additionally, several places of the spot (start, middle, end) can be measured and also correlated. In the current paper we perform a simulation done on 170 real spectra with different levels of contamination and noise, establishing the distribution of correlation coefficient. It can be concluded that contamination up to 10% almost cannot be detected by simple correlation measurement, regardless of the noise level. Moreover, at a high noise level there is a very low margin between correlation of different compounds and the correlation of the same (but noisy) spectra. These observations suggest that the spectral correlation cannot be a reliable measure of method specificity and some another chemometric methods need to be searched in further research.",

The solvent system consisted of methanol-water-triethylamine (8:2:0.05 v/v). The system was found to give compact spot for sitagliptin phosphate (Rf value of 0.55 ± 0.03). Densitometric analysis of sitagliptin phosphate was carried out in the absorbance mode at 267 nm. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r2 = 0.998±0.0015 with respect to peak area in the concentration range 1000–6000 ng per spot. The mean value ± SD of slope and intercept was 0.723 ± 0.043 and 17.24 ± 18.78 with respect to peak area. The method was validated for precision, recovery, and robustness. The limits of detection and quantification were 85.80 and 265.42 ng per spot, respectively. Sitagliptin phosphate was subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation, and photo and thermal degradation. The drug undergoes degradation under acidic, basic, and oxidative conditions. This indicates that the drug is susceptible to acid and base, and oxidation. The degraded product was well resolved from the pure drug with significantly different RF value. Statistical analysis proves that the method is repeatable, selective, and accurate for the estimation of investigated drug.

Optimum separations were obtained with a Zorbax SB-C18 column by gradient elution with acetonitrile-water as the mobile phase. The drift tube temperature of ELSD was set at 105 °C, and the nebulizing gas flow rate was 2.5 L min−1.

The calibration curves were rectilinear over the concentration ranges of 0.05–1.0, 0.07–4.0, and 1.0–10.0 μg/mL for cetirizine dihydrochloride, psudoephedrine hydrochloride, and paracetamol respectively; with detection limits of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.08 μg/mL, and quantification limits of 0.04, 0.09, and 1.02 μg/mL, respectively. The results obtained were in good agreement with those obtained by the comparison method. Furthermore, the method was applied for the determination of the drugs in spiked human plasma and used to reveal the pharmacokinetic characters in a healthy volunteer treated with oral administration of the studied two combined dosage forms of cetirizine.",

The method was developed on TLC aluminium plates precoated with silica gel F254 using solvent system izopropanol:n-hexane:ammonia 25% (8:12:3, v/v/v), which gives compact spots for azithromycin (RF = 0.65), clarithromycin (RF = 0.54), roxithromycin (RF = 0.49), spiramycin (RF = 0.22), and troleandomycin (RF = 0.36). Densitometric analysis was carried out at 478 nm after spraying with (1:4, v/v) sulphuric acid:ethanol and heating at 100°C for 5 min. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with correlation coefficient higher than 0.99. The method is distinguished by high sensitivity, with limit of detection (LOD) from 0.34 μg/spot for troleandomycin to 0.67 μg/spot for clarithromycin and limit of quantification (LOQ) from 1.02 μg/spot for troleandomycin to 2.04 μg/spot for clarithromycin and a wide linearity range from 2 to 12 μg/spot for spiramycin and 2–15 μg/spot for other antibiotics. The precision of the determination was good; relative standard deviation (RSD) varied in the range from 1.49% to 4.14%.",

The methanol extracts of leaves, its formulation, and standard solution of trigonelline were applied on silica gel F254 HPTLC plates and developed in a twin chamber using the mobile phase toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid-methanol (2:3:1.8:3.8, υ/υ/υ/υ).

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used in many countries for thousands of years and played an indispensable role in the prevention and treatment of diseases, especially the complicated and chronic ones. However, the application of TCM in diseases is still not fully recognized by people around the world, the main reason is that Chinese herb is a very complex mixture containing hundreds of different components. Thus, it is essential to make quality control and evaluation of TCM. A new quality evaluation method, quantitative analysis of multi-components by single marker (QAMS), was developed to the quality control of alkaloids in TCM, a case study on Radix aconiti lateralis, named Fuzi in Chinese. Six alkaloids, including aconitine, hypaconitine, mesaconitine, benzoylaconine, benzoylmesaconine, and benzoylhypaconine, were selected as main components to evaluate the quality of Radix aconiti lateralis. The feasibility and accuracy of QAMS were checked by the external standard method, and various high-performance liquid chromatographic instruments and chromatographic conditions were investigated to verify its applicability. Using aconitine as the internal reference substance and the content of aconitine was calculated according to relative correction factors by high-performance liquid chromatography. The present results showed that there was no significant difference observed between the QAMS method and the external standard method with the relative average deviations less than 3.0%, and QAMS is an effective way to control the quality of herbal medicines and seems to be a convenient and accurate approach to analyze multi-composition when reference substances are unavailable.",

Characteristic leading (i.e. frontally tailing) peaks are obtained and retention depends on the concentration of solutes. It was recently shown that this order could be reversed. In vacant ion exclusion chromatography (vIEC) sample flows as mobile phase and pure water is injected as the sample. Symmetrical peaks are obtained; this is believed to be because of self-buffering of the solutes in the sample. The aim of the work discussed in this paper was to describe the mechanism of retention in IEC and vIEC by using the modified equilibrium–dispersive (ED) model. It was found that the retention times and peak shapes predicted by the derived equations are in good agreement with experimental data. These equations also predict new features of vIEC, and these were confirmed experimentally. It was shown that in vIEC, in contrast with IEC, symmetrical peaks are obtained even for a single analyte.",

There is substantial evidence that lignan constituents are mainly responsible for the beneficial effects of this plant medicine. The amounts of the major bioactive lignans in this plant vary widely with species, habitat, and the collecting time, and as such, establishment of an HPLC fingerprint for quality control of this herbal medicine is of particular importance. To achieve this, ten batches of Fructus schisandrae chinensis were collected from Tieli, in China, and their chemical components were analyzed under optimized HPLC conditions. On the basis of the chromatographic data, a consistent HPLC fingerprint pattern containing 20 common peaks was obtained. Among these common peaks, six were identified as schizandrin, schizandrol B, schisantherin, deoxyschiandrin, γ-schizandrin B, and schizandrin C. On the basis of this HPLC fingerprint and principal-components analysis, the quality of fifteen samples from different producing areas of China was objectively assessed, and the species difference between Fructus schisandrae sphenantherae and Fructus schisandrae chinensis was clearly differentiated. To summarize, the data described in this study offer valuable information for quality control and proper use of Fructus schisandrae chinensis.",

Our objective was to develop a new, rapid and simple solid-phase extraction method without protein precipitation followed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for analysis of ciprofloxacin in low- and high-fat milk. The HPLC-MS method (a single-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source was used as detector) was validated using a quinolone derivative, aripiprazole, as internal standard. A C8 column and gradient elution with 0.02 m ammonium acetate solution (pH 2.5) and acetonitrile mixtures (flow rate 0.5 mL min−1) were used for HPLC separation. Various modes of detection (diode-array detection and MS detection in scanning and selected-ion monitoring modes) were compared for selectivity and sensitivity of quantitative analysis of ciprofloxacin. Use of selected- ion monitoring resulted in a 1600:1 signal-to-noise ratio which can be successfully applied to milk matrices resulting in a lower limit of detection of 0.4 ng mL−1 and a lower limit of quantification of 4.0 ng mL−1. Recovery was 99.06 ± 0.15 and 98.57 ± 0.14% for low- and high-fat milk, respectively. The method enables analysis of the free, biologically available, amount of ciprofloxacin in in vitro simulation of milk-ciprofloxacin interaction studies.",

After addition of atractylenolide III as an internal standard (IS), protein precipitation by acetonitrile was used to prepare samples. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase with gradient elution. An electrospray ionization source was applied and operated in positive ion mode; multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode was used for quantification using target fragment ions m/z 231.1 → 185.1 for atractylenolide I, m/z 233.1 → 91.0 for II, and m/z 249.0 → 231.1 for IS. Calibration plots were linear throughout the range 1–1000 ng/mL for atractylenolide I and II in rat plasma. Mean recoveries of atractylenolide I and II in rat plasma ranged from 86.2% to 96.3%. Relative standard deviation (RSD) of intra-day and inter-day precision was both less than 12%. The accuracy of the method was between 91.0% and 109.0%. The method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic study of atractylenolide I and II after intravenous administration in rats.",

The cereal samples were extracted with acetonitrile, cleaned up, and concentrated by green extractant menthol via γ-cyclodextrin assisted extraction process. The extractant menthol dispersed as fine droplets in the cyclodextrin solution and then solidified at room temperature for efficient extraction and convenient collection. The optimized method provided good linearity in the range of 0.01–10 mg kg −1 with limits of detection of 3.5–9.5 μg kg −1 . The fortified recoveries of three pyrethroids (i.e., lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and bifenthrin) in four cereals ( i.e. , rice, wheat, maize, and millet) at three levels were in the range of 77.6–101.6% with relative standard deviations of 0.6–6.6%. Overall, the proposed method can be successfully applied for the determination of pyrethroids in cereals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ziprasidone is the second generation antipsychotic drug with unique multipotent G-protein-coupled (GPCR) receptor binding profile. Since ziprasidone is a highly lipophilic and unstable compound, development of efficient method for a concurrent assay of ziprasidone and its main impurities was a very challenging task. The UHPLC-MS/MS method that we developed for simultaneous determination of ziprasidone and its main impurities (BITP, Chloroethyl-chloroindolinone, Zip-oxide, Zip-dimer, and Zip-BIT) was compared with some other related HPLC-UV methods of our own and other authorship. An increase of the mobile phase pH value from 2.5 to 4.7 units in the examined analytical methods influenced elution order of the investigated compounds. It was found out that the UHPLC-MS/MS method is more selective and sensitive than the earlier developed HPLC-UV method. Similar to our earlier HPLC-UV method, the UHPLC-MS/MS method is linear with a correlation coefficient ( r ) above 0.99 for all the analysed compounds, but with a negligibly lower precision and accuracy. Finally, with shorter analysis time, smaller column size and reduction of solvent consumption, UHPLC-MS/MS is assumed as a greener method than HPLC-UV for the ziprasidone purity assay. After transfer of the UHPLC-MS/MS method to the UHPLC-DAD system, suitability of the UHPLC-DAD method for routine control of ziprasidone and its main impurities is examined and confirmed based on the retained good selectivity, resolution and short analysis time.",

For some systems we observed a minimum on the plot of I against Tc. This minimum was not only observed, it was also computationally confirmed by use of the equation I = A + B/Tc + ClnTc, where A, B, and C are terms of the equation with physicochemical significance [2,4–6]. On the basis of this equation we were also able to evaluate two thermodynamic magnitudes, the activation enthalpy, ∆H, and the chemical potential of the partitioning of one methylene group between the two phases of the chromatographic system, ∆μp(CH2), for all the analytes investigated.",

This is mainly achieved by investigating the correlation between RF values or scoring the distances between the spots. This paper presents and discusses another approach, based on the distances to the closest spot and to the top or bottom of the plate. The theory arises from a well-known geometrical problem about equal-spreading of the points inside a unit square. Two coefficients are proposed — sensitive and insensitive to complete separation, which are the two-dimensional version of previously proposed RU and RD criteria (retention uniformity and retention distance, describing the equal-spreading of the spots in one-dimensional chromatography). They are included in the range 0–1 and their distribution as a random variable is well defined and not affected by the number of separated compounds.",

    "abstract": "Ixeris dentata (Thunb. ex Thunb.) Nakai (Asteraceae), a well-known edible vegetable in Asia, contains various bioactive secondary metabolites, including sesquiterpene lactones. In this study, a high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for simultaneous determination of seven sesquiterpene lactone glucosides isolated from the roots of I. dentata . In addition, these compounds were evaluated in terms of their antiviral activities against coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and human enterovirus 71 (EV71). The developed method was validated in terms of linearity ( R 2 &gt; 0.9996), precision (RSD &lt; 2.24%), accuracy (96.30–102.77%), and stability (RSD &lt; 1.94%) and successfully applied to the quantitation of the I. dentata root samples collected from six different regions of Korea. The content of sesquiterpene lactone glucosides varied significantly based on the region. For the antiviral activities, guaianolides with an ester group at C-8 (compounds 6 and 7 ) showed the most potent activities against CBV3, while germacranolide (compound 5 ) showed the most consistent antiviral activity against both CVB3 and EV71. The method was validated to be simple and reliable to simultaneously determine seven putative bioactive sesquiterpene lactone glucosides, the substantial chemotaxonomic markers, in I. dentata root samples.",

Method Liquid–liquid extraction of both drugs and internal standard from plasma into ethyl acetate was used for sample preparation and analysis. Separation of both drugs and internal standard was achieved on an Inertsil ODS-3 (4.6 mm × 50 cm, dp 5 μm, particle size) column using an isocratic mobile phase of acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium formate adjusted to pH 8 with 50 μL ammonium hydroxide in composition of 73:27 ( v / v ) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. The LC–MS/MS was operated under the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) using an electrospray ionization technique. Mass parameters were optimized to monitor transitions at m / z [M + H] + 389.0 → 200.8 for levocetirizine dihydrochloride, m / z [M + H] + 586.2 → 422.2 for montelukast sodium, and m / z [M + H] + 502.2 → 466.0 for fexofenadine hydrochloride. Results The method was found to be linear in the range of 1–500 ng/mL for both drugs. The intra-day and inter-day precision were in the range of 0.96–1.92% and 1.03–1.55%, respectively. Matrix effect was acceptable with %RSD &lt; 15. Conclusion The proposed method was validated and successfully applied for a pharmacokinetic study of both drugs in human plasma after oral administration of their pharmaceutical preparation.",

Drugs of the first mixture are used to manage gastrointestinal tract illness that are common during early stages of pregnancy, while pharmaceutical agents of the second mixture are administered over the counter as galactagogues or to overcome postpartum depression. Mixture I includes famotidine (FMT), ranitidine (RNT), nizatidine (NZT), and pantoprazole (PNT), which were separated on a C18 column using a mobile phase composed of methanol: 0.02 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate (60:40, v/v ) of pH 6.9, adopting UV detection at 240 nm at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Mixture II on the other hand, consists of domperidone (DOM), metoclopramide (MET), and sulpiride (SUL). These drugs were eluted using the same column and flow rate as those in mixture I, using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile: 0.075 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate (30:70, v/v ) of pH 6 adopting a detection wavelength 270 nm. Two optimization protocols were utilized to optimize the chromatographic separation conditions, namely one factor at a time (OFAT) and design of experiments (DOE) where face centered cube response surface experimental design was chosen for this investigation. Comparison of the results obtained from both protocols reveals the accordance between them. Full validation procedure under guidance of United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) was applied to the proposed methods which enabled their application to separate the drugs of both mixtures in spiked rat whole blood samples and in vivo analysis of rat heart blood.",

    "abstract": "Summary A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed for enantioresolution of amino alcohols using an indirect approach. Two sets of chiral derivatizing reagents (CDRs) having amino acids (CDRs 1–4; set A) and their amides (CDRs 5–8; set B) as chiral auxiliaries in cyanuric chloride (CC) moiety were synthesized and characterized. Diastereomers of eight amino alcohols were synthesized, under microwave irradiation, using each of the eight CDRs. The resulting diastereomers were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using C18 column and eluting mixtures of acetonitrile with aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (aq.TFA) in a linear gradient (45 min) with UV detection at 230 nm. The results (in terms of resolution Rs and retention factor k) obtained for the two sets of diastereomers were compared among themselves and among the two groups. The effects of chiral auxiliaries (in terms of acid and amides variants), constituting CDRs, on separation were also evaluated. The elution order for the diastereomers was determined. The separation method was validated for limit of detection (LOD), linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery.",

    "abstract": "Summary Chestnut exhibits anti-inflammatory, styptic, anti-diarrhea, and analgestic effects as a traditional Chinese medicine. There is increasing evidence that shows that the consumption of chestnuts has become more important in human nutrition due to the health benefits provided by the antioxidants. The phenolic compounds are responsible for major bioactivities, such as anti-tumor and anti-oxidation. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with diode array detection (DAD) was established for the simultaneous determination of six phenolic compounds (gallic acid, GA; protocatechuic acid, PR; catechin, CA; epicatechin, EP; quercetin, QU; kaempferol, KA) in Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima blume) kernel. The sample followed by separation on Eclipse XDB-C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, id., 5 μm) with gradient elution of methanol-1.0% acetate acid solution as a mobile phase, at a temperature of 30°C, under the ratio of 1.2 mL min−1, with 5 μL injection volume, and multi-wavelength synthesis was used with DAD. The correlation coefficients were larger than 0.999, the recoveries were 97.58% for GA, 100.41% for PA, 96.23% for CA, 101.38% for QU, 99.15% for EP, and 98.60% for KA, relative standard deviation (RSD) were 1.04% for GA, 1.21% for PA, 1.09% for CA, 1.19% for QU, 1.06% for EP, and 1.20% for KA. This method was applied for the determination of phenolics in chestnut kernel and was found to be fast, sensitive, and suitable.",

For establishing an analysis method for the effective quality control of Zuojin pill extract, the active components of three protoberberine alkaloids (coptisine, palmatine, berberine, components from C. rhizoma) and two indolequinoline alkaloids (evodiamine, rutaecarpine, components from E. fructus) in Zuojin pill extract were determined simultaneously by high-performance liquid chromatography. Chromatographic separations were performed on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm). Elution was carried out at 25°C under isocratic conditions by using 25 mmol L−1 KH2PO4-25 mmol L−1 SDS-acetonitrile (1:1:2, v/v/v, adjusted pH to 3.0 using phosphoric acid) as a mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1.

Simultaneously, our aim was also to identify, separate, and characterize the major degradation product (DPs) of flucloxacillin, generated under various stress conditions. To achieve this objective, flucloxacillin was subjected to hydrolytic, oxidative, photolytic, and thermal stress as per International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines Q1A(R2). The drug was found to degrade in acidic, alkaline, neutral, and oxidative stress conditions and showed stable behavior in photolytic and thermal stress conditions. In total, seven degradation products were formed, which were separated on a C-18 column employing a gradient high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. A complete mass fragmentation pathway of the drug was established with the help of multi-stage (MSn) and mass spectrometry/time of flight (MS/TOF) accurate mass studies. Then the stress samples were subjected to LC-MS/TOF studies, which provided the fragmentation pattern along with the accurate masses for a major degradation product. The entire mass spectral studies helped to identify the degradation product so as to propose its best possible structure. Finally the total information was used to establish the degradation pathway of the drug.",

    "abstract": "Summary Ezetimibe is the first in a new class of antihypercholesterolemic drugs. Since it has not long been available on the market, many of its properties may still be revealed. Analytical methods for its determination are scarce, especially regarding serum samples. A simple, fast, and effective high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) method for the determination of ezetimibe concentration in human serum has therefore been developed. Three mobile phases were analysed, and original modifications to the concentration and flow parameters were made. Of five potential internal standards (IS), only nitrendipine was found to be suitable. The analytical wavelength was chosen based on the absorption spectrum of ezetimibe in the mobile phase. Finally, an extraction analysis was performed using two different solvents, and the extrahent volume was optimised. The final method developed was as follows. Single extraction of 1 mL serum sample, spiked with IS, was performed using 10 mL of methyl-t-butyl ether. Separation was obtained at ambient temperature on a Waters C18 Symmetry Shield (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) column. The isocratic mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and 0.1 M ammonium acetate aqueous solution 55:45 (v/v), set at flow rate of 0.75 mL min−1. Ezetimibe was detected at a wavelength of 232 nm after 5.49 min, and the IS was detected at 8.05 min. The developed method has been validated according to ICH standards. It was found to be specific, precise, accurate and linear over the range 10–800 ng mL−1 with R2 > 0.998, and detection and quantification limits of 4.60 ng mL−1 and 13.94 ng mL−1, respectively. The method has been applied to clinical serum samples. The developed technique allowed for successful in vivo assessment of ezetimibe concentrations in samples obtained from hypercholesterolemia patients who are chronically receiving the drug.",

Characterization of degradation products by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) studies in solution form was done, and the possible mechanism for the formation of degradants is discussed. Fenofibrate was subjected to different hydrolytic stress conditions and thermal stress condition (in solid form). Successful separation of drug from degradants was achieved on a C18 column using water–acetonitrile (25:75 v/v) as the mobile phase. Other high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) parameters were: flow rate, 1 mL min−1; detection wavelength, 286 nm; column temperature, 25 °C; and injection volume, 20 μL. The method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, robustness, and specificity and was stability-indicating one, based on the specificity studies. The drug degraded under acidic, basic, and oxidative hydrolytic stress while it was relatively stable towards neutral hydrolysis and thermal stress. The stressed samples were subjected to LC–MS/MS analysis. On the basis of spectral data, the structures of four degradation products and one interaction product were suggested. Degradation products were characterized to be isopropyl acetate, 2-[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)phenoxy]-2-methyl propanoic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, and benzoic acid. The structure of one interaction product was proposed as methyl 2-[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)phenoxy]-2-methylpropanoate.",

The method employed 60 mM Tris buffer and 50 mM anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution at pH 9.8.

In regions including the United States, Europe, and China, cantharidin is either a banned ingredient or being highly regulated in cosmetic products. In this article, a gas chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (GC-MS/MS) method has been established for the determination of cantharidin in cosmetic products. Cosmetic samples were divided into two groups according to whether they contained aqueous ethanol or not. Samples containing aqueous ethanol in the formulation were dried under an air flow prior to extraction by methanol. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with the parent ion at m/z 128 and the product ions at m/z 55 and 85 was employed. The linear range covered from 0.1 to 30.00 μg mL−1 (R = 0.9996) for cantharidin. The detection limit (LOD) was 0.3 μg kg−1. The intraday and between-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were <8.7%. The mean recoveries were within the range 101.5–110.5%. The developed GC-MS/MS method was applied on 12 commercial cosmetic product samples, and is shown to be simple and sensitive and can be used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of cantharidin in cosmetic products.",

Ma. They are very similar in structure, the only difference being exchange of OH and OCH3 at the 7 and 8 positions. By calculations based on the geometry of the molecules using the MM+ force field, the different distances between the hydroxyl groups of the two xanthones were obtained (4.64774 Å for X2 and 7.19412 Å for X1), therefore, the two hydroxyl groups of X1 should freely interact with more water molecules than those of X2 in aqueous solution. In other words, X2 is more hydrophobic than X1. Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC) was therefore chosen for separation of the compounds. The optimum separation conditions were: 20 mm borate + 20 mm SDS (pH 9.8) as running buffer, 17.5 kV applied potential, and detection wavelength 260 nm. The two xanthones were well separated in 9.0 min, with Gaussian peak shapes. The repeatability of the MEKC method (expressed as RSD) for X1 and X2 was 0.9 and 1.1%, respectively, for migration time, and 3.1 and 1.4% for peak area. The limits of detection (S/N = 3) were 0.41 μg mL−1 for X1 and 0.82 μg mL−1 for X2. The recovery of the MEKC method for the two xanthones was also satisfactory.",

Significant degradation was observed during oxidative stress; minor degradation was observed in acidic stress and no degradation was observed in other stress conditions. The chromatographic method was optimized using the samples generated from forced degradation studies and the spiked impurity solution. The analysis was carried out with a 50 mm length × 4.6 mm i.d., 3.0 μm particle size YMC Pack Pro-C18 column using the mobile phase consisting of a mixture of 1.0% (v/v) triethylamine in water with pH adjusted to 6.30, using orthophosphoric acid, methanol and acetonitrile (7.7:1.3:1.0) pumped at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1 with ultraviolet (UV) detection at 235 nm. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification for the levofloxacin and its process-related impurities were established. The stressed test solutions were assayed against the qualified working standard of levofloxacin and the mass balance in each case was in between 99.1% and 99.9%, indicating that the developed liquid chromatography (LC) method was a stability-indicating technique. Validation of the developed LC method was carried out as per ICH requirements.",

Flavonoids (icarrin, epimedin A, epimedin B, epimedin C, and baohuoside I) and saponins (notoginsenoside R1, ginsenoside Rgl, and ginsenoside Rbl) are considered as the main bioactive compounds of YST. However, there is no report on quality control of TCMs by simultaneous determination of above-mentioned flavonoids and saponins so far. In this work, for the first time, a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-evaporative light-scattering detector (HPLC-DAD-ELSD) method was developed to evaluate the quality of YST through a simultaneous determination of five major active flavonoids and three main saponins. Optimum separations were obtained with a Zorbax SB-C18 column by gradient elution with acetonitrile-water as the mobile phase. The drift tube temperature of ELSD was set at 105 °C, and the nebulizing gas flow rate was 2.5 L min−1. The fully validated method was successfully applied to quantify the eight bioactive components in three lot products. This simple, low-cost, and reliable HPLC-DAD-ELSD method provided a new basis for assessing the quality of traditional Chinese medicinal compound preparations (TCMCPs) consisting of many bioactive components.",

Amounts of salicylamide ranged from 2.67 to 2.89 mg in the five diuretic tablets analyzed, and recoveries from five pain-relief tablets ranged from 104.7 to 107.1%. Within-day precision was 0.743% and 0.863% (n = 6) for analysis of the fifth diuretic and fifth pain-relief tablets, respectively.

The most important processes affecting the properties of the final product are: the coverage of the abrasive materials, mixing, and proper hardening. The quality of abrasive materials strongly depends on their wettability [1]. Ensuring the homogeneity of the mixture of precursors increases the quality of the final product. The effectiveness of the hardening process depends on the temperature programme used. Although determination of the wettability of abrasive materials is relatively simple, controlling the hardening process is much more complicated. The objective of the work discussed in this paper was evaluation of an inverse gas chromatographic (IGC) procedure for determination of the extent of cross-linking of the resins used in abrasive articles. The results showed that IGC is a simple and suitable method for qualitative estimation of the extent of cross-linking in grinding tools and for checking the homogeneity of the precursors of the product.",

In recent years ion chromatography has became a powerful technique for determination of ions, including inorganic and organic anions and cations. In the work discussed in this paper an ion-chromatographic method using ion-exchange columns and direct UV detection for determination of Cr(VI) in water samples has been validated. The analytical performance of Dionex IonPac AS7 and CS5A columns has been compared and method linearity and sensitivity, limit of determination, and limit of quantification calculated from peak area and peak height are given.",

To assess changes in chemical structure caused by the intrusion comparative analysis was performed by GC–MS of pyrolysates obtained at different temperatures – 358, 480, 610, 770, and 980°C. Comparisons were based on the distribution of aromatic compounds, chiefly naphthalene and its methyl derivatives. The trend was for the amount of methyl substitution of the naphthalene rings to decrease with increasing temperature with, moreover, a relative preference for the more stable β substitution position rather than the α position.

The present paper is focused on relevant literature on LC enantioseparation of ( RS )-Ket along with bioassay, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies within the discipline of analytical chemistry. HPLC and Thin layer chromatography (TLC) methods using both direct and indirect approaches are discussed. The methods provide chirality recognition even in the absence of pure enantiomers. Besides, a brief discussion on resolution by crystallization and enzymatic methods is included. The most interesting aspects include establishment of structure and molecular asymmetry of diastereomeric derivatives using LC-MS, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and by drawing conformations in three dimensional views by using certain software. A brief discussion has also been provided on the recovery of native enantiomers by TLC.",

It is necessary to develop a rapid, reliable, selective and sensitive LC–MS/MS assay to determine letrozole in human plasma to evaluate the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions with clinical pharmacokinetic and therapeutic drug monitoring. Separation was carried out on a Kromasil-C 18 column using acetonitrile-water (55: 45, v/v) as mobile phase. Detection was carried out by multiple reaction monitoring on a 3200Qtrap mass spectrometry. The method needed one-step protein precipitation procedure only, and the cycle time was 2.5 min allowing 500–550 samples per day. It was linear within 0.30–50.00 ng/mL for plasma with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.030 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day RSD were 5.51–8.63%, 2.28–9.95% and the RE was 0.18–1.65%. The recovery rates of letrozole and internal standard for plasma were 89.30–98.55%. Letrozole was stable under all the conditions in the study. The method was sensitive enough to quantitate letrozole over a period of 288 h after giving a single oral dose of 2.5 mg–24 Chinese healthy volunteers. The absorption of letrozole was rapid with small individual difference, the tissue distribution of letrozole was more than that in blood, and the clearance was slow.

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, a UPLC-MS/MS method was developed to measure the concentrations of the flavonoids oroxin A, oroxin B, oroxylin A, oroxyloside, chrysin, chrysin 7- O -beta-gentiobioside, and guaijaverin in the blank mouse blood, and the method was then used in the measurement of the pharmacokinetics of the compounds in mice. Oroxin A, oroxin B, oroxylin A, oroxyloside, chrysin, chrysin 7- O -beta-gentiobioside, and guaijaverin were administered intravenously at a dose of 5 mg kg −1 , and the mouse blood (20 μL) was withdrawn from the caudal vein 0.08333, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h after administration. The mobile phase used for chromatographic separation by gradient elution was composed of acetonitrile and water (0.1% formic acid). The analytes were detected by operating in electrospray ionization (ESI) positive-ion mode using multiple reactions monitoring (MRM). The intra-day and inter-day accuracy ranged from 86.2 to 109.3%, the intra-day precision was less than 14%, and the inter-day precision was less than 15%. The matrix effect ranged from 85.3 to 111.3%, and the recovery of the analytes after protein precipitation were all above 78.2%. This method had the advantages of high sensitivity, accuracy, and recovery, and it had excellent selectivity, which enabled it to be applied to measuring the pharmacokinetics of the analytes in mice.",

HPTLC was performed on aluminium foil plates coated with 200 μm silica gel 60F254. Linear ascending development with toluene-ethyl acetate 7:3 (v/v) was performed at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) in a twin-trough glass chamber saturated with mobile phase vapour. Compact bands (RF 0.52 ± 0.02) were obtained for AKBA. Spectrodensitometric scanning was performed in absorbance mode at 250 nm. Linear regression analysis of the calibration plots showed there was a good linear relationship (r2 = 0.9989 ± 0.0002) between peak area and concentration in the range 200–1200 ng band−1. The method was validated for precision, recovery, robustness, specificity, and detection and quantification limits, in accordance with ICH guidelines. The limits of detection and quantification were 3.06 and 9.29 ng band−1, respectively. The recovery of the method was 99.35–100.21%. AKBA was subjected to various stress test conditions — acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation, photodegradation, and dry and wet heat treatment. Degradation products were well resolved from the pure drug with significantly different RF values. Statistical analysis showed the method could be successfully applied for the estimation of AKBA in herbal extract and in nanoparticles. Because the method could effectively separate the drug from its degradation products, it can be regarded as stability-indicating.",

Despite that the enhancement ratio of alaptide in a steady state was 1.7, the pseudo-enhancement ratio of alaptide in the time range of first to third hour was 2.3.

    "abstract": "A newly proposed method for detecting content of adriamycin in pectin–adriamycin conjugate has been developed and evaluated. The content of adriamycin was detected by selective degradation of adramycin to adriamycinone. It was realized by a two-phase reaction system (water–chloroform reaction system), in which adriamycin was quantitatively converted to adriamycinone. Therefore, the latter can be used to calculate the precise content of adramycin in the polymer drug. To develop the method, the catalyst for degradation, the extraction solvent for adriamycinone, the temperature and time of degradation, and the ratio of pectin–adriamycin conjugate were investigated. The optimal reaction condition was as follows: 30 mg of pectin–adriamycin conjugate dissolved in 25 mL of water was added to a mixture of 25 mL of hydrochloric acid (1.5 mol/L) and 50 mL of chloroform; the mixture was heated to 40 °C to react for 1.5 h; after that, the mixture was extracted with chloroform for three times, and then the organic layer was combined and, subsequently, evaporated to remove solvent. Under this condition, adriamycinone generation rate reached 99.87%. The quantitative method was evaluated for linearity, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ), recovery, accuracy, robustness, and precision. The recoveries were between 99.47% and 101.07% with relative standard deviation &lt;1.23%. The LOD and LOQ were 0.06 and 0.17 μg/mL, respectively. Compared to the traditional ultraviolet (UV) detection, this method is considered to be more precise for detecting content of adriamycin in its polymer conjugate.",

Various factors, such as concentration of the analyzed compounds and redox agents, storage time, and temperature, were analyzed. The degradation process of chosen antibiotics was observed chromatographically and fitted to the kinetic models, obtaining model parameters ( k , t 0.1 , t 0.5 ).

Various MSPD parameters like type of dispersant, sample–dispersant ratio, solvents, its volume, and time of extraction have been optimized after many trials. Furthermore, HPLC method has been developed and optimized for the analysis of all four components. The HPLC separation was achieved using a 250 × 4.6 mm column, particle size of 5 μm, C 18 reverse phase column, with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.05% H 3 PO 4 , in gradient elution mode with a mobile phase flow rate of 1 mL/min, using ultraviolet (UV)–visible detection at 254 nm. All calibration curves showed good linear regression ( r 2 ≥ 0.9925) within test ranges. The extraction recoveries of the marker constituents analyzed by MSPD methods were found as ranging from 97.5% to 103.5%. From comparing the chromatograms, validation data and other parameters like time, labor, and feasibility, we found that MSPD technique was most suitable for the analysis as compared to conventional liquid–liquid extraction technique.",

Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used for quantitative analysis, m / z 222.1 → 165.1 for carbofuran, m / z 238.1 → 180.9 for 3-hydroxycarbofuran and m / z 290.2 → 198.2 for an internal standard. The standard curves of carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran in duck liver were within a range of 2–2000 ng/g, where the linearity was good, the lower limit of quantification was 2 ng/g. The intra-day precision of carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran was &lt;14%, and the inter-day precision was &lt;13%, the accuracy range was between 91.8 and 108.9%, the average extraction efficiency was higher than 75.1% with a matrix effect between 93.4 and 107.7%. The developed method was applied to a situation of suspected duck poisoning at a local farm.",

A method based on online turbulent flow chromatography (TFC) combined with LC-MS/MS has been established for rapid quantitative determination of eight ARs in human blood and urine. This method, which does not require time-consuming pre-processing steps, renders it especially suited for use in emergency poisoning cases. Sample preparation, including extraction, centrifugation, and filtration, was followed by online clean-up using TFC. The total run-time was within 13.5 min, including online purification, chromatographic separation, and re-equilibration of the TFC system. The parameters for sample extraction, purification, separation, and detection in this study were optimized separately. The linear regression coefficients of matrix-matched calibration standard curves established for quantification were greater than 0.9976. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for the method were found to be 0.3–3.0 ng/mL in human blood and 0.06–0.6 ng/mL in urine. The recoveries of spiked target compounds at different concentrations in human blood and urine were 91.8–111.9% and 86.9–105.3%, respectively. Inter- and intra-day precision values were both less than 12.5%, and the matrix effects of human blood and urine samples for ARs were 75.3–108.6% and 102.7–130.0%, respectively. This method had successfully applied to the emergency detection of ARs in biological samples of poisoned patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to the wide applicability of separation techniques that rely on the property of differential migration in pharmaceutical formulations analysis, different analytical strategies have been proposed to resolve mixtures of multi-components pharmaceuticals. Three separation methods were developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of Paracetamol (PAR), Pseudoephedrine HCl (PSE) and Chlorpheniramine maleate (CHP). The first method is a thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) separation, followed by densitometric measurement. The separation was carried out on aluminium sheet of silica gel 60 F 254 using ethanol:chloroform:ammonia (1:7:0.4, by volume) as the mobile phase. Determination of PAR, PSE and CHP was successfully applied over the concentration ranges of 3–25 µg/band, 0.5–10 µg/band and 0.1–6 µg/band, respectively. The second method is HPLC separation that was achieved on C18 column using the mobile phase acetonitrile:phosphate buffer pH 5 (10:90, v/v) at a flow rate 1 mL min −1 . PAR, PSE and CHP were determined by HPLC in concentration ranges of 5–400 μg mL −1 , 2–40 μg mL −1 and 0.5–16 μg mL −1 , respectively. The third method is a capillary electrophoresis (CE) separation. The electrophoretic separation was achieved using 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 20 kV. The linearity was reached over concentration ranges of 30–250 μg mL −1 , 5–50 μg mL −1 and 0.8–20 μg mL −1 for PAR, PSE and CHP, respectively. The developed methods were validated with respect to linearity, precision, accuracy and system suitability. The proposed methods were successfully applied for bulk powder and dosage form analysis with RSD of precision &lt;2%. Moreover, statistical comparison with the official methods confirms the methods' validity.",

This paper presents the investigation and validation of a rapid, effective, qualitative and quantitative determination method of ivosidenib in rat plasma by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The samples were treated using acetonitrile precipitation to remove protein influence. Then, the supernatant was extracted to analyze plasma concentration traits. In the UPLC system, acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid were selected as a cosolvent mobile phase, applying a gradient elution to isolate compounds in a C18 column. Mass detections were performed on a triple quadruple mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. Electroshock characteristic fragment ionization was used for m / z 583.95→214.53 for ivosidenib for quantitative determination, m / z 583.95→186.6 for qualitative determination, and m / z 492.06→354.55 for IS. The selectivity, linearity, stability, accuracy and precision were verified by reaching the guideline criteria from European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The retention of investigated tropane alkaloids was interpreted by using the Soczewiński-Wachtmeister equation. A high correlation between the retention parameter (log k ) and lipophilicity (log P ) ( R = 0.9923) confirms the significant influence of hydrophobic interactions on the retention behaviour of the aforementioned compounds. It was found that by increasing the acetonitrile fraction, a decrease in retention of the more polar epoxide derivatives (scopolamine, norhyoscine) and an increase in retention of the more lipophilic derivatives (atropine, noratropine, homatropine) is obtained. The best separation of the tropane alkaloids was achieved by a simple procedure that involved a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and 40 mM ammonium acetate/0.05% TEA, pH 6.5; 50:50 v/v . Selected conditions were assumed for the determination of scopolamine hydrochloride in the eye drops ( Scopolamini hydrobromidum 0.25%).

    "abstract": "Abstract Indapamide (Indp) and certain other diuretics have been abused in sports, therefore, having sensitive methods for its detection and assay in biological fluids (whole blood, plasma, serum, and urine) is of significant importance. The racemic mixture of Indp is being used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient among other commonly prescribed diuretics. The regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical industries demand analytical methods for successful enantioseparation of such molecules. The paper presents a critical overview of the scientific issues of the application of contemporary techniques involving various chromatographic approaches (with liquid or supercritical fluid as mobile phases) and capillary electrophoresis and method development, for drug screening, assay, bioequivalence studies and enantioseparation of indapamide with their results. It also covers the historical developments that led to significant breakthroughs in research and concise evaluations of research in the area. Different types of chromatographic methods (HPLC, CEC, SFC etc) discussed herein provide an insight and a choice to select a method to (i) screen Indp for drug abuse, (ii) separate, isolate and quantify the enantiomers of Indp and (iii) investigate their pharmacokinetics as markedly different species and not as a total drug . The article evaluates the field's status with a broad base and practical oriented approach so that the underlying principles are easily understood to help chemists and non-specialists gain useful insights into the field outside their specialization and provide experts with summaries of key developments. To the best of authors' knowledge there has been no attempt to review such methods for analysis of Indp and this is the first report of its kind.",

In this study, a rapid and sensitive bioanalytical method was developed and validated to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of total and free doxorubicin in plasma of 3 Chinese patients after intravenous infusion of this injection. Plasma samples were prepared by protein precipitation for the determination of total doxorubicin, while solid phase extraction was used to determine free doxorubicin. After plasma sample pre-treatment, total and free concentrations were quantified individually using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The calibration curves were found to be linear in the range of 0.20–500.0 ng mL −1 for total doxorubicin and in the range of 1.00–1,000 ng mL −1 for free doxorubicin. The free concentrations in plasma were only one sixth to one quarter of the total levels. Liposomal doxorubicin had a longer apparent half-life (&gt;50 h) than the non-targeted drug (&lt;10 h) reported in the reference. and a lower volume of distribution. This novel injectable formulation steadily released free doxorubicin from liposomes over a long period of time to reduce cardiac toxicity and side effects, while ensuring a clinical curative effect.",

This thermodynamically based relationship applies to the retention of low-polarity solutes on low-polarity stationary phases. It can also be used for simple correlation between I(i) and TB(i), enabling prediction of the retention parameter (i.e. I(i)) for members of a congeneric set of solutes from their respective boiling points only. This new relationship can, however, also be used in an alternative and simple way of determining the Gibbs free energy of vaporization of one methylene group (CH2) of n-alkanes (p(CH2)). The performance of the new relationship in purely statistical terms and also in the evaluation of numerical values of the magnitude (p(CH2)) was assessed by comparison of retention data with literature values for selected carbonyl compounds, i.e. for certain aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, on four stationary phases of different polarity.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY The operating conditions for preparative chromatography, as for any industrial process, must be optimized. Such optimization is based on thorough understanding of process variables and economics. Optimization of the operating conditions is the best justification for detailed study of the fundamentals of nonlinear chromatography. It is difficult to optimize a separation without a clear understanding of how the thermodynamics of competitive phase equilibria, the finite rate of mass transfer, and dispersion phenomena combine to affect the individual band profiles of the components to be separated. The operating conditions determine the objectives of the process – yield, productivity, and, ultimately, the cost of the separation. Because of the severe nonlinearity of the chromatography model, the problem of optimization is difficult to solve, and because of the large number of operating variables and the complexity of the objective functions, the solution found can easily be the result of trapping in a local optimum. It is, therefore, necessary to use an effective mathematical tool for global optimization of nonlinear problems. In this work a chromatographic process for separation of the cis and trans isomers of furyl analogues of natural plant terpenes from a real post-synthesis mixture has been optimized. Typical problems during the optimization, which are discussed below, were: (a) formulation of a model of the process dynamics; (b) specification of model variables such as isotherm data, system efficiency, and physicochemical properties of the system; (c) specification of the objectives of the separation process and the process operating variables; and (d) selection of the optimization procedure.",

    "abstract": "Summary The process of steam co-gasification of hard coal and biomass is regarded as environment friendly alternative to classical fossil fuel combustion, especially in the light of continuous increase in energy demand and recognition of environmental concerns related to fossil fuel processing. In the paper, the results of experimental comparative study of steam gasification and co-gasification of hard coal and energy crop (Andropogon gerardii) biomass in a laboratory-scale fixed bed reactor at the temperatures of 700, 800, and 900°C are presented. The gas chromatography technique was used in analyses of concentrations of the main product gas components, that is, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane. Some regularities in terms of variations between gasification and co-gasification product gas composition were observed, e.g., carbon monoxide content in biomass gasification and co-gasification product gas was on average approximately half the amount observed in hard coal gasification. Application of Fe2O3 and CaO in co-gasification led to increase in hydrogen content with simultaneous CO2 capture. Chemisorption of CO2 with CaO in the process of steam co-gasification was effective at 700°C and 800°C and resulted in average hydrogen content increase from 61 to 87%vol and from 62 to 76%vol at 700°C and 800°C, respectively, when compared to co-gasification without Fe2O3 and CaO.",

    "abstract": "Summary A reliable and sensitive reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection method was developed and validated for the quantification of hopantenic acid in human plasma. Hopantenic acid, with protocatechuic acid as the internal standard (IS), was extracted from plasma samples using a liquid-liquid extraction with methanol. A chromatographic separation was achieved on a Luna C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 5-μm particle size) and precolumn of the same sorbent (2.0 mm). An isocratic elution, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1, was used with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, water, and 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid. The UV detector was set to 205 nm. The elution times for hopantenic acid and IS were ∼4.3 and 5.4 min, respectively. The calibration curve of hopantenic acid was linear (r > 0.9994) over the range of 0.5–100 μg mL−1 in human plasma. The limit of detection and limit of quantification for hopantenic acid were 0.034 and 0.103 μg mL−1, respectively. The present method was successfully applied for the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters of hopantenic acid following single oral administration of tablets containing 250 mg hopantenic acid to healthy volunteers. For hopantenic acid, the data showed a mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 2.32 μg mL−1, with a time to reach peak plasma concentration (tmax) of 1.56 h.",

Therefore, there is a demand to remove its contribution from the signal response. Elimination of baseline contribution is justified by increasing the data mining output, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Behavior of the baseline content is not perfectly constant on the time axis, and it is often necessary to experiment with gradient changes. However, the behavior could be parametrized using a technique derived from statistical moments. In this article, we propose adaptive thresholding as an unsupervised method for baseline removal from the measurement data. Results of a real analyte measurement are discussed to illustrate its efficiency.",

The wine yeast species used was Saccharomyces cerevisiae AXAZ-1, and fermentations were conducted between 20 and 2°C. At low temperatures, maximal ethanol productivity and fermentation rate were reduced. The rate constants, determined through a mathematical model obtained from RFGC, were higher in the laboratory scale comparing to the scale-up system at the temperatures of 20 and 15°C. However, with the reduction of temperature, both systems presented almost similar values proving the great fermentative ability of immobilized cells even at extremely low temperatures. Activation energies of the alcoholic fermentations in the two systems presented their higher values at the second phase (stationary) compared to those observed at the other two phases (growth and decline).",

While its therapeutic application is increasing, its bioavailability of different administration routes has not been studied. In the present study, we developed and validated a liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS). Using this method, we quantified dauricine in rat plasma after administration via intravenous (i.v.) injection, per oral (p.o.), and intraperitoneal injection (i.p.). Our results indicated that this method detected plasma dauricine with a good linearity in the range of 1.95–1000.00 ng/mL (r = 0.9997). The extraction method showed an average intra- and inter-day recovery of 98.21–104.35% and 98.0–103.58%, respectively. Dauricine showed a fast absorption and widespread distribution after administration in all three tested routes. After intravenous administration (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg), the pharmacokinetics of dauricine exhibited a first-order kinetics. In addition, dauricine showed a slow elimination with a long half-life (t1/2z) and double peaks phenomenon following p.o. and i.p. administration. Furthermore, using area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), we calculated absolute bioavailability, which was over twofold higher when administered via i.p. than via p.o. administration. The newly obtained information from our study will provide important reference for dauricine dose and administration route in designing dauricine therapy for applicable diseases.",

    "abstract": "Summary A new, simple and reproducible HPTLC-densitometric method has been established and validated for estimation of trigonelline in leaves of Abrus precatorius L. and its herbal formulation Chatak® using ICH guidelines. Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) as an alternative to convention techniques was also explored for the rapid extraction. The methanol extracts of leaves, its formulation, and standard solution of trigonelline were applied on silica gel F254 HPTLC plates and developed in twin chamber using mobile phase toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid-methanol (2:3:1.8:3.8, v/v/v/v). The plates were scanned at 268 nm (λmax of trigonelline) using Camag TLC scanner 3 with CATS 4 software. A linear relationship was obtained between response (peak area) and amount of trigonelline in the range 40–200 ng spot−1; the correlation coefficient was 0.9957. ASE method has higher extraction efficiency in less time as compared to Soxhlet extraction. The HPTLC-densitometric method showed good linearity, recovery and high precision of compound. It is useful to analyze trigonelline in A. precatorius leaves and routine quality control of its marketed formulation.",

    "abstract": "Summary A simple, selective, precise, and stability-indicating high-performance thinlayer chromatography (HPTLC) method for the analysis of ciprofibrate both in bulk drug and pharmaceutical formulation has been developed and validated. The method employed HPTLC aluminum plates precoated with silica gel 60 RP-18 F254 as the stationary phase. The solvent system consisted of methanol-water-triethylamine (2.8:2.2:0.2 υ/υ). The system was found to give compact spot for ciprofibrate (RF value of 0.55 ± 0.02). Densitometric analysis of ciprofibrate was carried out in the absorbance mode at 232 nm. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r2 = 0.998 ± 0.0015 with respect to peak area in the concentration range 600–1600 ng per spot. The mean values ± SD of slope and intercept were 3.38 ± 1.47 and 986.9 ± 108.78, respectively, with respect to peak area. The method was validated for precision, recovery, and robustness. The limits of detection and quantification were 17.84 and 54.08 ng per spot, respectively. Ciprofibrate was subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, oxidation, and thermal degradation. The drug undergoes degradation under acidic and basic conditions. This indicates that the drug is susceptible to acid and base. The degraded product was well resolved from the pure drug with significantly different RF value. Statistical analysis proves that the method is repeatable, selective, and accurate for the estimation of investigated drug. The proposed developed HPTLC method can be applied for the identification and quantitative determination of ciprofibrate in bulk drug and pharmaceutical formulation.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY Important aspects of the rapid gelling of the stabilized silica sols used to produce silica gel have been studied. Rapid gelling is necessary when producing micro-spherical silica gels from stabilized silica sols, because silica sol emulsions are not stable for long periods of time. The effect on rapid gel formation of potassium silicate, added to the silica sol before emulsification, has been studied and the possibility of efficient control of these processes has been investigated. It has been shown that it is possible to control the gelling of silica sol by adding potassium silicate, which not only secures rapid gelling of emulsified silica sols but also ensures introduction of active silica to the silica hydrogel, which reinforces the structure of the gel obtained. The effect of exchange of intermicellar water in micro-spherical silica hydrogels, by acetic acid, acetone, and ethanol, on the sorption volume of micro-spherical silica gels obtained from stabilized silica sols has been investigated. The use of stabilized silica sols as initial raw material ensures constancy of specific surface area and pore volume, because these primarily depend on the properties of the colloidal particles and their size distribution. Data characterizing the pore structure of the silica gels reveal that exchange of intermicellar water by other liquids of lower surface tension affects the pore volume only.",

Statistical analysis of the data obtained reveals a relatively high correlation between the increase in absorption and the paraffin oil content of impregnated RP-2 TLC plates.

The aglycon moieties of glycosidically bound aroma compounds were isolated using methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) extraction following enzymatic hydrolysis. The GC × GC–TOFMS analysis was performed to comprehensively identify different forms of the released aroma components in Flos Chrysanthemi. The result shows that the limit of detection of the released aglycon moieties ranged from 0.3 to 3.1 ng/mL, the recovery of the released 1-octanol was better than 98.3%, and the intra-day and inter-day precisions of this method were 0.2 to 8.9% and 1.3 to 9.1%, respectively. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of four types of Flos Chrysanthemi (Chuju, Boju, Hangju, and Gongju). A total of 60 aglycon moieties of interest were identified in the four types of Flos Chrysanthemi. These aglycones mainly consisted of aliphatic, aromatic, monoterpene, C13-norisoprenoids, and miscellaneous compounds.",

    "abstract": "Trypsin inhibitors have been described in peanuts and their derived industrialized foods, demonstrating diversity and thermoresistance. Given their most varied applications, these enzymatic protease inhibitors have been isolated and characterized for their potential use as bioinsecticides, herbal medicines, or medicines, but it is not simple. There are still no reports in the literature of the isolation and characterization of trypsin inhibitors in cultivar cavalo rosa (CCR) peanut, a common variety in Brazil. However, there are biological activities related to trypsin inhibitors from peanut-derived products. In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel trypsin inhibitor in CCR peanuts ( Arachis hypogaea L.) under different processing conditions using a simple improved isolation. Raw and toasted peanut inhibitor was isolated by ammonium sulfate fractionation and trypsin-cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose® 4B (CNBr-Sepharose® 4B) chromatography. The inhibitors from raw and toasted peanut were called AhTI1 and AhTI2, respectively, with potent anti-trypsin activity. Activity at different temperatures and pH was evaluated, and both samples were similarly stable under tested conditions. Minimum concentration for inhibition to occur (IC 50 ) was 2.78 × 10 −10 M and 2.39 × 10 −10 M for AhTI1 and AhTI2, and inhibition constant (Ki) was 3.26 × 10 −10 M and 1.54 × 10 −10 M, respectively, showing non-competitive reversible kinetics. We concluded that AhTI1 and AhTI2 presented highly specific to trypsin and stable to toasting, different temperatures, and pH ranging. These are important characteristics in the process of developing bioinsecticides or biopharmaceuticals. Thus, this may be an interesting molecule, aiming at its biotechnological application, and it was obtained using a simple and easy isolation process.",

Organic solvent was used for lutein extraction. The extract was injected into a HPLC-MS/MS system. Reversed phase chromatography was performed on a C18 column in gradient mode. Lutein and internal standard (phenytoin sodium) were identified in atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode using ion transitions of m/z 567.5&gt;549.4 and 205.2&gt;110.8, respectively. The lutein quantification assay was linear over concentrations ranging from 4 to 500 ng/mL. The lower limit of quantification was 4 ng/mL with satisfactory precision and accuracy. The assay presented acceptable intra and inter-batch precision (RSD%) and accuracy (RE%) &lt;8.16% in SD rat plasma and &lt;12.80% in human plasma. The extraction recovery ranged from 50.94 to 60.90% in SD rat plasma and 68.73% in human plasma. The matrix effect for lutein was acceptable and had minimal influence on the results. The method was then applied to determine the lutein concentrations in human plasma after a single oral dose of 20mg lutein. The method described is rapid, selective, sensitive and reproducible. This method can be used for both pharmacokinetic studies and therapeutic drug monitoring purposes.",

Samples were extracted with ethyl acetate and on-line cleaned up through a Turbo Flow solid-phase extraction column without time-consuming pretreatment before HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Sample pretreatment conditions, Turbo Flow conditions and mass spectral parameters were optimized and obtained eight glucocorticoids calibration curves. These curves showed good linearity over the concentration from 0.2 μg/kg to 50 μg/kg with an average recovery from 71.63% to 117.36%.

To avoid this, PZA in lipid core-shell nanoarchitectonics has been formulated to target lymphatic uptake and provide metabolic stability to the incorporated drug. The UPLC-MS/MS method for reliable in vitro quantitative analysis of pyrazinamide (PZA) in lipid core-shell nanoarchitectonics as per ICH guidance was developed and validated using the HILIC column. The developed UPLC-MS/MS method is a simple, precise, accurate, reproducible, and sensitive method for the estimation of PZA in PZA-loaded lipid core-shell nanoarchitectonics for the in vitro determination of % entrapment efficiency, % loading of pyrazinamide, and microsomal stability of lipid core-shell nanoarchitectonics in human liver microsomes. The % entrapment efficiency was found to be 42.72% (±12.60). Lipid nanoarchitectonics was found to be stable in human liver microsomes, where %QH was found to be 6.20%, that is, low clearance. Thus, this formulation is suitable for preventing PZA-mediated extensive liver metabolism. These findings are relevant for the development of other lipid-mediated, suitable, stable nanoformulations containing PZA through various in vitro methods.",

    "abstract": "The applicability of gas chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) for determination of dioxins in soil was investigated. The analytical method was validated based on US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1613 and European Union (EU) Regulation No. 709/2014 for selectivity, linearity of sensitivity, and instrumental limits of quantification (iLOQs). Method development commenced with determination of retention times for 17 native polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and selection of characteristic ions from GC–MS/MS spectra. The linearity was measured using 1613 standard solutions (CS1–CS5) containing 0.5 to 200 ng/mL tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin/furan (TCDD/F) congeners, 2.5 to 1000 ng/mL pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin/furan (PeCDD/F) to heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin/furan (HpCDD/F) congeners, and 20 to 2000 ng/mL octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin/furan (OCDD/F) congeners. The correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) values ranged between 0.9990 and 0.9999, and the iLOQ values ranged from 0.052 to 0.350 pg/μL for TCDD/F congeners, with a relative standard deviation of 2.7–9.6%. The entire analytical method was verified by analysis of certified reference materials (BCR-529 and BCR-530), and the recoveries were 71.79–103.87% and 81.50–103.12%, respectively. Thus, the GC–MS/MS system provides an alternative to GC–high-resolution MS for the simultaneous determination of TCDD/F congeners in soil.",

Asian cuisine frequently uses this flavouring, just as in the processed items produced across the United States and Europe. This article dealt with a detailed discussion of physicochemical features, pharmacological actions, and different reported analytical methodologies for the estimation of monosodium glutamate. Monosodium glutamate is analyzed using a variety of techniques, including spectroscopy, chromatography, electrochemistry, electrophoresis, chemometrics, flow injection analysis, and biosensors. According to results of comparative research of analytical methodologies, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is most widely used method for analyzing monosodium glutamate which surpasses the gas chromatographic (GC) approach. All of the reported methods are accurate, precise, cost-effective, and sensitive. The European Union defined monosodium glutamate as a food additive that is permitted in some foods, but is subject to quantitative limits. Consequently, this study provides the analyst with an accessible path to quantifying monosodium glutamate's content for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",

The validation conditions involved isocratic elution mode, using a mixture of buffer solution at pH 2.2 and methanol (74:26, v/v) as the mobile phase, an Agilent® reverse phase column, model Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 (250 cm × 4.6 mm × 5 μm), a flow rate of 1.3 mL min −1 , column temperature 40 °C and detection at 343 nm. The method showed linearity in the range of 4–44 μg mL −1 , with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9998. Recovery obtained average values of between 99.71 and 100.84% and precision with average RSD values of &lt;2%. The robustness demonstrated by assessing the effect of seven variables (pH of the mobile phase buffer; percentage of methanol; filter brand; mobile phase flow rate; wavelength; column temperature and sample agitation time), with effect values for each variable lower than the calculated value of s√2 (1.43), showed that none of these factors had a significant influence on the analytical response.

Results showed advantages and benefits in relation to the official method and those reported in the literature. The application of the multivariate strategy, the choice of methanol, in a lower proportion in the organic phase, due to its low toxicity, economy and easier availability compared to acetonitrile, and the other organic solvents used was a promising and important alternative for the analytical method. Furthermore, the use of reversed stationary phase, common in quality control laboratories, provided an analyte retention time of 4.595 min, demonstrating good performance and speed in routine analyses.",

The method utilized an electrospray ion source and operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Venetoclax-d8 was used as an internal standard. Plasma samples were precipitated by acetonitrile containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and were separated by a Hypersil GOLD column (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-2 mM ammonium acetate (30:70, v/v) containing 0.4% formic acid.

The matrix in normal plasma, hemolytic or lipemic plasma had no significant effect on the detection results. The specificity, recovery and stability also met the acceptance criteria of guiding principles for the validation of biological sample quantitative analysis presented in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015). As a result, this method is particularly suitable for determining venetoclax in hemolytic or lipemic samples from children with acute myeloid leukemia.

    "abstract": "Abstract The current technologies for substandard and counterfeit drug detection are either too expensive for low-resource settings or only provide qualitative or semi-quantitative results. GPHF minilab™ is one of them based on thin layer chromatography(TLC) principles with a semi-quantitative capability by visual observation of the spot area and intensity for medicine quality analysis. Thus, its use as a quality control tool for pharmaceutical products has limitations as spot area and intensity visual observation by the naked eye highly varies from analyst to analyst. As such, in this study, the semi-quantitative technique has been transferred to a quantitative approach by capturing the developed TLC plate image using an Android-based mobile phone inside a simple carton box. Then, the spot area was quantified using justTLC software. The quantitative results were compared with the-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method as the golden standard. Accordingly, linearity was observed in the assayed range (80–120% label claim), and the correlation coefficients found were ( R 2 = 0.958, 0.997, 0.941, and 0.956 for Albendazole, Mebendazole, Artemether, and Lumefantrine, respectively.). The values are satisfactory. The %RSDs found were less than 2% for all drugs [intraday ( n = 6) (RSD = 1.17, 1.61, 1.87, and 1.64), and interday ( n = 18) (RSD = 1.16, 0.72, 1.12, and 1.18) for Artemether, Lumefantrine, Mebendazole, and Albendazole, respectively]. Moreover, comparisons of results obtained from the sophisticated CAMAG UV cabinet ( R 2 =0.991, 0.971, 0.946, and 0.967) and the developed simple carton box ( R 2 = 0.958, 0.997, 0.941, and 0.956) for Albendazole, Mebendazole, Artemether, and Lumefantrine, respectively. The values are comparable and reveal the accuracy of the method. Robustness testings' that were performed under different altered conditions revealed the robustness of the method (RSD less than 2% for all factors). Additionally the deviations from the golden HPLC results were on average −8.62% for albendazole, −3.79% for artemether, and −4.52% for lumefantrine samples. The developed method shows a satisfactory performance capability to utilize the GPHF minilab™ as a quantitative technique for medicine quality control purposes. It will be a very useful tool in a resource-limited setting. The target method profile, which encompasses a simple, low-cost, linear, precise, robust, accurate, and quantitative GPHF minilab™ system, was obtained for Albendazole, Mebendazole, and Arthemeter lumefantine combinations (Co-artem). The proposed method was successfully applied to analyze the content of the marketed medicines in the above mentioned tablets and offered acceptable deviations from the golden HPLC method. Automation of quantitative GPHF minilab™ was highly recommended to enhance the appropriateness and use of this system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In accordance with the International Coordinating Committee's recommendations, an acceptable UPLC-MS method is being developed for analyzing Relugolix stability under various stress scenarios. Stress conditions included exposure to 0.1 and 1 N acid, alkali, hydrolysis, peroxide, light, reduction, and heat. The mobile phase for this analysis was prepared by blending acetonitrile and a 0.1% orthophosphate solution in a 50:50 (v/v) ratio. A C18 Column with dimensions of 100 × 2.1 mm and a particle size of 1.7 µm was employed as the stationary phase. The wavelength at which detection was performed was 247 nm, and the flow rate was maintained stable at 0.5 mL min −1 . Strong linearity was shown by this method across a concentration range of 1.25 μg mL −1 to 7.5 μg mL −1 . The method's reliability was shown by ensuring all of the validation parameters fell within the acceptable range. Furthermore, forced degradation studies were conducted using standard drugs. Different stress conditions led to the formation of degradation products, which were successfully separated from Relugolix using the C18 column in combination with an auto-purification mass spectrometer. Among the stress conditions, alkaline conditions showed a lower degradation rate. Interestingly, seven distinct types of degradation products were identified from the degradation studies under acid, alkali, hydrolysis, hydrogen peroxide, light, reduction, and thermal conditions. Remarkably, these seven degradation products have not been reported in previous literature, making this study the first to document their existence.",

The objective of the present study was to design and verify a reverse-phase HPTLC method for the concurrent analysis of CNZ and DOM in commercial tablets that is fast, sensitive, and greener. As a green mobile phase, acetone and water in an 80:20 (v/v) binary ratio were used to simultaneously determine CNZ and DOM. The stationary phase was reverse-phase silica gel 60F254S plates. Concurrent measurements of CNZ and DOM were performed at 230 nm. Four different tools were used to assess the greenness of the current method: AGREE, AES, ChlorTox, and NEMI. For both medications, the current approach was linear in the 25–1,000 ng/band range. The accuracy, precision, robustness, sensitivity, and environmental friendliness of the suggested technique for the CNZ and DOM simultaneous detection were verified. The new method's profile was noticeably greener, as seen by the results of every greenness tool, including NEMI, AES (89), ChlorTox (1.08 g), and AGREE (0.83). Utilizing the current approach, the amount of CNZ and DOM in pharmaceutical tablets was found to be 99.53 and 98.87%, respectively. These findings validate the suitability of the existing method for measuring CNZ and DOM simultaneously in commercial tablets. The results of the proposed study indicated that measuring CNZ and DOM in commercial products could be done consistently with the current methodology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dillenia indica is one of the important medicinal plants and is extremely popular in many systems of medicine including ayurvedic, homeopathic, and siddha. Traditionally, different parts of this plant have been used to treat cancer, wound healing, diabetes, diarrhea, bone fractures, abdominal pains, cuts and burns. In the present study, a simple, precise, accurate and validated high performance thin layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method was developed for simultaneous estimation of three pharmaceutically active compounds i.e., betulinic acid (BE), β-sitosterol (BT) and lupeol (LP) in fruits, leaves, root bark and stem bark of D. indica . Standards and plant samples were applied on TLC aluminum plate precoated with 0.2 mm layer of silica gel 60F254. The plate was run in a twin glass chamber comprising toluene:methanol:chloroform (8:1:1, v/v/v) as a mobile phase which resulted in better separation of compounds. The plates were immersed in anisaldehyde-sulfuric reagent and then heated at 105 °C for 5 min in CAMAG TLC plate heater for appearance of bands. Densitometric scanning was performed at λmax = 525 nm using tungsten light source in CAMAG TLC Scanner4 armed with WinCATS software. R F values of BE, BT and LP standards and those of plant samples were found to be 0.38 ± 0.01, 0.54 ± 0.01 and 0.65 ± 0.02 respectively. The method was further validated by following the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. For BE, BT and LP, the linear regression data for the calibration plots revealed a satisfactory linear association with correlation coefficients ( r 2 ) = 0.9736, 0.9989 and 0.9957, respectively. Linear ranges for BE, BT and LP were 2,000–6,000 ng/band, 200–1,000 ng/band, and 200–600 ng/band respectively. Accuracy of the method was assessed by recovery study conducted at three different levels with the average recovery of 99.19, 99.69 and 100.95% for BE, BT and LP, respectively. The results exhibited the highest content of BE (0.148 ± 0.01%), BT (0.031 ± 0.01%) and LP (0.047 ± 0.01%) in stem bark. The developed method will be useful for routine and quality control analysis of fruits, leaves, root bark and stem bark of D. indica species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The simplest way to remove pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables is to wash them with tap water. However, this method is not effective enough. In this study, the effectiveness of different washing methods assisted by ultrasound on pesticide removal was investigated. For this purpose firstly, apples were soaked in a cypermethrin (CYP) and spirotetramat (SPI) solution, which are frequently used as insecticides. Subsequently, the apples were washed in solutions prepared with vinegar, lemon juice, and baking soda at different concentrations (0.5%, 1% and 2%) and assisted by ultrasound (2.5–5 min). The residues in the medicated and washed samples were analysed on an LC-MS/MS instrument after extraction using the QuEChERS extraction method. The results of the analysis showed that acidic vinegar and lemon juice were more effective than baking soda. Moreover, the application of ultrasound significantly increased this effect. When a 0.5% vinegar solution was assisted by ultrasound, 62% of the cypermethrin residue was removed and 82% of the spirotetramat residue was removed. These values were 51.5% and 49.6% higher than tap water, respectively. In conclusion, acidic solutions such as vinegar, which we can easily prepare at home, are highly effective in removing pesticide residues when assisted by ultrasound.",

The rat tail vein was used for the collection of blood samples at designated time intervals following intravenous (2.0 mg kg −1 ) and oral (6.0 mg kg −1 ) administrations. Plasma samples were pretreated with acetonitrile as a protein precipitant and methylcytisine as an internal standard. Febrifugine concentration in rat plasma was determined using the UPLC-MS/MS method, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using drug and statistics (DAS) software version for statistical analysis. The linear range of febrifugine in rat plasma was 1.5–1,500 ng mL −1 , meeting the precision, recovery, and stability requirements for determination purposes. Febrifugine had a half-life (t 1/2 ) of 3.2 ± 1.6 h after administered via intravenous route, while t 1/2 was 2.6 ± 0.5 h after oral administration. The developed UPLC-MS/MS method is facile to operate while adhering to rigorous methodological verification standards, rendering it suitable for investigating the pharmacokinetics of febrifugine; and bioavailability was determined as 45.8%.",

The purpose of the current study is to develop and validate the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method for the simultaneous determination of Paracetamol and Fexofenadine HCl. This approach was validated by the standards and The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and United States Pharmacopeia (USP) were followed in the development and validation of the method. The chromatographic conditions including a mobile phase comprised of a 35:65 buffer mix and acetonitrile with a 1.0 mL min −1 flow rate were used. A thorough investigation was performed, including linearity and range, specificity, robustness, accuracy, precision, solution stability, and system suitability. The outcomes of the studies have shown that, both Active Pharmaceutical ingredients i.e., Paracetamol and Fexofenadine HCl were separated in about 7.5 min. The variation coefficient for Paracetamol and fexofenadine HCl varied between 0.9992 R 2 and 0.9983 R 2 , respectively. The devised method was proved accurate, as API recoveries in both cases of Paracetamol and Fexofenadine ranged from (99.79%, 100.72%, and 98.64%) to (99.96%, 100.64%, and 99.00%). The method's accuracy was further demonstrated by the solution stability which was 99.84% for Paracetamol, and 100.53% for Fexofenadine HCl. The suggested method for simultaneously measuring Paracetamol and Fexofenadine HCl was established, validated, and there was no evidence of any excipient interaction was observed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tea's beneficial effects have long been attributed to its abundance of natural bioactive compounds; however, the influence of variations in these compounds on taste and aroma remains poorly understood. To investigate the relationship between metabolomic profiles and tea processing adaptability, this study employed sensory evaluation and untargeted metabolomics to compare four tea cultivars from Guangxi—Ying Hong No.9 (YH), Gui Hong No.3 (GH), Gui Cha No.2 (GC), and Mei Zhan (MZ)—cultivated under the same conditions. Sensory evaluation revealed that GH and MZ exhibited the highest quality in green tea and black tea, respectively, while GC showed moderate quality, and YH performed less favorably than the other three cultivars. Metabolomics analysis uncovered significant differences in the metabolic profiles among the four tea cultivars, with MZ and YH displaying higher levels of flavonol glycosides, and GC and GH showing elevated levels of organic acids and fatty acids. Pathway analyses of GH and MZ indicated that the differentially enriched pathways were primarily related to linoleic acid metabolism and flavonoid and flavanol synthesis. Correlation analyses further revealed that the sensory quality of green tea was closely linked to fatty acids and organic acids in fresh leaves, whereas the sensory quality of black tea was strongly associated with flavonol glycoside levels. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between metabolite characteristics and processing suitability in different tea cultivars, offering valuable insights into the development of tea germplasm resources in the Guangxi region.",

Our attention was unexpectedly attracted by a largely surprising observation that the concentration profile of 4-phenylbutyric acid on cellulose powder could be measured easily on a freshly developed chromatogram only after drying whereas on chromatography paper developed at room temperature it was hardly detectable, and became fully shaped only two days later. To explain this striking phenomenon we had to perform several additional experiments and, although the final answer is not fully conclusive, a tentative explanation can already be presented.",

Some sense of order is emerging in the lipolytic action of these tissues on their endogenous CL. This is probably related to the function of the tissues in vivo.",

Further research focused on the dependence of the growth of UV absorption in this region, on heating of the stationary phase, on the density of coverage of the silica matrix with alkyl ligands capable of aromatization. For thermal modification of the RP-2 stationary phase impregnated with paraffin oil a quantitative dependence was found between the growth of absorption in this UV region and the paraffin oil-content of the chromatographic bed. In this study the relationship between the thermally induced increase in UV absorption of RP-8 and RP-18-type stationary phases and Raman-scattering intensity in the aromatic region when the stationary phases are irradiated with a high-power neodymium laser is discussed. The results obtained confirm the assumption of a linear relationship between the growth of UV absorption in this region by the stationary phase as a result of its thermal modification and the density of coverage of the silica matrix with alkyl (octyl or octadecyl) ligands capable of aromatization.",

Meanwhile, field trials were conducted in accordance with good agricultural practice (GAP) to study their characteristics of residue degradation under the agricultural climate and cropping system of Guangxi Province. The separation effect of each target peak was good with a linearity range of 0.01–5 mg L −1 , a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.003–0.015 mg kg −1 and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01–0.05 mg kg −1 . The average recovery ranges of vegetable tomatoes and cherry tomatoes were 70.5–120.0% and 70.8–119.8%, respectively, with relative standard deviations ( RSDs ) of less than 7.1%. Field trials of seven fungicides in vegetable and cherry tomatoes showed that the half-lives ( t 1/2 ) of the dithiocarbamate fungicides (metiram, mancozeb, and propineb, defined as total residues determined as CS 2 ), pyraclostrobin, difenoconazole, dimethomorph, and azoxystrobin were in the ranges of 5.2, 12.7–17.8, 7.6–7.9, 6.6–6.9, and 6.3–6.6 d in vegetable tomatoes, respectively. The cherry tomatoes presented ranges of 4.3–4.5, 10.8–11.8, 6.7–7.0, 5.4–5.5, and 5.9–6.2 d, respectively. Combined with the final residue and market monitoring results, the results show that cherry tomatoes have significantly higher terminal residues, initial deposits, and maximum residues of seven fungicides than vegetable tomatoes, and these seven pesticides can be detected in cherry tomatoes purchased from three markets. Therefore, cherry tomatoes may be regarded as representative varieties of tomatoes in realizing residual extrapolation for the establishment of the maximum residue limit (MRL) value of fungicides in tomatoes and for conducting market monitoring.",

High variation in pharmacokinetic profiles of several antiepileptic drugs highlights the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring to estimate pharmacokinetic properties and consequently individualize drug posology. In this work, a simple, rapid and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for simultaneous quantification of carbamazepine and its metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, gabapentin, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine and its metabolite mono-hydroxy-derivative metabolite, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproic acid in human plasma for therapeutic drug monitoring. d 6 -Levetiracetam, d 4 -gabapentin and d 6 -valproic acid were used as internal standards. After addition of internal standards along with two-step protein precipitation and dilution sample preparation, plasma samples were analyzed on a C 18 column using a gradient elution in 5 min without interference. The calibration curves were linear over a 100-fold concentration range, with determination coefficients ( r 2 ) greater than 0.99 for all analytes. The limit of quantification was 0.5 μg mL −1 (0.1 μg mL −1 for oxcarbazepine, 2 μg mL −1 for levetiracetam, and 10 μg mL −1 for valproic acid) with precision and accuracy ranging from 3% to 9% and from 94% to 112%, respectively. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy values were within 15% at low, medium and high quality control levels. No significant matrix effect was observed in the normal, hemolyzed, lipemic, and hyperbilirubin blood samples. This method was successfully used in the identification and quantitation of antiepileptic drugs in patients undergoing mono- or polytherapy for epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Codonopsis Radix (CR) is recorded as the roots of Codonopsis pilosula , C. pilosula var. modesta and Codonopsis tangshen . It is difficult to evaluate the quality of CR because of the existence of many original plants. In this paper, a strategy integrating chromatographic analysis and chemometrics for the quality control of CR is proposed. Systematic analysis of the chemical composition of CR was achieved through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting. Based on the HPLC fingerprinting data, chemometrics, including unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised orthogonal partial least squares-discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA), were applied to classify all CR samples. Components with variable importance in projection values higher than 1 in the OPLS-DA model were selected as potential chemical markers for distinguishing the origins of CR. Finally, an HPLC method was validated for determining the five characteristic ingredients in the CR samples. HPLC characteristic fingerprints showed 17 common peaks for C. pilosula , 13 for C. pilosula var. modesta , and 9 for C. tangshen , and all of them showed good similarity (&gt;0.9). Additionally, there were 9 common peaks for all CR samples with relatively poor similarity, ranging from 0.607 to 0.970. PCA could differentiate CR from the three origins, except for a partial overlap between C. pilosula and C. pilosula var. Modesta , and the OPLS-DA model achieved excellent classification results. Eight components (peaks 12, 8, lobetyolin, 10, codonopsin І, syringin, 3, and 11) were selected as potential chemical markers. There was a large discrepancy in the contents of the five characteristic ingredients in all samples, with the relative standard deviation ranging from 36.0% (lobetyolin) to 85.9% (atractylenolide Ⅲ). The average contents of the five characteristic ingredients were similar between C. pilosula and C. pilosula var. modesta samples and notably higher than those of C. tangshen samples. Consequently, a rapid, precise, and feasible strategy was established for the discrimination and quality control of CR with different origins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rationale The bark of Eucommia ulmoides and the roots of Achyranthes bidentata are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, and their pairing appears in many traditional Chinese medicine formulas as a recognized compatible unit. However, the changes and interactions of the main components of these two formulas when paired remain unclear, and there is currently no standard or method for their quality control and assessment of pharmacological effects. Methods An optimized ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was established for the simultaneous identification of 10 components in E. ulmoides and A. bidentata using in vitro and in vivo models. Tributyltin methacrylate was the internal standard solution, and the blood samples were treated by an organic solvent precipitation method. Gradient elution was conducted on a C 18 column at 25 °C with 0.1% formic acid water:acetonitrile as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min −1 . Dynamic multiple response monitoring was performed in negative-ion mode using an Agilent Jet Stream electrospray ionization ion source. Results In negative-ion detection mode, eucommiol exhibited a good response, and the isomers ginsenoside Ro and achyranthoside C could also be well separated. The developed method accurately detected the five components with a low blood content. Compared to controls, the levels of ginsenoside Ro, chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa, and achyranthoside C increased; the contents of geniposidic acid and pinoresinol diglucoside were unchanged; and the levels of eucommiol, geniposide, β-ecdysterone, genipin, and achyranthoside D decreased in vitro . In vivo , the contents of geniposidic acid, geniposide, pinoresinol diglucoside, and β-ecdysterone were reduced; the contents of eucommiol and ginsenoside Ro were unchanged; and those of achyranthoside D, chikusetsusaponin Ⅳa, and achyranthoside C increased compared to the corresponding levels in the internal control. Conclusions A method for the quality control of the E. ulmoides-A. bidentata drug pair was established for the first time and the main components in 10 drug pairs could be determined simultaneously in vitro and in vivo . These findings show that the E. ulmoides and A. bidentata drug pair cause a compositional change, providing new ideas for the development of this combination to improve clinical efficacy.",

Forced degradation studies revealed the nature of the impurity and conditions required for enriching them. A Mass compatible HPLC method was developed to quantify only these two impurities using 25% ammonia and formic acid in water. Their mass numbers were identified using LC MS/MS with triple quadruple mass spectrometer coupled with a HPLC. These two impurities were then isolated from enriched products using preparative HPLC. These impurities were then characterized using Mass and NMR analysis along with Q-TOF elemental analysis.",

In this study, the drug was subjected to forced degradation under various degradation conditions, including acidic hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis, oxidative and thermal, to determine its inherent stability. To this purpose, a novel HPLC method was developed for the determination of degradation impurities of BRT. Alkaline hydrolysis test showed a selectivity towards breaking C–C bonds. This resulted to five DPs formed by chain scission reactions occurred at the pyrrolo-pyrimidine group between C6–C10 and C8–C9. Also, the ethylsulfonyl-azetidin-ylidene group was subjected to C–C bond cleavage at C12–C15 and C16–C18. Degradation products were further characterized with the use of liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS).",

This IMP-5.312 was synthesized and then characterized as 6-(3-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) butan-2-yl)-5-fluoropyrimidin-4-ol by the corresponding spectral information (MS, 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, and IR). The IMP-5.312 impurity was effectively quantified using an enhanced HPLC based-technique that was developed as well as validated. The approach made use of a Novapak C18 column with an inner diameter of 3.9 mm and a length of 150 mm (4.0 µm) for chromatographic separation. The analysis of IMP-5.312 was made at 45 °C, with a flow rate (isocratic) of 1.0 mL min −1 and a 256 nm detection wavelength. Acetonitrile, methanol, and 0.1% aqueous trifluoro acetate buffer (pH 4.0) were mixed at a ratio of 15:30:55 ( v/v/v ) to create the mobile phase for a 20 μL sample injection. The linearity range of 0.25281–1.51690 μg mL −1 had a correlation coefficient more than 0.99942, and the accuracy ranged from 89.3 to 100.3%. It was noted that the established HPLC based-technique was sensitive, specific, and precise. The technique was executed on the current batches of VRC API for IMP-5.312 analysis, and the outcomes were good. For quality control purposes during the manufacturing procedure of VRC, the identification as well as analysis of IMP-5.312 should be helpful. The in silico approach was applied to predict the IMP-5.312 toxicity. The reports indicated that IMP-5.312 in non-mutagenic and categorized as ICH M7 class-5 impurity.",

Methods Based on HPLC, taking the chromatographic peak of puerarin as the reference peak, the fingerprints of 10 batches of Wuwei Zhenju Tablets were established and the similarity evaluation was carried out to determine the common peaks. SPSS 26.0 and SIMCA 14.1 software were used to evaluate the overall quality of Zhenju Tablets by cluster analysis and principal component analysis. The contents of chlorogenic acid, puerarin, daidzin, isochlorogenic acid B, isochlorogenic acid A and aurantio-obtusin in the samples were determined by the same method. Results Twenty-six common peaks were identified in the fingerprints of 10 batches of Wuwei Zhenju Tablets, and the similarity evaluation was greater than 0.985. Ten chromatographic peaks were identified as neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, puerarin, daidzin, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B, isochlorogenic acid C, aurantio-obtusin and betaine. Combined with cluster analysis and principal component analysis, 10 batches of samples can be clustered into two categories, which can distinguish different Zhenju tablets. The model established in pattern recognition research can accurately identify Wuwei Zhenju tablets, and the prediction results are ideal. The six index components had a good linear relationship in their respective concentration ranges. The contents of chlorogenic acid, puerarin, daidzin, isochlorogenic acid B, isochlorogenic acid A and aurantio-obtusin in 10 batches of Wuwei Zhenju Tablets were 2.902–5.819, 3.693–49.680, 1.449–10.654, 2.768–7.724, 2.941–6.343 and 0.071–0.089 mg g −1 , respectively.

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of edible coatings (ECs) containing essential oils (EOs), such as that derived from the Thymus vulgaris plant (EO- Tv ), offers a natural option for preserving and increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetable products. However, considering their physicochemical properties, the incorporation of EOs into nanocapsules (NCs) represents an alternative to reduce their volatility and oxidation. In this way, quantitative determination of the EOs incorporated into NCs is necessary for simultaneous monitoring of their main components during the nanoencapsulation process, as well as for the future precise and accurate dosage of EO components in fruit and vegetable products. In this study, ECs were formed from NCs loaded with EO- Tv and sodium alginate (AL). The EO- Tv was characterized through GC-MS and GC-FID analysis, and it was found that the major component of EO- Tv was thymol, with an abundance of 30.91%. Subsequently, an analytical method based on HS-SPME-GC-FID was developed and validated for quantification of the EO- Tv encapsulated in NCs and incorporated into the EC. The method was found to be precise and accurate for quantification of the main components of EO- Tv in the formed EC. Once the analytical method was validated, it was established that the encapsulation efficiency was greater than 50% in the case of NC-EO- Tv purified via evaporation at reduced pressure. On the other hand, 35.78 μg cm −2 of thymol was quantified in the EC formed from the NCs and AL. The present work presents an analytical tool for simultaneous quantification of the main components of EO- Tv in NCs, as well as in the ECs formed with NCs, promoting its potential application in fruit and vegetable products.",

The target of this investigation was to establish a fast, precise, green, and extremely sensitive UPLC-MS/MS approach for quantifying the level of zanubrutinib (ZNB) in human liver microsomes (HLMs). The separation of ZMB and revumenib was achieved using C8 column and isocratic gradient of the mobile phase. The linearity of the constructed ZNB calibration curve was ranged from 1 to 3,000 ng mL −1 . The StarDrop software package including DEREK and WhichP450 modules was used in screening for the toxic alerts the in silico metabolic lability of ZNB. The AGREE score was 0.76 that approves the greenness of the established method. The low in vitro t 1/2 (17.61 min) and high intrinsic clearance (46.03 mL min −1 kg −1 ) of ZNB revealed that ZNB shares similarities with medications that have a high extraction ratio. The present LC-MS/MS approach is considered the first analytical methodology for assessment of ZNB metabolic stability in HLMs matrix. In silico data from WhichP450 and DEREK modules suggest that making small structural changes (bioisosteric replacement) to the carboxamide moiety during drug design can potentially improve the metabolic safety and stability of novel compounds relative to ZNB. These methods are essential for advancing the development of new pharmaceuticals, particularly in enhancing metabolic stability.",

The radical scavenging abilities of these active ingredients were evaluated based on the relative peak areas in the HPLC chromatogram. The results indicate that potent antioxidants are present in the anhydrous methanol extract of perennial fujimoto bean whole herb. Based on HPLC-MS analysis, it was found that the scavenging ability can be mostly attributed to the presence of three compounds: cyanidin-3-o-β- d -glucopyranoside, troxerutin, and rutin. The structures were identified based on the MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data.

In this work, a new method based on rapid-resolution liquid chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC/TOFMS) has been developed for identification and differentiation of major flavonoids in two kinds of Epimedium extract and rat plasma. The compounds were identified effectively based on the accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by RRLC/TOFMS. The fragmentation rules deduced by collision-induced dissociation (CID) were successfully implemented in distinguishing some of the isomers, further validating the results. By using the combined analytical techniques, a total of 40 major flavonoids in extracts of two kinds of Epimedium were identified within 30 min, including 31 common components and 9 characteristic components. After oral administration, three prototype compounds in rat plasma were detected by comparing the constituents measured in vitro with those in vivo, and five metabolites were identified by contrasting the fragmentation rules. The identification and structural elucidation of the chemical constituents provided essential data for further pharmacological and clinical studies on different species of Epimedium.",

The polymer was quantified by an external standard method with self-control, and the amount was expressed by the percentage of cefmetazole. The HPSEC method was validated for specificity, linearity, and precision. The chromatographic conditions, chromatographic performances, sensitivity, linearity, and precision of the developed HPSEC method and gel chromatography were compared, and both methods were subsequently used to determine the amount of polymer from seven batches of samples. The HPSEC method was fully validated. The time of isocratic elution for sample assay was less than 14 min. The results of comparison indicate that the developed HPSEC method was superior to gel chromatography. The Student t test results also showed significant difference in the amount of polymer from the samples obtained by the two methods. Thus, the HPSEC method with two obvious advantages, the superior sensitivity and a shorter analysis time, is more suitable for determination of polymer amount in cefmetazole sodium for injection to control the quality of the product.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq. (ST) has been used as an aromatic exterior-releasing medicine in clinical practice for thousands of years in China. Previous researches have revealed both volatile oil (STVO) and aqueous extract (STAE) from ST showed significant pharmacological activities, such as anti-virus, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, and immunoregulation. However, the influence between each other was still unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of three main flavonoids (luteoloside, apigetrin, and hesperidin) in STAE to illustrate the influence of STVO. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) method was established to quantitatively analyze the three absorbed ingredients in the plasma of healthy rats. Biological samples were analyzed on an Agilent Eclipse Plus C 18 column (3.0 mm × 150 mm, 3.5 μm) with gradient mobile phase (containing 0.2% formic acid and acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. All the analytes and quercitrin (IS) were investigated with an electrospray ionization source (ESI) using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) in negative ionization mode. In addition, this quantitative method showed good linearities ( r ≥ 0.9995) and the lower limits of quantification were 0.590–1.19 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precisions ranged 3.47–10.45% and 4.29–11.28% for the three analytes. The mean extraction recoveries were in the range of 77.41–109.79% and the average matrix effects were within 83.41–112.67%. The validated method has been fully applied to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of the three flavonoid glycosides in rat plasma after oral administration of STAE and STAE+STVO. In comparison of luteoloside, apigetrin, and hesperidin in STAE group, it was found that different degree of increasing existed for the time to reach the maximum concentration ( T max ), elimination half-life time ( T 1/2 ), the area under the concentration curves (AUC 0→t and AUC 0→∞ ) and the maximum concentrations ( C max ) in STAE+STVO group. As can be seen from above results, STVO could improve the absorption and bioavailability of the three analytes. These findings would provide some active and strong basis of safe clinical application for ST and further exploitation for STVO from the perspective of drug–drug interaction.",

It is a crucial factor to select the proper time for collection of medicinal plants to assure maximum content of active components reflected as maximum efficacy. Olive leaves ( Olea europaea L.) are known traditionally for their antidiabetic effect. The secoiridoid glycoside oleuropein is the main active component of Olive leaves responsible for the biological activity. The current study was conducted to monitor the seasonal variation of oleuropein in Olives leaves collected from the same location. To achieve this goal a validated HPLC method following the ICH guidelines was established. Separation was conducted using RP18 column and a mobile phase consisted of ultrapure water containing 20% acetonitrile and 1% acetic acid. Detection was performed at 254 nm with 1 mL/min flow rate. The method was simple, linear, accurate, precise, specific and robust. The analyses revealed considerable variations in the level of oleuropein throughout the year. This variation cannot be explained by temperature variation during the year. Two points of high levels of oleuropein were detected prior to flowering stage and ripening of the fruits. The levels of growth regulators most likely is responsible for the increased production of oleuropein. It is recommended that leaves intended for medicinal use to be collected during the fruiting stage prior to fruit ripening.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several studies on the pharmacokinetic parameters of antidementia drugs have reported that plasma concentration is linked to the drugs’ efficacy and adverse effects. At present, there is no quantitation method that is highly sensitive and can be applied to simultaneous monitoring of the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine and its metabolites (NAP 226-90) in rat plasma. No methods fulfilling the assay validation requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency was also established. Therefore, this study developed a quantitative method for measuring rivastigmine and NAP 226-90 concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, examining plasma samples after rivastigmine administration. Rat plasma samples were prepared via the protein precipitation method. The methods for measuring rivastigmine and NAP 226-90 concentrations showed good fit over wide ranges of 1–100 ng mL −1 and 0.5–50 ng mL −1 , with lower limits of quantification at 1 ng mL −1 and 0.5 ng mL −1 , respectively. The plasma concentrations of rivastigmine and NAP 226-90 in six healthy rats were successfully determined, demonstrating the feasibility of applying the developed method. Thus, this research has successfully developed a sensitive, selective method, to simultaneously quantify rivastigmine and NAP 226-90 concentrations in rat plasma and be applicable to a pharmacokinetic study.",

The first high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method depends on the use of a cyanopropyl column at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min−1 with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 3.7 (10:90, v/v), for mix. 1 or acetonitrile-25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.0 by gradient elution, changing the proportion of the system linearly with a time schedule program, for mix. 2. Quantitation was achieved by UV detection at 220 nm. The second method was based on HPTLC separation followed by densitometric measurement of the spots at 254 nm. The separation was achieved on HPTLC silica gel F254 plates using chloroform-ethanol-water-acetic acid (5:8:2:0.5, v/v/v/v) for mix. 1 and chloroform-ethanol-water-acetic acid (1.5:8:2:0.5, v/v/v/v) for mix. 2.

Its impurities, degradation products and their formation pathways remain unknown. In the present study, two impurities (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxytlavone) and a degradation product (5,7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone) in Oroxylin A bulk drug substance were identified, and their formation pathways were proposed. A reversed phase liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of Oroxylin A and the three compounds was developed on a C18 column using methanol-acetonitrile-0.1% acetic acid (54:23:23, v/v/v) as the mobile phase. The detection was performed at 271 nm. The method was validated to be robust, precise, specific and linear between 4 and 40 μg mL−1; the limits of detection and quantification of Oroxylin A were 0.01 and 0.04 μg mL−1, respectively. The developed method was found to be suitable to check the quality of bulk samples of Oroxylin A at the time of batch release and also during its stability studies (long term and accelerated stability).",

In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) methods were developed for the analysis of metabolic components of BZT. The HPLC experiments used a reversed-phase Shim-Pack VP-ODS C18 column with the column temperature at 35°C and a mobile phase system consisting of aqueous formic acid (0.05%, υ/υ) and acetonitrile using a gradient elution at the flow rate of 0.2 mL/min−1. The ESI-MS was operated with a single-quadrupole mass spectrometer in both negative and positive ion modes. After oral administration of extraction of BZT, the rat's plasma, urine, and feces were also analyzed; 37 metabolic components including 23 original components and 14 transformative components of BZT were detected. The analysis of metabolic components in BZT by HPLC-ESI-MS methods could be a useful means of identifying the multi-components of BZT and understanding their possible metabolic mechanism of action in the body. The results also narrow the range of active compounds to be found in BZT, and pave the way for further pharmacology and active mechanism research.",

In this paper, we highlight the effect of storage conditions on the quantification of bioactive markers by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis in the crude plant material of PA. HPLC analysis of crude PA samples stored for certain period at long-term study (LS, 30 °C and 65% RH), accelerated study (AS, 40°C and 75% RH), and real-time study (RT) conditions was carried out using the LiChroCART Purospher® STAR RP-18 endcapped (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column along with a Purospher STAR RP 18e (4.0 × 4.0 mm, 5 μm) guard column using methanol:water (70:30) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL min−1 with ultraviolet (UV) detection at 220 nm. The HPLC study indicated that PA samples kept under LS condition are rich in lignan contents as compared to the samples stored under AS and RT study conditions. Therefore, PA should be used fresh to get maximum concentration of active lignans or it should be stored under LS conditions up to 6 months.",

The separation of the methanol extract of these formulations was achieved on silica gel 60 F254 aluminum backed TLC plates by using ethyl acetate-acetone-glacial acetic acid-formic acid-water 12:2:1:2:2 (υ/υ) as mobile phase. Densitometric analysis of icariin and l-arginine was monitored in absorbance mode at 270 and 195 nm, respectively. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots for icariin and l-arginine showed good linear relationship with r2 = 0.9984 +- 0.01 and 0.9968 +- 0.02, in the concentration ranges of 250–750 and 500–1500 ng/spot, respectively.

The limits of detection and quantitation were 72, 116 and 238, 383 ng/spot, respectively, for icariin and l-arginine. Statistical analysis proves that the method is repeatable and selective for the estimation of the targeted drugs. Since the proposed mobile phase effectively resolves the icariin and l-arginine, this method can be applied for the identification and quantitation of these components in herbal extracts and marketed formulations.",

By use of HS-GC-MS, characteristic fingerprints of the volatile fractions were obtained for plant species from two different vegetation seasons (2007 and 2008). Partial identification of the components of these volatile fractions was performed, and comparison of the chromatographic fingerprints confirmed seasonal fingerprint similarity within the same species. Preliminary 13C NMR measurements resulted in well shaped spectra with an abundance of regularly distributed signals.

In our earlier studies on the thin-layer chromatographic enantioseparation of certain low molecular weight carboxylic acids, lateral relocation thereof (i.e., the side-wise deviation of their migration route from linearity) was registered. Then we found out that lateral relocation was observed with these analytes only, which structurally resembled molecular rotors. In this study, we investigate the role played by the thin-layer chromatographic stationary phases in lateral relocation of botanically relevant molecular rotors. Thus, three carboxylic acids were selected as the test analytes, all of them resembling molecular rotors and abundantly present in the medicinal plant extracts. We selected two most popular thin-layer chromatographic stationary phases also, i.e., silica gel (characterizing with microcrystalline chirality) and alumina (achiral). Lateral relocation of the test analytes was observed on the silica gel stationary phase only. A conclusion was drawn that the chiral stationary phase makes a complementary contribution to lateral relocation (along with the propeller-like molecular structure of the analytes). In our view, specially devised thin-layer chromatographic systems can prove a convenient nano-platform for future investigation of the drug transport patterns, advantageous in the pharmacokinetic studies.",

The optimum composition of mobile phase for high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation was obtained. The elution profiles were calculated by the polynomial theory based on the retention factor ln k = A + BF + CF2 (F was the volume percentage of acetonitrile with 1.0% acetic acid); then, the theory was applied to calculate the elution profile in both isocratic and gradient modes by modifying different mobile phase conditions with HCI program. The calculated results of mobile phase condition suggested that acetonitrile-water (containing 1.0% acetic acid) with a linear gradient elution of 0∼30 min from 15:85 to 50:50 (v/v) was the optimized component. In the experimental conditions, the agreement between the experimental elution profiles and the calculated values of eluted concentration was relatively good.",

    "abstract": "Summary In our earlier studies performed with the use of thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), polarimetry, and several other instrumental techniques, we have provided abundant experimental evidence for the oscillatory chiral conversion and the oscillatory condensation of the low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids from the groups of profen drugs, amino acids, and hydroxy acids. We have also proposed several kinetic-diffusive models aimed at elucidation of these striking phenomena, which in the diffusive term assumed contribution from the density inhomogeneity of the investigated liquid systems. Moreover, each model laid special emphasis on the importance of cyclic H-bonded carboxylic acid homodimers of the SS and RR type. In this paper, we introduce a simple experimental approach enabling convenient registration of the density inhomogeneity in the S(+)-naproxen solution prepared in 70% aqueous ethanol. To this effect, we use a zooming scanner that is able to scan this solution in a Petri dish placed in UV light (λ = 254 nm). Scanning in the selected time intervals allows tracing the dynamics of supramolecular aggregation of the investigated profen drugs. The mobility of these aggregates can probably result from the energy released in the process of chemical polycondensation. The obtained results seem to correlate well with those originating from HPLC, and the relevant conclusions are drawn. It seems possible that the zooming scanner can prove helpful in monitoring some other interesting chemical processes as well, thus contributing to the studies on the mechanism and kinetics of the nonlinear organic reactions.",

The mass spectra of the preparation before and after treatment with alkali contained deprotonated ions [M-H]− recorded at m/z 3107 and 2856 which represented muropeptide fragments with 2 or 3 glucose residues, respectively, at the reducing end. Because of the lack of a free reducing group, muramyl residues remained untouched during the β-elimination reaction in a manner comparable with muropeptide fragments protected by 1,6-anhydromuramic acid represented in the spectra by [M-H]− ions with masses of 2451 and 2762 m/z. The ion [M-H]− at m/z 1615 which was proposed to represent a disaccharide fragment with one Glc residue linked had no counterpart in the spectra of lysozyme-liberated muropeptides and was supposed to have arisen from a dimer (ions [M + H]+ 2023 m/z and [M-H]− 2021 m/z observed for muropeptides not treated with alkali) after elimination of a GlcNAc-acetamidohexenopyranose fragment in the alkaline environment. According to a similar mechanism, the ion at m/z 2723 [M-H]− determined as a hexasaccharide fragment with an anhydromuramic acid residue at the end arose from a dimer represented by ion [M-H]− with mass 3128 m/z. The data presented suggest that glycan strands in rhizobium murein can be protected at the reducing end by short oligoglucans except for 1,6-anhydromuramic acid residues.",

The MIPs were prepared by noncovalent polymerization. Sulfamethazine (SMZ), methacrylic acid (MAA), and ethylene glycoldimethacrylate (EGDMA) were used as template, functional monomer, and cross-linker, respectively, in the presence of chloroform as solvent. The MIPs obtained were packed into a stainless steel column (150 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.) and used as the stationary phase for HPLC. The mobile phase was 23 mM NaH2PO4 buffer solution–acetonitrile, 2:1 (v/v), at a flow-rate of 1 mL min −1 . The sample volume injected was 20 µL and detection was by UV absorbance at 272 nm. The retention times of SMZ and SCP under these conditions were approximately 7.015 ± 0.182 min and 11.282 ± 0.925 min. The total run time for each sample was 12 min. The selectivity of the MIPs was evaluated by analysis of different substances with molecular structures similar to that of SMZ. Separation factors (α) were used to compare chromatographic data from the stationary phases. The values of α obtained, in the range 1.57– 1.72, showed that use of the MIPs enabled recognition of subtle structural differences from the template molecule. The limits of detection (LOD) of SMZ and SCP were 0.035 and 0.041 µg L −1 , respectively, and the respective limits of quantitation (LOQ) were 0.117 and 0.137 µg L −1 . The results showed that the SMZ-selective polymer was suitable for separating both SMZ and SCP.",

The study mainly illustrated that a green approach is essential in the medical sector with the help of “Green Analytical quality by design”. According to AQbD, the techniques of HPTLC have become eco-friendly, and decided to use “ESC” and “ETZ”. Hence, ethanol and phosphate buffer pH 3.5 adjusted with 1% “orthophosphoric acid”. After the retardation factor, the product ESC was found at 0.34 min and ETZ was found at 0.53 min. The linearity of ETZ the range varies from 300 to 1800 μg mL −1 and for ESC it varies from 100 to 600 μg mL −1 . The validation parameter of R 2 Values ranged from 0.9997 to 0.9994 for both ESC and ETZ. The study also demonstrated that different other methods were also useful for the medical sector to make it more convenient and eco-friendly. Some of those approaches are “GAPI”, “AGMS”, “NEMI”, and “AGREE”. The outcome of the study helped to find that the technique “HPTLC” is a green analytic design that helps to maintain the stability of the medicine and it was also approved as a quality design and also a novel approach in the pharmaceutical sector.",

The drift tube temperature of the evaporative light scattering detection system was set at 40 °C, and the pressure of carrier gas (N 2 ) was 337 kPa. The regression equation revealed a good linear relation ( r = 0.9993–0.9995) during the test ranges (119.1–1190.7 μg·mL −1 for 12-hydroxystearic acid, 10.7–107.4 μg·mL −1 for stearic acid). The detection limits of 12-hydroxystearic acid and stearic acid were 1.1 and 2.5 μg·mL −1 , the limits of quantitation were 3.2 and 7.4 μg·mL −1 , respectively. And the mean recoveries were 101.5 and 101.0%, the corresponding relative standard deviations (RSDs) were 2.1 and 2.8%, respectively. The RSDs corresponding to repeatability ( n = 6) were both less than 1.7% in terms of precision. As to the stability, the test results remained stable after 8 h at room temperature (RSDs were both less than 2.6%). The developed method showed high sensitivity, recovery, repeatability and stability, which indicated that the method could be applied as a quality evaluation method for the determination of stearic acid and 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid in PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil.",

Heartwood plant is the major source of dehydroabietic acid (DHAA) and abietic acid (AA), which possesses several medicinal properties, such as antiviral, antimicrobial, antiobesity and anti-inflammatory. The research proposed herein a low-cost, fast, specific, uncomplicated, sensitive, precise reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). This method was conducted and validated for evaluating an amount of DHAA and AA in ethanol extract and oral spray containing P. merkusii heartwood extract. Additionally, stability and antimicrobial activities against clinically isolated Streptococcus mutans of the oral spray were determined. The separation was achieved on Pursuit 200Å PFP column, 150 × 4.6 mm, particles of 3 µm with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min −1 . Methanol and water (70:30 v/v) were used as eluent with an isocratic mode and sample analysis volume was set at 10 µL, at a detection wavelength of 210 and 245 nm. The developed HPLC method for analysis of DHAA and AA showed good linearity with correlation coefficients equal to 1. Moreover, other validation parameters, comprised of accuracy, precision, specificity and detection and quantitation limits of this method displayed excellent reliability, validity and sensitivity. This method could be an interesting alternative for quantitative measurement of P. merkusii heartwood extract, oral spray formulation and other P. merkusii heartwood extract preparations. The result from antibacterial tests suggested that the oral spray containing P. merkusii heartwood extract is able to inhibit the oral pathogens causing dental caries. The oral spray decreased S. mutans population size by about 0.5–2 Log CFU mL −1 at 1–4 h and complete elimination of all bacteria strains within 24 h. This study provides validity for using P. merkusii heartwood extract as an alternative for preventing and treating oral infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Silica, as a stationary phase, has low separation efficiency accompanied by overlapping, broadened, and tailed peaks, so it needs to be modified to improve its efficiency. This study aims to develop a silica-based stationary phase modified by tetraethylene glycol (TEG) to separate phenolic compounds. Silica was modified by a chemical bond between silanol groups on the silica surface and TEG through a 3-glycidyloxypropylmethoxysilane reaction. The modified silica was packed into a capillary column and used to separate simple phenolic compounds consisting of phenol, pyrocatechol, and pyrogallol. A sample of 0.2 µL was injected into the capillary liquid chromatography and the mobile phase employed was acetonitrile 98% with a flow rate of 3 μL min −1 . Elution was also done isocratically in this process and detection was carried out at a wavelength of 254 nm. The mixture of simple phenolic compounds was successfully separated in less than 7 min. The asymmetry factor and resolution were 1.43–2.12 and 1.72–5.43 respectively. The number of the theoretical plates ranged from 213 to 7,857. Columns containing Si-TEG stationary phase also separate phenolic compounds, which consist of gallic acid, syringic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid. A sample of 0.2 µL was injected into the capillary liquid chromatography and successfully separated the mixture in less than 12 min. The samples were eluted isocratically using a mixture of methanol and 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 2.5 (8:92) with a flow rate of 3 μL min −1 . The phenolic acids compounds were detected at a wavelength of 280 nm. The chromatogram showed four separate peaks. The asymmetry factor and resolution were 1.53–1.63 and 1.14–1.74, respectively, but the number of the theoretical plates was low, ranging from 190 to 796.",

During the heating season, the dominating source of pollution is coal combusted in the region. Characteristics of organic contamination in precipitation sampled after the heating season indicate they are related to traffic emission.

The last two compounds are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) very popular throughout the world and sold in most countries over the counter. Before publication of our results pharmaceutical scientists were firmly convinced that the curative power of the S-(+) enantiomers of the 2-APAs was much greater than that of the R-(−) enantiomers. In this paper we will show that – because of the spontaneous oscillatory transenantiomerization of the 2-APAs – not only is the conformational instability of these compounds when dissolved in very simple low-molecular mass solvents (e.g. water, ethanol, etc.) well proved, but also that they cannot be precisely quantified by use of liquid chromatographic detectors based on absorption of UV light. Quantification by means of HPLC–UV, HPLC–DAD, and TLC–densitometry is burdened by substantially more experimental error than for compounds that do not spontaneously racemize by keto–enol tautomerism.",

The method uses with reversed-phase columns (graphite carbon and ODS), coated with fluorine-containing surfactant, and conductivity detection. A graphitized carbon column was selected for this study because of its high chemical stability, reliability, and reproducibility. Separation of common anions was achieved in 12 min. Calibration plots of peak area against anion concentrations were linear in the range 1–15 µg mL −1 for Cl − , 1–20 µg mL −1 for Br − and SO4 2− , and 3–20 µg mL −1 for I − and NO3 − , with good correlation coefficients (r 2 = 0.9922). Detection limits calculated for a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3 ranged from 0.76 to 0.98 µg mL −1 . The reproducibility of retention times was varied from 0.28 to 0.45 relative standard deviation (RSD,%) and reproducibility of chromatographic peak areas was 2.13–3.25 (RSD,%).The method was successfully applied to the determination of anions in acid rain and related natural waters, including rain, river, and underground water.",

The sample preparation involved a one-step protein precipitation method with methanol. The separation was performed on Inertsil® ODS3 C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) and maintained at 30 °C. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile–water (90:10 v/v) with fast isocratic elution at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min and a run time of 10 min. A mass spectrometer was run in the positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mode using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) to monitor the mass transitions. The MRM transitions were chosen to be m / z 360.1 → m / z 175.0 for PA-824, m / z 402.0 → m / z 383.9 for moxifloxacin, and m / z 237.1 → m / z 194.0 for IS. The method was fully validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, matrix effect, recovery, and stability, respectively. The method was successfully applied to drug–drug interaction (DDI) study of PA-824 and moxifloxacin in rats. The results show that the main pharmacokinetic parameters of PA-824, namely, T max , t 1/2 , and AUC (0– t ) , increased more in the PA-824 and moxifloxacin group than in the PA-824 group. However, there were little changes in the main pharmacokinetic parameters of moxifloxacin from single and combined groups.",

    "abstract": "The advent of disposable micro-columns will be a hope of workers of chromatography-related laboratories. A very critical and important requirement is the formation of affordable inlet frits. Welding a metal screen to a column inlet is not recommended because of the risk of damage to stationary phase. In this study, the Tollens probe (silver mirror reaction) was adopted to make affordable frits. Silver is reduced on the particle surface and in an empty space among the particles, forming a solid silver network structure at the column inlet area by injecting the reaction solution into the packed column at a depth of one third (10 cm) of the packed bed (0.5 mm × 300 mm). The silver cement structure was successfully formed, and the silver cement frit endured mobile phase flow well when C18 modified ground silica monolith particles were used to make the packed bed. The formation of the silver cement frit was not successful when the stationary phase based on conventional spherical silica particles was used. Negligible reduction of chromatographic performance by the silver cemented frit was observed. This study serves as the first step toward realization of disposable micro-columns.",

Traditionally, the molar heat capacity of a substance can be obtained directly by use of calorimeter [1]. Occasionally, however (e.g. when sufficient material is not available), this method can prove quite complicated. The question has thus been asked whether there are alternative possibilities of indirect measurement of this particular magnitude. In the work discussed in this paper we undertook this challenge by making an attempt to determine molar heat capacities for the three classes of compound, alkylbenzenes, aldehydes, and ketones, from simple chromatographic data originating from the capillary gas chromatography (CGC) and a set of specially devised mathematical models, complemented with appropriate statistical procedures.",

The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for nesfatin-1 were set at satisfactory values in the range 0.22–0.35 mg mL −1 and in the range 0.67–1.05 mg mL −1 , respectively (at two different wavelengths (DAD) and at four different wavelengths (FLD)). Analyte concentrations were determined as the average value from fetal bovine serum matrix samples. The preliminary results show that the SPE procedure on Isolute Si-TsOH (SCX-3) could be used for further nesfatin-1 analyses in human serum samples. Both the SPE technique, chromatographic analysis with gradient elution mode and detection technique are fast and convenient.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, the ingredients of this prescription have not been identified, and there are very few studies on the anti-diabetic mechanism of this prescription. Therefore, BHJRSTD was detected and identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Quadrupole-Exactive Focus Orbitrap MS (UHPLC–Q/Orbitrap/MS/MS). We identified 74 compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, chalcones, xanthones, phenols, phenylpropanoids, terpenes, triterpenes, amino acid derivatives, etc. Then, Sprague Dawley rats were fed with a high-fat and high-sugar diet for two months and injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The diabetic rats were randomized to given metformin (200 mg kg −1 ·d −1 , n = 15), BHJRSTD extracts (40 g kg −1 ·d −1 ) and BHJRSTD extracts (10 g kg −1 ·d −1 ) by gavage for 8 weeks. The results confirmed that BHJRSTD significantly decreased the level of MDA and increased levels of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), it shows that the prescription has significant antioxidant activity in the treatment of T2DM.",

And simple ADME and target prediction analyses were performed for C3A. Ethyl acetate was employed to precipitate protein with appropriate sensitivity and acceptable matrix effects. The satisfactory separation was developed on an ODS2 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm) by gradient elution with a methanol-acetic acid solution (pH = 3.0) as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.0 mL min −1 , the column temperature was maintained at 30 ± 2 °C, the injection volume was 20 μL, and the detection wavelength was set as 309 nm. The method was fully validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, extraction recovery and stability. The results of the ADME analysis found that C3A has excellent characteristics of drug-likeness, consistent with good bio-absorption. And the predicted 12 target protein belongs to the amine oxidoreductase and carbonic anhydrase target class. This method is simple, rapid, sensitive, and accurate for the determination of coumarin-3-carboxylic acid in the heart and liver tissue of SD rats.",

In this study, retention behavior of twenty-three previously synthesized dual DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV inhibitors was tested in RP-HPLC system, consisting of C8 column and acetonitrile/phosphate buffer (pH 5.5 and pH 7.4) mobile phase. logD was calculated at both pH values and the best correlation with logD was obtained for retention parameter φ0 , indicating that this RP-HPLC system could be used as an alternative to the shake-flask determination of lipophilicity. Subsequent QSRR analysis revealed that intrinsic lipophilicity ( logP ) and molecular weight ( bcutm13 ) have a positive, while solubility ( bcutp3 ) has a negative influence on this retention parameter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, a simple, fully validated and rapid reversed-phase HPLC with photodiode array detector method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 11 selected phenolic antioxidants over 33 min in personal care and food samples containing extracts of green apple, pomegranate (Ponica granatum) and argan oil (Argania spinosa). The method was performed using NUCLEODUR C18 column 5 µm particle size and 12.5 cm length. The HPLC mobile phase was prepared as follows, solution A: 1% aqueous acetic acid and solution B: Acetonitrile. The method was gradient at flow rate 1.0 mL/min with a simple mobile phase, minimal sample preparation, and diminished organic solvent usage (3% acetonitrile for almost 90% of the run time). The detection was carried out at 278 nm. The method presented good precision and accuracy with RSD% values ranged between 0.33 and 1.94% and wide linear range. The developed method was successfully applied on 67 personal care and food products present in Egyptian market and can be used for routine screening in laboratory for the regular quality control of the antioxidant content for products containing the mentioned extracts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bao-Yuan Decoction (BYD), a widely used traditional Chinese medicine formula, is worth developing into modern dosage forms. To assess the quality of traditional decoction, the commonly used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array and evaporative light scattering detection (UPLC-DAD/ELSD) method was initially applied to develop the analytical methods for the qualitative fingerprints and simultaneous quantitation of multiple marker compounds in BYD. Based on 16 batches of BYD prepared from multiple batches of qualified crude herbs combined randomly, the characteristic fingerprints were generated, with 41 and 19 common peaks detected by DAD and ELSD, respectively. Furthermore, ginsenosides Re, Rg 1 and Rb 1 , calycosin-7-glucoside, calycosin, liquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, isoliquiritin, glycyrrhizic acid and cinnamic acid were qualified as marker compounds to represent the herbs composing the formula. The characteristic fingerprints and the content ranges of multiple batches of the decoction were obtained, thus providing guidance for the quality control of modern dosage forms. The combination of these qualitative and quantitative methods will be an effective operational measure by which to evaluate and control the quality of BYD from traditional decoction to modern dosage forms.",

Several parameters affecting sweeping-MEKC method were studied systematically and the separation conditions were optimized as 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 –110 mM SDS and 40% (v/v) MeOH (pH 2.4), with −22 kV applied voltage and UV detection at 230 nm. The sample matrix is 60 mmol L −1 NaH 2 PO 4 and sample introduction was performed at 3 psi for 6 s. Separation of the four naphthalenediols was completed in less than 17 min. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) are 0.0045∼0.0094 μg mL −1 and 0.015∼0.031 μg mL −1 . Linear relationship ( r 2 &gt; 0.999) is satisfactory at the range of 0.1–10 μg mL −1 . The developed method has been successfully applied to the determination of the four naphthalenediols in real cosmetic samples, with recoveries in foundation, sun cream and lotion in the range of 92.3%∼106.8% and relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 4.15%. A HPLC method described in the National Standards of the People’s Republic of China was carried out for the comparison with the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed sweeping-MEKC method has the advantages of fast, low cost with comparative sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bicalutamide (BCL) has been approved for treatment of advanced prostate cancer (Pca), and vitamin D is inevitably used in combination with BCL in Pca patients for skeletal or anti-tumor strategies. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of vitamin D application on the pharmacokinetics of BCL. We developed and validated a specific, sensitive and rapid UHPLC–MS/MS method to investigate the pharmacokinetic behaviours of BCL in rat plasma with and without the combined use of vitamin D. Plasma samples were extracted by protein precipitation with ether/dichloromethane (2:1 v/v), and the analytes were separated by a Kinetex Biphenyl 100A column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.6 μm) with a mobile phase composed of 0.5 mM ammonium acetate (PH 6.5) in water (A) and acetonitrile (B) in a ratio of A:B = 35:65 (v/v). Analysis of the ions was run in the multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode. The linear range of BCL was 5–2000 ng mL −1 . The intra- and inter-day precision were less than 14%, and the accuracy was in the range of 94.4–107.1%. The mean extraction recoveries, matrix effects and stabilities were acceptable for this method. The validated method was successfully applied to evaluate the pharmacokinetic behaviours of BCL in rat plasma. The results demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic property of BCL is significantly affected by combined use of vitamin D, which might help provide useful evidence for the clinical therapy and further pharmacokinetic study.",

    "abstract": "We, the Editors and the Editorial Board Members of Acta Chromatographica, take an immense honour and great pleasure in conveying our best wishes to Professor Mieczysław (Mietek) Sajewicz, Co-Editor-in-Chief of our journal on the occasion of his 70th birthday.His contribution to establishing an international chromatography journal just in the Institute of Chemistry, University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland, at a difficult moment soon after the 1989 political setup transformation in our country is hardly possible to overestimate.It was only Mietek's passion for and his firm dedication to the separation sciences in combination with his enormous entrepreneurial skills that helped him put such a seemingly odd idea into a decently functioning practice, which resulted in the first volume of the journal released in 1992, and in all volumes which have followed thereafter, over the past almost thirty years.If today we tried to remind the adventures of all kinds at an initial stage of establishing our journal, it would sound too comical or too surrealistic to be cited, and yet an only person able to cope with multiple obstacles of that chaotic period of time has inevitably and always been Mietek.Although right from the beginning Acta Chromatographica was spurred by an ambition to become an international communication platform in the field of separation sciences, its initial 'supply network' embraced mostly the research laboratories of Polish academia.However, in the span of almost thirty years that followed, our journal has been gradually yet consequently rising, always under Mietek's watchful supervision, to eventually gather contributors and readers literally from around the globe.Mietek's obsession with separation sciences materialized in the form of yet another and also very precious contribution to the chromatographic community, and namely as a series of annual chromatography symposia held in a charming mountain resort of Szczyrk in South Poland, organized by the Institute of Chemistry, University of Silesia.Once again, Mietek's vision and entrepreneurial spirit have proved pivotal for the success of this initiative, which commenced in the 'prehistoric' year 1976 andspanning epochs and generationshas been uninterruptedly continued until now.Over the years, these symposia have attracted many participants from home and abroad, and in many chromatography centres across Europe they are known as the 'eternal' Szczyrk meetings.For these two initiatives, which have provided a convenient space for the development of separation sciences, Mietek deserves our unconditional and very loud thank you.Professor Mieczysław Sajewicz was born on March 23rd, 1951 in Sosnowiec, Poland.He studied chemistry at the University of Silesia in Katowice, from which he obtained his MSc (1978) and PhD (1989) degrees in analytical chemistry, with both theses focusing on applications of gas chromatography to studying factors governing separation quality (e.g., isomerism of analytes, polarity of stationary phases, and working parameters of the gas",
