    "abstract": "Abstract The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C points to the need for carbon neutrality by mid‐century. Achieving this in the United States in only 30 years will be challenging, and practical pathways detailing the technologies, infrastructure, costs, and tradeoffs involved are needed. Modeling the entire U.S. energy and industrial system with new analysis tools that capture synergies not represented in sector‐specific or integrated assessment models, we created multiple pathways to net zero and net negative CO 2 emissions by 2050. They met all forecast U.S. energy needs at a net cost of 0.2–1.2% of GDP in 2050, using only commercial or near‐commercial technologies, and requiring no early retirement of existing infrastructure. Pathways with constraints on consumer behavior, land use, biomass use, and technology choices (e.g., no nuclear) met the target but at higher cost. All pathways employed four basic strategies: energy efficiency, decarbonized electricity, electrification, and carbon capture. Least‐cost pathways were based on &gt;80% wind and solar electricity plus thermal generation for reliability. A 100% renewable primary energy system was feasible but had higher cost and land use. We found multiple feasible options for supplying low‐carbon fuels for non‐electrifiable end uses in industry, freight, and aviation, which were not required in bulk until after 2035. In the next decade, the actions required in all pathways were similar: expand renewable capacity 3.5 fold, retire coal, maintain existing gas generating capacity, and increase electric vehicle and heat pump sales to &gt;50% of market share. This study provides a playbook for carbon neutrality policy with concrete near‐term priorities.",

    "abstract": "The 2018 drought and heatwave over northern Europe were exceptional, with unprecedented forest fires in Sweden, searing heat in Germany and water restrictions in England. Monthly, daily, and hourly data from ERA5, verified with in situ soil water content and surface flux measurements, are examined to investigate the subseasonal-to-seasonal progression of the event and the diurnal evolution of tropospheric profiles over Britain to quantify the anomalous land surface contribution to heat and drought. Data suggest the region entered an unprecedented condition of becoming a \"hot spot\" for land-atmosphere coupling, which exacerbated the heatwave across much of northern Europe. Land-atmosphere feedbacks were prompted by unusually low soil water over wide areas, which generated moisture limitations on surface latent heat fluxes, suppressing cloud formation, increasing surface net radiation, and driving temperatures higher during several multiweek episodes of extreme heat. We find consistent evidence in field data and reanalysis of a threshold of soil water content at most locations, below which surface fluxes and daily maximum temperatures become hypersensitive to declining soil water. Similar recent heatwaves over various parts of Europe in 2003, 2010, and 2019, combined with dire climate change projections, suggest such events could be on the increase. Land-atmosphere feedbacks may play an increasingly important role in exacerbating extremes, but could also contribute to their predictability on subseasonal time scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ocean has absorbed the equivalent of 39% of industrial‐age fossil carbon emissions, significantly modulating the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 and its associated impacts on climate. Despite the importance of the ocean carbon sink to climate, our understanding of the causes of its interannual‐to‐decadal variability remains limited. This hinders our ability to attribute its past behavior and project its future. A key period of interest is the 1990s, when the ocean carbon sink did not grow as expected. Previous explanations of this behavior have focused on variability internal to the ocean or associated with coupled atmosphere/ocean modes. Here, we use an idealized upper ocean box model to illustrate that two external forcings are sufficient to explain the pattern and magnitude of sink variability since the mid‐1980s. First, the global‐scale reduction in the decadal‐average ocean carbon sink in the 1990s is attributable to the slowed growth rate of atmospheric pCO 2 . The acceleration of atmospheric pCO 2 growth after 2001 drove recovery of the sink. Second, the global sea surface temperature response to the 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo explains the timing of the global sink within the 1990s. These results are consistent with previous experiments using ocean hindcast models with variable atmospheric pCO 2 and with and without climate variability. The fact that variability in the growth rate of atmospheric pCO 2 directly imprints on the ocean sink implies that there will be an immediate reduction in ocean carbon uptake as atmospheric pCO 2 responds to cuts in anthropogenic emissions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Surface temperature is often used to examine heat exposure in multi‐city studies and for informing urban heat mitigation efforts due to scarcity of urban air temperature measurements. Cities also have lower relative humidity, traditionally not accounted for in large‐scale observational urban heat risk assessments. Here, using crowdsourced measurements from over 40,000 weather stations in ≈600 urban clusters in Europe, we show the moderating effect of this urbanization‐induced humidity reduction on outdoor heat stress during the 2019 heatwave. We demonstrate that daytime differences in heat index between urban clusters and their surroundings are weak, and associations of this urban‐rural difference with background climate, generally examined from the surface temperature perspective, are diminished due to moisture feedbacks. We also examine the spatial variability of surface temperature, air temperature, and heat index within these clusters—relevant for detecting hotspots and potential disparities in heat exposure—and find that surface temperature is a poor proxy for the intra‐urban distribution of heat index during daytime. Finally, urban vegetation shows much weaker (∼1/6th as strong) associations with heat index than with surface temperature, which has broad implications for optimizing urban heat stress mitigation strategies. These findings are valid for operational metrics of heat stress for shaded conditions (apparent temperature and humidex), thermodynamic proxies (wet‐bulb temperature), and empirical heat indices. Based on this large‐scale empirical evidence, surface temperature, used due to the lack of better alternatives, may not be suitable for accurately informing heat mitigation strategies within and across cities, necessitating more urban‐scale observations and better urban‐resolving models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The oceanic uptake and resulting storage of the anthropogenic CO 2 (C ant ) that humans have emitted into the atmosphere moderates climate change. Yet our knowledge about how this uptake and storage has progressed in time remained limited. Here, we determine decadal trends in the storage of C ant by applying the eMLR(C*) regression method to ocean interior observations collected repeatedly since the 1990s. We find that the global ocean storage of C ant grew from 1994 to 2004 by 29 ± 3 Pg C dec −1 and from 2004 to 2014 by 27 ± 3 Pg C dec −1 (±1σ). The storage change in the second decade is about 15 ± 11% lower than one would expect from the first decade and assuming proportional increase with atmospheric CO 2 . We attribute this reduction in sensitivity to a decrease of the ocean buffer capacity and changes in ocean circulation. In the Atlantic Ocean, the maximum storage rate shifted from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, plausibly caused by a weaker formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Waters and an intensified ventilation of mode and intermediate waters in the Southern Hemisphere. Our estimates of the C ant accumulation differ from cumulative net air‐sea flux estimates by several Pg C dec −1 , suggesting a substantial and variable, but uncertain net loss of natural carbon from the ocean. Our findings indicate a considerable vulnerability of the ocean carbon sink to climate variability and change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent marine heatwaves in the Gulf of Alaska have had devastating impacts on species from various trophic levels. Due to climate change, total heat exposure in the upper ocean has become longer, more intense, more frequent, and more likely to happen at the same time as other environmental extremes. The combination of multiple environmental extremes can exacerbate the response of sensitive marine organisms. Our hindcast simulation provides the first indication that more than 20% of the bottom water of the Gulf of Alaska continental shelf was exposed to quadruple heat, positive hydrogen ion concentration [H + ], negative aragonite saturation state (Ω arag ), and negative oxygen concentration [O 2 ] compound extreme events during the 2018–2020 marine heat wave. Natural intrusion of deep and acidified water combined with the marine heat wave triggered the first occurrence of these events in 2019. During the 2013–2016 marine heat wave, surface waters were already exposed to widespread marine heat and positive [H + ] compound extreme events due to the temperature effect on the [H + ]. We introduce a new Gulf of Alaska Downwelling Index (GOADI) with short‐term predictive skill, which can serve as indicator of past and near‐future positive [H + ], negative Ω arag , and negative [O 2 ] compound extreme events near the shelf seafloor. Our results suggest that the marine heat waves may have not been the sole environmental stressor that led to the observed ecosystem impacts and warrant a closer look at existing in situ inorganic carbon and other environmental data in combination with biological observations and model output.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The influence of aerosol particles on cloud reflectivity remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. Commercial shipping constitutes a large and concentrated aerosol perturbation in a meteorological regime where clouds have a disproportionally large effect on climate. Yet, to date, studies have been unable to detect climatologically relevant cloud radiative effects from shipping, despite models indicating that the cloud response should produce a sizable negative radiative forcing (perturbation to Earth's energy balance). We attribute a significant increase in cloud reflectivity to enhanced cloud droplet number concentrations within a major shipping corridor in the southeast Atlantic. Prevailing winds constrain emissions around the corridor, which cuts through a climatically important region of expansive low cloud cover. We use universal kriging, a classic geostatistical method, to estimate what cloud properties would have been in the absence of shipping. In the morning, cloud brightening is consistent with changes in microphysics alone, whereas in the afternoon, increases in cloud brightness from microphysical changes are offset by decreases in the total amount of cloud water. We calculate an effective radiative forcing within the southeast Atlantic shipping corridor of approximately −2 W/m 2 . Several years of data are required to identify a clear signal. Extrapolating our results globally, we calculate an effective radiative forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions in low clouds of −1.0 W/m 2 (95% confidence interval: −1.6 to −0.4 W/m 2 ). The unique setup in the southeast Atlantic could be an ideal test for the representation of aerosol‐cloud interactions in climate models.",

Increasing losses were associated with increased decomposition and corroborated by measures of declining peat elevation. Effects of eCO 2 were minor. Results indicate a range of C losses from boreal peatlands 4.5 to 18 times faster than historical rates of accumulation, with substantial emissions of CO 2 and CH 4 to the atmosphere. A model of peatland C cycle captured the temperature response dominated by peat decomposition under ambient CO 2 , but improvements will be needed to predict the lack of observable responses to elevated CO 2 concentrations thus far.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Satellite remote sensing observations show an increased greenness trend over land in recent decades. While greenness observations can indicate increased productivity, estimation of total annual productivity is highly dependent on vegetation response to climate and environmental conditions. Models have been struggling to determine how much carbon is taken up by plants as a result of increased atmospheric CO 2 fertilization. Current remote sensing light use efficiency (LUE) models contain considerable uncertainty due to the lack of spatial and temporal variability in maximum LUE parameter and climate sensitivity defined for global plant functional types (PFTs). We used the optimum LUE (LUE opt ) previously derived from the global FLUXNET network to improve estimation of global gross primary productivity (GPP) for the period 1982–2016. Our results indicate increasing GPP in northern latitudes owing to reduced cold temperature constraints on plant growth, thereby suggesting increasing negative carbon‐climate feedback in high latitudes. In the tropics, by contrast, our results indicate an emerging positive climate feedback, mainly due to increasing atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Further pervasive VPD increase is likely to continue to reduce global GPP and amplify carbon emissions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Much of the Southern Ocean surface south of 55° S cooled and freshened between at least the early 1980s and the early 2010s. Many processes have been proposed to explain the unexpected cooling, including increased winds or freshwater fluxes. However, these mechanisms so far failed to fully explain the surface trends and the concurrent subsurface warming (100 to 500 m). Here, we argue that these trends are predominantly caused by an increased wind‐driven northward sea‐ice transport, enhancing the extraction of freshwater near Antarctica and releasing it in the open ocean. This conclusion is based on factorial experiments with a regional ocean model. In all experiments with an enhanced northward sea‐ice transport, a strengthened salinity‐dominated stratification cools the open‐ocean surface waters between the Subantarctic Front and the sea‐ice edge. The strengthened stratification reduces the downward mixing of cold surface water and the upward heat loss of the warmer waters below, thus warming the subsurface. This sea‐ice induced subsurface warming mostly occurs around West Antarctica, where it likely enhances ice‐shelf melting. Moreover, the subsurface warming could account for about 8 ± 2% of the global ocean heat content increase between 1982 and 2011. Antarctic sea‐ice changes thereby may have contributed to the slowdown of global surface warming over this period. Our conclusions are robust across all considered sensitivity cases, although the trend magnitude is sensitive to forcing uncertainties and the model's mean state. It remains unclear whether these sea‐ice induced changes are associated with natural variability or reflect a response to anthropogenic forcing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 2019 was the hottest and driest year on record for southeast Australia leading to bushfires of unprecedented extent. Ecosystem carbon losses due to drought and fire are believed to have been substantial, but have not been well quantified. Here, we utilize space‐based measurements of trace gases (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument X CO , Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 ) and up‐scaled GPP (FluxSat GPP) to quantify the carbon cycle anomalies resulting from drought and fire in southeast Australia during the 2019–2020 growing season. We find that biomass burning released 113–236 TgC of CO 2 while drought and fire‐induced anomalies in net ecosystem exchange reduced growing season carbon uptake by an additional 19–52 TgC of CO 2 . These carbon losses were concentrated during the spring and early summer, when hot‐dry conditions were most severe. A shift to cooler conditions with above average rainfall during February is found to result in a partial recovery and greening in unburned ecosystems, but not in fire‐impacted areas. The net 2019–2020 carbon loss substantially exceeded interannual variations in net uptake over 2010–2019 estimated from top‐down constraints (∼5 σ anomaly), and exceeded Australia's annual fossil fuel emissions (∼104 TgC year −1 ). Top‐down constraints show that the regional carbon budget is strongly regulated by climate variability, and suggest that cool‐wet conditions are required for a rapid recovery of carbon stocks. This has implications for the regional carbon budget as more frequent climate‐change‐driven heat and drought events may increase the frequency of fire events and the recovery time of ecosystems, threatening the carbon stocks of the region.",

Here we use state‐of‐the‐art remote sensing data from 145 city clusters to disentangle the drivers of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) intensity and quantify urban‐rural differences in vegetation cover, species composition, and evaporative cooling. We show that nighttime SUHIs are affected mostly by abiotic factors, while daytime SUHIs are highly correlated with vegetation characteristics and the wetness of the background climate. Magnitude and seasonality of daytime SUHIs are controlled by urban‐rural differences in plant transpiration and leaf area, which explain the dependence of SUHIs on wetness conditions. Leaf area differences are caused primarily by changes in vegetation type and a loss of in‐city forested areas, highlighting the importance of maintaining “natural reserves” as a sustainable heat mitigation policy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wetland methane (CH 4 ) emissions comprise about one‐third of the global CH 4 source. The latitudinal distribution and climate sensitivity of wetland CH 4 fluxes are the key determinants of the global CH 4 ‐climate feedback. However, large differences exist between bottom‐up estimates, informed by ground‐based flux measurements, and top‐down estimates derived from spaceborne total column CH 4 . Despite the extensive coverage of satellite CH 4 concentration observations, challenges remain with using top‐down estimates to test bottom‐up models, mainly because of the uncertainties in the satellite retrievals, the model representation errors, the variable prior emissions, and the confounding role of the posterior error covariance structures. Here, we use satellite‐based top‐down CH 4 flux estimates (2010–2012) to test and refine 42 bottom‐up estimates of wetland emissions that use a range of hypothesized wetland extents and process controls. Our comparison between bottom‐up models and satellite‐based fluxes innovatively accounts for cross‐correlations and spatial uncertainties typically found in top‐down inverse estimates, such that only the information from satellite observations and the atmospheric transport model is kept as a constraint. We present a satellite‐constrained wetland CH 4 ensemble product derived from assembling the highest‐performance bottom‐up models, which estimates global wetland CH 4 emissions of 148 (117–189, 5th–95th percentile) Tg CH 4 yr −1 . We find that tropical wetland emissions contribute 72% (63%–85%) to the global wetland total. We also find that a lower‐than‐expected temperature sensitivity agrees better with atmospheric CH 4 measurements. Overall, our approach demonstrates the potential for using satellites to quantitatively refine bottom‐up wetland CH 4 emission estimates, their latitudinal distributions, and their sensitivity to climate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rapid seismic deployments after major earthquakes often produce critical data for characterizing postseismic processes. Taking advantage of pre‐existing optical fibers, the recently emerging distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology can quickly establish ultra‐dense seismic arrays after the mainshocks. Here we present the first example of such a rapid‐response experiment using four telecommunication fiber optic cables near the 2019 M 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake in California. By applying template matching to the Ridgecrest DAS array, we detected 6 times more aftershocks than the standard catalog within the three‐month period. The enhanced catalog reveals abundant aftershocks on multiple crosscutting faults near the epicenters of the mainshock and the M 6.4 foreshock. Given the widespread fiber optic networks around the world, DAS has the potential to deliver fast and high‐resolution aftershock monitoring and promote better understanding of earthquake physics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The livestock sector is the largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions and is projected to increase in the future with the increased demand for livestock products. Here, we compare livestock methane emissions and emission intensities, defined by the amount of methane emitted per unit of animal proteins, estimated by different methodologies, and identify mitigation potentials in different regions of the world based on possible future projections. We show that emission intensity decreased for most livestock categories globally during 2000–2018, due to an increasing protein‐production efficiency, and the IPCC Tier 2 method should be used for capturing the temporal changes in the emission intensities. We further show that efforts on the demand‐side to promote balanced, healthy, and environmentally sustainable diets in most countries will not be sufficient to mitigate livestock methane emissions without parallel efforts to improve production efficiency. The latter efforts have much greater mitigating effects than demand‐side efforts, and hence should be prioritized in a few developing countries that contribute most of the mitigation potential.",

We examine the change in the Pacific OMZ volume in an ensemble of ESMs from the CMIP6 archive, considering a broad range of oxygen (O 2 ) thresholds relevant to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems (5–160 µmol/kg). Despite OMZ biases in the historical period of the simulations, the ESM ensemble projections consistently fall into three regimes across ESMs: an expansion of low oxygenated waters (+0.8 [0.6, 1.0] × 10 16 m 3 /century for O 2 ≤ 120 µmol/kg, ESM median and interquartile range); a slight contraction of the OMZ core although more uncertain across ESMs (−0.1 [−0.5, 0.0] × 10 16 m 3 /century for O 2 ≤ 20 µmol/kg); and at the transition from contraction to expansion regimes, a spatial redistribution but near‐zero change in the volume of hypoxic waters (0.0 [−0.3, +0.1] × 10 16 m 3 /century for O 2 ≤ 60 µmol/kg). Changes in circulation and biology dictate the shift from expansion to contraction. Specifically, reduced subtropical ventilation controls the expansion of low oxygenated waters, while a combination of circulation and biological changes explains the contraction of the core (likely changes in mixing, reduced intermediate ventilation and oxygen demand). Increased model complexity (e.g., ecosystem dynamics and equatorial circulation) likely stabilize the OMZ response, suggesting that future changes might lie in the lower bound of current projections. The expansion of low oxygenated waters which delimit the optimum habitat of numerous marine species would severely impact ecosystems and ecosystem services.",

Global inventories, such as the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, have latencies of 12–24 months and may not keep pace with rapidly changing infrastructure, particularly in the developing world. Our work reveals that airborne and satellite imaging spectrometers provide 3–30 m spatial resolution and accurate quantification of CO 2 emissions at the facility scale. Examples from 17 coal and gas fired power plants across the United States demonstrate robust correlation and 21% agreement on average between our remotely sensed estimates and simultaneous in situ measured emissions. We highlight four examples of coal‐fired power plants in India, Poland, and South Korea, where we quantify significant carbon dioxide emissions from power plants where limited public emissions data exist. Leveraging previous work on methane (CH 4 ) plume detection, we present a strategy to exploit joint CO 2 and CH 4 plume imaging to quantify carbon emissions across widely distributed industrial infrastructure, including facilities that co‐emit CO 2 and CH 4 . We show an example of a coal operation, where we attribute 25% of greenhouse gas emissions to coal extraction (CH 4 ) and the remaining 75% to energy generation (CO 2 ). Satellite spectrometers could track high emitting coal‐fired power plants that collectively contribute to 60% or more of global coal CO 2 emissions. Multiple revisits and coordinated targeting of these high emitting facilities by multiple spaceborne instruments will be key to reducing uncertainties in global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions and supporting emissions mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "This study quantifies the association between the COVID-19 economic downturn and 2020 tropospheric ozone anomalies above Europe and western North America, and their impact on long-term trends. Anomaly detection for an atmospheric time series is usually carried out by identifying potentially aberrant data points relative to climatological values. However, detecting ozone anomalies from sparsely sampled ozonesonde profiles (once per week at most sites) is challenging due to ozone's high temporal variability. We first demonstrate the challenges for summarizing regional trends based on independent time series from multiple nearby ozone profiling stations. We then propose a novel regional-scale anomaly detection framework based on generalized additive mixed models, which accounts for the sampling frequency and inherent data uncertainty associated with each vertical profile data set, measured by ozonesondes, lidar or commercial aircraft. This method produces a long-term monthly time series with high vertical resolution that reports ozone anomalies from the surface to the middle-stratosphere under a unified framework, which can be used to quantify the regional-scale ozone anomalies during the COVID-19 economic downturn. By incorporating extensive commercial aircraft data and frequently sampled ozonesonde profiles above Europe, we show that the complex interannual variability of ozone can be adequately captured by our modeling approach. The results show that free tropospheric ozone negative anomalies in 2020 are the most profound since the benchmark year of 1994 for both Europe and western North America, and positive trends over 1994-2019 are diminished in both regions by the 2020 anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Satellite observations of snow‐covered regions in the microwave range have the potential to retrieve essential climate variables such as snow height. This requires a precise understanding of how microwave scattering is linked to snow microstructural properties (density, grain size, grain shape and arrangement). This link has so far relied on empirical adjustments of the theories, precluding the development of robust retrieval algorithms. Here we solve this problem by introducing a new microstructural parameter able to consistently predict scattering. This “microwave grain size” is demonstrated to be proportional to the measurable optical grain size and to a new factor describing the chord length dispersion in the microstructure, a geometrical property known as polydispersity. By assuming that the polydispersity depends on the snow grain type only, we retrieve its value for rounded and faceted grains by optimization of microwave satellite observations in 18 Antarctic sites, and for depth hoar in 86 Canadian sites using ground‐based observations. The value for the convex grains (0.6) compares favorably to the polydispersity calculated from 3D micro‐computed tomography images for alpine grains, while values for depth hoar show wider variations (1.2–1.9) and are larger in Canada than in the Alps. Nevertheless, using one value for each grain type, the microwave observations in Antarctica and in Canada can be simulated from in‐situ measurements with good accuracy with a fully physical model. These findings improve snow scattering modeling, enabling future more accurate uses of satellite observations in snow hydrological and meteorological applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wetlands are responsible for 20%–31% of global methane (CH 4 ) emissions and account for a large source of uncertainty in the global CH 4 budget. Data‐driven upscaling of CH 4 fluxes from eddy covariance measurements can provide new and independent bottom‐up estimates of wetland CH 4 emissions. Here, we develop a six‐predictor random forest upscaling model (UpCH4), trained on 119 site‐years of eddy covariance CH 4 flux data from 43 freshwater wetland sites in the FLUXNET‐CH4 Community Product. Network patterns in site‐level annual means and mean seasonal cycles of CH 4 fluxes were reproduced accurately in tundra, boreal, and temperate regions (Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency ∼0.52–0.63 and 0.53). UpCH4 estimated annual global wetland CH 4 emissions of 146 ± 43 TgCH 4 y −1 for 2001–2018 which agrees closely with current bottom‐up land surface models (102–181 TgCH 4 y −1 ) and overlaps with top‐down atmospheric inversion models (155–200 TgCH 4 y −1 ). However, UpCH4 diverged from both types of models in the spatial pattern and seasonal dynamics of tropical wetland emissions. We conclude that upscaling of eddy covariance CH 4 fluxes has the potential to produce realistic extra‐tropical wetland CH 4 emissions estimates which will improve with more flux data. To reduce uncertainty in upscaled estimates, researchers could prioritize new wetland flux sites along humid‐to‐arid tropical climate gradients, from major rainforest basins (Congo, Amazon, and SE Asia), into monsoon (Bangladesh and India) and savannah regions (African Sahel) and be paired with improved knowledge of wetland extent seasonal dynamics in these regions. The monthly wetland methane products gridded at 0.25° from UpCH4 are available via ORNL DAAC ( https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2253 ).",

All samples contain aqueously precipitated materials and most or all were aqueously deposited. Although the rover instruments have not confidently detected organic matter in the rocks from the fan front, the much more sensitive terrestrial instruments will still be able to search for remnants of prebiotic chemistries and past life, and study Mars's past habitability in the samples returned to Earth. The hydrated, sulfate-bearing mudstone has the highest potential to preserve organic matter and biosignatures, whereas the carbonate-bearing sandstones can be used to constrain when and for how long Jezero crater contained liquid water. Returned sample science analyses of sulfate, carbonate, clay, phosphate and igneous minerals as well as trace metals and volatiles that are present in the samples acquired at the fan front would provide transformative insights into past habitable environments on Mars, the evolution of its magnetic field, atmosphere and climate and the past and present cycling of atmospheric and crustal water, sulfur and carbon.",

The 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo earthquake ruptured the east‐growing end of the slow‐moving (∼1 mm/yr) Jiangcuo fault in north Tibet, providing an opportunity to examine the relation between rupture characteristics and fault structure. Here we combine field and multiple remote sensing techniques to map the surface rupture at cm‐resolution and document comprehensively on‐fault offsets and off‐fault deformation. The 158 km‐long surface rupture consists of misoriented structurally inherited N110°‐striking segments and younger optimally oriented N093°‐striking segments, relative to the regional stress field. Despite being comparatively newly formed, the ∼N093°‐striking fault segments accommodate more localized strain, with up to 3 m on‐fault left‐lateral slip and 25%–50% off‐fault deformation, and possibly faster rupture speed. These results are in contrast with previous findings showing more localized strain and faster rupture speed on more mature fault segments; instead, our observations suggest that fault orientation with respect to the regional stress can exert a more important control than fault maturity on coseismic rupture behavior when both factors are at play.",

Over these years, ground‐based observational capabilities have been significantly enhanced to monitor the ionospheric weather. Notably, the newly established Sanya incoherent scatter radar (SYISR) (Yue, Wan, Ning, &amp; Jin, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550‐022‐01684‐1 ), one of the critical infrastructures of the Chinese “Meridian Project,” provides multiple parameter measurements in the upper atmosphere at low latitudes over Asian longitudies. Unique ionospheric changes on superstorm day 11 May were first recorded by the SYISR experiments and the geostationary satellite (GEO) total electron content (TEC) network over the Asian sector. The electron density or TEC displayed wavelike structures rather than a regular diurnal pattern. Surprisingly, two humps, a common feature in the daytime equatorial ionization anomaly structure, disappeared. The SYISR observations revealed that multiple wind surges accompanied the downward phase propagation caused by atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) originating from auroral zones. Meanwhile, strong upward and large downward drifts were respectively observed in the daytime and around sunset. The Thermosphere‐Ionosphere Electrodynamics Global Circulation Model (TIEGCM) simulations demonstrated that abnormal ionospheric changes were attributed to meridional wind disturbances associated with AGWs and recurrent penetration electric fields corresponding to larger B z southward excursions and disturbance dynamo. The complicated interplay between AGWs and disturbance electric fields contributed to this unique ionospheric variation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While large‐scale floods directly impact human lives and infrastructures, they also profoundly impact agricultural productivity. New satellite observations of vegetation activity and atmospheric CO 2 offer the opportunity to quantify the effects of such extreme events on cropland carbon sequestration. Widespread flooding during spring and early summer 2019 induced conditions that delayed crop planting across the U.S. Midwest. As a result, satellite observations of solar‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument and Orbiting Carbon Observatory reveal a 16‐day shift in the seasonal cycle of photosynthesis relative to 2018, along with a 15% lower peak value. We estimate a reduction of 0.21 PgC in cropland gross primary productivity in June and July, partially compensated in August and September (+0.14 PgC). The extension of the 2019 growing season into late September is likely to have benefited from increased water availability and late‐season temperature. Ultimately, this change is predicted to reduce the crop productivity in the Midwest Corn/Soy belt by ~15% compared to 2018. Using an atmospheric transport model, we show that a decline of ~0.1 PgC in the net carbon uptake during June and July is consistent with observed CO 2 enhancements of up to 10 ppm in the midday boundary layer from Atmospheric Carbon and Transport‐America aircraft and over 3 ppm in column‐averaged dry‐air mole fractions from Orbiting Carbon Observatory. This study quantifies the impact of floods on cropland productivity and demonstrates the potential of combining solar‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence with atmospheric CO 2 observations to monitor regional carbon flux anomalies.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the observed monthly deseasonalized and detrended variability of the tropical radiation budget and suggests that variations of the lower‐tropospheric stability and of the spatial organization of deep convection both strongly contribute to this variability. Satellite observations show that on average over the tropical belt, when deep convection is more aggregated, the free troposphere is drier, the deep convective cloud coverage is less extensive, and the emission of heat to space is increased; an enhanced aggregation of deep convection is thus associated with a radiative cooling of the tropics. An increase of the tropical‐mean lower‐tropospheric stability is also coincident with a radiative cooling of the tropics, primarily because it is associated with more marine low clouds and an enhanced reflection of solar radiation, although the free‐tropospheric drying also contributes to the cooling. The contributions of convective aggregation and lower‐tropospheric stability to the modulation of the radiation budget are complementary, largely independent of each other, and equally strong. Together, they account for more than sixty percent of the variance of the tropical radiation budget. Satellite observations are thus consistent with the suggestion from modeling studies that the spatial organization of deep convection substantially influences the radiative balance of the Earth. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors that control convective organization and lower‐tropospheric stability variations, and the need to monitor their changes as the climate warms.",

An appreciation of the mantle water storage capacity is indispensable to our understanding of how water may have cycled between the surface and mantle reservoirs and changed the volume of the oceans through time. In this study, we parameterized high pressure‐temperature experimental data on water storage capacities in major rock‐forming minerals to track the bulk water storage capacity in Earth's solid mantle as a function of temperature. We find that the mantle water storage capacity decreases as mantle potential temperature ( T p ) increases, and its estimated value depends on the water storage capacity of bridgmanite in the lower mantle: 1.86–4.41 OM with a median of 2.29 OM for today ( T p = 1600 K), and 0.52–1.69 OM with a median of 0.72 OM for the early Earth's solid mantle (for a T p that was 300 K higher). An increase in T p by 200–300 K results in a decrease in the mantle water storage capacity by – OM. We explored how the volume of early oceans may have controlled sea level during the early Archean (4–3.2 Ga) with some additional assumptions about early continents.

    "abstract": "Abstract The nature and cause of deep earthquakes remain enduring unknowns in the field of seismology. We present new models of thermal structures of subducted slabs traced to mantle transition zone depths that permit a detailed comparison between slab pressure/temperature ( P/T ) paths and hydrated/carbonated mineral phase relations. We find a remarkable correlation between slabs capable of transporting water to transition zone depths in dense hydrous magnesium silicates with slabs that produce seismicity below ∼300‐km depth, primarily between 500 and 700 km. This depth range also coincides with the P/T conditions at which oceanic crustal lithologies in cold slabs are predicted to intersect the carbonate‐bearing basalt solidus to produce carbonatitic melts. Both forms of fluid evolution are well represented by sublithospheric diamonds whose inclusions record the existence of melts, fluids, or supercritical liquids derived from hydrated or carbonate‐bearing slabs at depths (∼300–700 km) generally coincident with deep‐focus earthquakes. We propose that the hydrous and carbonated fluids released from subducted slabs at these depths lead to fluid‐triggered seismicity, fluid migration, diamond precipitation, and inclusion crystallization. Deep focus earthquake hypocenters could track the general region of deep fluid release, migration, and diamond formation in the mantle. The thermal modeling of slabs in the mantle and the correlation between sublithospheric diamonds, deep focus earthquakes, and slabs at depth demonstrate a deep subduction pathway to the mantle transition zone for carbon and volatiles that bypasses shallower decarbonation and dehydration processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although there is little doubt that rivers once flowed on Mars' surface, how sustained and frequent their flows were remains enigmatic. Understanding the hydrology of early Mars, nonetheless, is a prerequisite to resolving the planet's climate history and the astrobiological potential of various ancient putative ecosystems. In 2021, NASA's Perseverance rover will attempt to land near ancient fluviodeltaic deposits in Jezero crater. Deltas offer enhanced organic‐matter burial and preservation on Earth but translating this notion to early Martian environments remains speculative in the absence of information on flow intermittency and sedimentation rates. Here we develop a new model to infer the lateral migration rate of Martian river meanders, which, combined with orbiter‐based observations of the fluviodeltaic deposits at Jezero crater, allows us to determine a minimum timescale for the formation of its delta. We then independently constrain the total duration of delta formation, including dry spells. Our best estimates suggest that delta formation spanned ~19–37 years over a total duration of ~380,000 years, i.e., that rivers flowed for a minimum ~1 sol/15–30 Martian years and conceivably more frequently, but uncertainties on total duration are large. Despite a possibly arid climate, predicted sedimentation rates are high, suggesting a rapid burial of putative organics in distal deposits. Altogether, our results support Jezero crater's potential as a prime target to look for ancient Martian life and acquire samples to return to Earth. Any discrepancies between our predictions of the deposits' grain‐to‐bedform‐scale architecture and future rover observations will shed critical light onto Mars' early surface environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inequalities persist in the geosciences. White women and people of color remain under‐represented at all levels of academic faculty, including positions of power such as departmental and institutional leadership. While the proportion of women among geoscience faculty has been cataloged previously, new programs and initiatives aimed at improving diversity, focused on institutional factors that affect equity in the geosciences, necessitate an updated study and a new metric for quantifying the biases that result in under‐representation. We compile a data set of 2,531 tenured and tenure‐track geoscience faculty from 62 universities in the United States to evaluate the proportion of women by rank and discipline. We find that 27% of faculty are women. The fraction of women in the faculty pool decreases with rank, as women comprise 46% of assistant professors, 34% of associate professors, and 19% of full professors. We quantify the attrition of women in terms of a fractionation factor, which describes the rate of loss of women along the tenure track and allows us to move away from the metaphor of the “leaky pipeline.” Efforts to address inequities in institutional culture and biases in promotion and hiring practices over the past few years may provide insight into the recent positive shifts in fractionation factor. Our results suggest a need for 1:1 hiring between men and women to reach gender parity. Due to significant disparities in race, this work is most applicable to white women, and our use of the gender binary does not represent gender diversity in the geosciences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Through the release of groundwater, most mountain rivers run year‐round despite their small catchments and sporadic precipitation. This makes mountain ranges important sources of reliable freshwater for downstream populations in many parts of the world. However, due to a lack of ground instrumentation, little is known about groundwater dynamics in mountainous landscapes. Recent research has shown that the amount of moisture trapped in the soil and weathered rocks in the vadose zone can significantly buffer groundwater recharge and runoff but the wider recognition of this effect on major mountain systems has not been yet established. In this study, we test whether the moisture reservoir has an impact on hydrological fluxes in a steep Himalayan catchment during three monsoon seasons. We measured an array of parameters including relative seismic velocity changes from ambient noise correlations. This noninvasive technique allows us to monitor groundwater dynamics in conjunction with classical hydrological measurements. We found that the moisture saturation in the vadose zone controls the onset of groundwater recharge and runoff and therefore determines the annual water availability supplied by monsoon precipitation. We model this dynamic using a surface layer that has a finite storage capacity that controls the connectivity of surface flux to groundwater. The extension of this concept, which is thought to apply widely in flat and undulating landscapes, to steep mountain topography with thin and discontinuous soils underlain by regolith and bedrock has important implications for mountain hydrology.",

We simulated climate impacts of US-Russia and India-Pakistan nuclear wars in an Earth System Model, here, we report on the ocean impacts. Like volcanic eruptions and large forest fires, firestorms from nuclear war would transport light-blocking aerosols to the stratosphere, resulting in global cooling. The ocean responds over two timescales: a rapid cooling event and a long recovery, indicating a hysteresis response of the ocean to global cooling. Surface cooling drives sea ice expansion, enhanced meridional overturning, and intensified ocean vertical mixing that is expanded, deeper, and longer lasting. Phytoplankton production and community structure are highly modified by perturbations to light, temperature, and nutrients, resulting in initial decimation of production, especially at high latitudes. A new physical and biogeochemical ocean state results, characterized by shallower pycnoclines, thermoclines, and nutriclines, ventilated deep water masses, and thicker Arctic sea ice. Persistent changes in nutrient limitation drive a shift in phytoplankton community structure, resulting in increased diatom populations, which in turn increase iron scavenging and iron limitation, especially at high latitudes. In the largest US-Russia scenario (150 Tg), ocean recovery is likely on the order of decades at the surface and hundreds of years at depth, while changes to Arctic sea-ice will likely last thousands of years, effectively a \"Nuclear Little Ice Age.\" Marine ecosystems would be highly disrupted by both the initial perturbation and in the new ocean state, resulting in long-term, global impacts to ecosystem services such as fisheries.",

While some hypotheses suggest that plate tectonics began in the Hadean, others suggest that the Hadean was characterized by long‐lived protocrust and an absence of significant plate tectonic processes. Recently proposed trace‐element proxies for the tectono‐magmatic settings in which zircons formed are a relatively novel tool to understand crustal processes in the past. Here, we present high‐spatial resolution zircon trace and rare earth element geochemical data along with Hf and O isotope data of a new location with Hadean materials, 4.1–3.3 Ga detrital zircons from the 3.31 Ga Green Sandstone Bed, Barberton Greenstone Belt. Together, the hafnium isotope and trace element geochemistry of the detrital zircons record a major transition in crustal processes. Zircons older than 3.8 Ga show evidence for isolated, long‐lived protocrust derived by reworking of relatively undepleted mantle sources with limited remelting of surface‐altered material. After 3.8 Ga, Hf isotopic evidence for this protocrust is muted while relatively juvenile source components for the zircon's parental magmas and flux‐like melting signatures become more prominent. This shift mirrors changes in Hf isotopes and trace element geochemistry in other Archean terranes between ∼3.8 and 3.6 Ga and supports the notion that the global onset of pervasive crustal instability and recycling—A possible sign for mobile‐lid tectonics—Occurred in that time period.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar eruptions cause geomagnetic storms in the near‐Earth environment, creating spectacular aurorae visible to the human eye and invisible dynamic changes permeating all of geospace. Just equatorward of the aurora, radars and satellites often observe intense westward plasma flows called subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) in the dusk‐to‐midnight ionosphere. SAPS occur across a narrow latitudinal range and lead to intense frictional heating of the ionospheric plasma and atmospheric neutral gas. SAPS also generate small‐scale plasma waves and density irregularities that interfere with radio communications. As opposed to the commonly observed duskside SAPS, intense eastward subauroral plasma flows in the morning sector were recently discovered to have occurred during a super storm on 20 November 2003. However, the origin of these flows termed “dawnside SAPS” could not be explained by the same mechanism that causes SAPS on the duskside and has remained a mystery. Through real‐event global geospace simulations, here we demonstrate that dawnside SAPS can only occur during major storm conditions. During these times, the magnetospheric plasma convection is so strong as to effectively transport ions to the dawnside, whereas they are typically deflected to the dusk by the energy‐dependent drifts. Ring current pressure then builds up on the dawnside and drives field‐aligned currents that connect to the subauroral ionosphere, where eastward SAPS are generated. The origin of dawnside SAPS explicated in this study advances our understanding of how the geospace system responds to strongly disturbed solar wind driving conditions that can have severe detrimental impacts on human society and infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The shift from denser forests to open, grass‐dominated vegetation in west‐central North America between 26 and 15 million years ago is a major ecological transition with no clear driving force. This open habitat transition (OHT) is considered by some to be evidence for drier summers, more seasonal precipitation, or a cooler climate, but others have proposed that wetter conditions and/or warming initiated the OHT. Here, we use published ( n = 2,065) and new ( n = 173) oxygen isotope measurements ( δ 18 O ) in authigenic clays and soil carbonates to test the hypothesis that the OHT is linked to increasing wintertime aridity. Oxygen isotope ratios in meteoric water ( δ 18 O p ) vary seasonally, and clays and carbonates often form at different times of the year. Therefore, a change in precipitation seasonality can be recorded differently in each mineral. We find that oxygen isotope ratios of clay minerals increase across the OHT while carbonate oxygen isotope ratios show no change or decrease. This result cannot be explained solely by changes in global temperature or a shift to drier summers. Instead, it is consistent with a decrease in winter precipitation that increases annual mean δ 18 O p (and clay δ 18 O ) but has a smaller or negligible effect on soil carbonates that primarily form in warmer months. We suggest that forest communities in west‐central North America were adapted to a wet‐winter precipitation regime for most of the Cenozoic, and they subsequently struggled to meet water demands when winters became drier, resulting in the observed open habitat expansion.",

Understanding these threats requires accurate information on vegetation dynamics and their drivers, which is currently lacking in many regions experiencing rapid climate change such as California. To address this, we combined remote sensing observations with geospatial databases to develop annual maps of vegetation cover (tree, shrub, and herbaceous) and disturbance type (fire, harvest, and forest die-off) in California at 30 m resolution from 1985 to 2021. Considering both changes in cover fraction and areal extent, California lost 4,566 km2 of its tree cover area (6.7% relative to initial cover) since 1985. Substantial gains in tree cover area during the 1990s were more than offset by fire-driven declines since 2000, resulting in greater shrub and herbaceous cover area. Tree cover loss occurred in all ecoregions but was most severe in the southern mountains, where losses from wildfire were not compensated by regrowth in undisturbed areas. Fires and tree cover area loss generally occurred where summer temperatures were greater than 17.5°C, whereas net tree cover gain often occurred in cooler areas, suggesting that ongoing climate warming is threatening forests in many areas. California's vegetation is undergoing rapid transformation, with disturbance rates and climate change posing substantial potential risks to the integrity of California's terrestrial carbon sink.",

However, the complex frictional behavior of natural and synthetic gouges in laboratory experiments eludes explanations. Here, we present a constitutive framework that elucidates the rate, state, and temperature dependence of fault friction under the relevant sliding velocities and temperatures of the brittle lithosphere during seismic cycles. The competition between healing mechanisms, such as viscoelastic collapse, pressure‐solution creep, and crack sealing, explains the low‐temperature stability transition from steady‐state velocity‐strengthening to velocity‐weakening as a function of slip‐rate and temperature. In addition, capturing the transition from cataclastic flow to semi‐brittle creep accounts for the stabilization of fault slip at elevated temperatures. We calibrate the model using extensive laboratory data on synthetic albite and granite gouge, and on natural samples from the Alpine Fault and the Mugi Mélange in the Shimanto accretionary complex in Japan. The constitutive model consistently explains the evolving frictional response of fault gouge from room temperature to 600°C for sliding velocities ranging from nanometers to millimeters per second. The frictional response of faults can be uniquely determined by the in situ lithology and the prevailing hydrothermal conditions.",

Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models, which seek to match patterns of land surface displacement and RSL change, typically employ a linear Maxwell viscoelastic model for the Earth's mantle. In Greenland, however, upper mantle viscosities inferred from ice load changes and other geophysical phenomena occurring over a range of timescales vary by up to two orders of magnitude. Here, we use full‐spectrum rheological models to examine the influence of transient deformation within the Greenland upper mantle, which may account for these differing viscosity estimates. We use observations of shear wave velocity combined with constitutive rheological models to self‐consistently calculate mechanical properties including the apparent upper mantle viscosity and lithosphere thickness across a broad spectrum of frequencies. We find that the contribution of transient behavior is most significant over loading timescales of 10 2 –10 3 years, which corresponds to the timeframe of ice mass loss over recent centuries. Predicted apparent lithosphere thicknesses are also in good agreement with inferences made across seismic, GIA, and flexural timescales. Our results indicate that full‐spectrum constitutive models that more fully capture broadband mantle relaxation provide a means of reconciling seemingly contradictory estimates of Greenland's upper mantle viscosity and lithosphere thickness made from observations spanning a range of timescales.",

However, the availability of hyperspectral observations now allows for a more direct retrieval of ecological parameters and reduction of uncertainty in surface reflectance. To investigate sensitivity and quantify biases of incorporating hyperspectral albedo information into ESMs, we examine how shortwave soil albedo affects surface radiative forcing and simulations of the carbon and water cycles. Results reveal that the use of two broadband values to represent soil albedo can introduce systematic radiative‐forcing differences compared to a hyperspectral representation. Specifically, we estimate soil albedo biases of ±0.2 over desert areas, which can result in spectrally integrated radiative forcing divergences of up to 30 W m −2 , primarily due to discrepancies in the blue (404–504 nm) and far‐red (702–747 nm) regions. Furthermore, coupled land‐atmosphere simulations indicate a significant difference in net solar flux at the top of the atmosphere (&gt;3.3 W m −2 ), which can impact global energy fluxes, rainfall, temperature, and photosynthesis. Finally, simulations show that considering the hyperspectrally resolved soil reflectance leads to increased maximum daily temperatures under current and future CO 2 concentrations.",

Records of grounding line retreat from the geologic past offer an opportunity to extend our observations of these processes beyond the modern record and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of ice‐sheet change. Here, we present constraints on the timing and inland extent of deglacial grounding line retreat in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica, obtained via direct sampling of a subglacial lake located 150 km inland from the modern grounding line and beneath &gt;1 km of ice. Isotopic measurements of water and sediment from the lake enabled us to evaluate how the subglacial microbial community accessed radiocarbon‐bearing organic carbon for energy, as well as where it transferred carbon metabolically. Using radiocarbon as a natural tracer, we found that sedimentary organic carbon was microbially translocated to dissolved carbon pools in the subglacial hydrologic system during the 4.5‐year period of water accumulation prior to our sampling. This finding indicates that the grounding line along the Siple Coast of West Antarctica retreated more than 250 km inland during the mid‐Holocene (6.3 ± 1.0 ka), prior to re‐advancing to its modern position.",

While vegetation typically reduces stomatal conductance during drought, accurately modeling how and to what degree stomata respond to changes in moisture availability at global scales is particularly challenging, because no global scale g c observations exist. Here, we leverage a collection of satellite, reanalysis and station‐based near‐surface air and surface temperature estimates, which are physically and statistically linked to due to the local cooling effect of g c through transpiration, to develop a novel emergent constraint of in an ensemble of Earth System Models (ESMs). We find that ESMs systematically underestimate by ∼33%, particularly in grasslands, croplands, and savannas in semi‐arid and bordering regions of the Central United States, Central Europe, Southeastern South America, Southern Africa, Eastern Australia, and parts of East Asia. We show that this underestimation occurs because ESMs inadequately reduce g c when soil moisture decreases. As g c controls carbon, water and energy fluxes, the misrepresentation of modeled contributes to biases in ESM projections of gross primary production, transpiration, and temperature during droughts. Our results suggest that the severity and duration of droughts may be misrepresented in ESMs due to the impact of sustained g c on both soil moisture dynamics and the biosphere‐atmosphere feedbacks that affect local temperatures and regional weather patterns.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sea‐level rise (SLR) increasingly threatens coastal communities around the world. However, not all coastal communities are equally threatened, and realistic estimation of hazard is difficult. Understanding SLR impacts on extreme sea level is challenging due to interactions between multiple tidal and non‐tidal flood drivers. We here use global hourly tidal data to show how and why tides and surges interact with mean sea level (MSL) fluctuations. At most locations around the world, the amplitude of at least one tidal constituent and/or amplitude of non‐tidal residual have changed in response to MSL variation over the past few decades. In 37% of studied locations, “Potential Maximum Storm Tide” (PMST), a proxy for extreme sea level dynamics, co‐varies with MSL variations. Over all stations, the median PMST will be 20% larger by the mid‐century, and conventional approaches that simply shift the current storm tide regime up at the rate of projected SLR may underestimate the flooding hazard at these locations by up to a factor of four. Micro‐ and meso‐tidal systems and those with diurnal tidal regime are generally more susceptible to altered MSL than other categories. The nonlinear interactions of MSL and storm tide captured in PMST statistics contribute, along with projected SLR, to the estimated increase in flood hazard at three‐fourth of studied locations by mid‐21st century. PMST is a threshold that captures nonlinear interactions between extreme sea level components and their co‐evolution over time. Thus, use of this statistic can help direct assessment and design of critical coastal infrastructure.",

Feedbacks between soil C stocks and climate drivers could impact atmospheric CO 2 levels, further altering the climate. Here, we assessed the reliability of Earth system model (ESM) predictions of soil C change using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 and 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6). ESMs predicted global soil C gains under the high emission scenario, with soils taking up 43.9 Pg (95% CI: 9.2–78.5 Pg) C on average during the 21st century. The variation in global soil C change declined significantly from CMIP5 (with average of 48.4 Pg [95% CI: 2.0–94.9 Pg] C) to CMIP6 models (with average of 39.3 Pg [95% CI: 23.9–54.7 Pg] C). For some models, a small C increase in all biomes contributed to this convergence. For other models, offsetting responses between cold and warm biomes contributed to convergence. Although soil C predictions appeared to converge in CMIP6, the dominant processes driving soil C change at global or biome scales differed among models and in many cases between earlier and later versions of the same model. Random Forest models, for soil carbon dynamics, accounted for more than 63% variation of the global soil C change predicted by CMIP5 ESMs, but only 36% for CMIP6 models. Although most CMIP6 models apparently agree on increased soil C storage during the 21st century, this consensus obscures substantial model disagreement on the mechanisms underlying soil C response, calling into question the reliability of model predictions.",

Such extremes might be particularly detrimental (a) when they are compounded in more than one stressor, and (b) when the extremes extend substantially across the water column, restricting the habitable space for marine organisms. Here, we use daily output of a hindcast simulation (1961–2020) from the ocean component of the Community Earth System Model to characterize such column‐compound extreme events (CCX), employing a relative threshold approach to identify extremes and requiring them to extend vertically over at least 50 m. The diagnosed CCX are prevalent, occupying worldwide in the 1960s about 1% of the volume contained within the top 300 m. Over the duration of our simulation, CCX become more intense, last longer, and occupy more volume, driven by the trends in ocean warming and ocean acidification. For example, the triple CCX expanded 39‐fold, now last 3‐times longer, and became 6‐times more intense since the early 1960s. Removing this effect with a moving baseline permits us to better understand the key characteristics of CCX, revealing a typical duration of 10–30 days and a predominant occurrence in the Tropics and high latitudes, regions of high potential biological vulnerability. Overall, the CCX fall into 16 clusters, reflecting different patterns and drivers. Triple CCX are largely confined to the tropics and the North Pacific and tend to be associated with the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation.",

Existing estimates of global warming and climate sensitivity during the Pliocene rely mainly on model simulations. To reconstruct Pliocene climate and incorporate paleoclimate observations, we use data assimilation to blend sea‐surface temperature (SST) proxies with model simulations from the Pliocene Modeling Intercomparison Project 2 and the Community Earth System Models. The resulting reconstruction, “plioDA,” suggests that the mid‐Pliocene (3.25 Ma) was warmer than previously thought (on average 4.1°C warmer than preindustrial, 95% CI = 3.0°C–5.3°C), leading to a higher estimate of climate sensitivity (4.8°C per doubling of , 90% CI = 2.6°C–9.9°C). In agreement with previous work, the tropical Pacific zonal SST gradient during the mid‐Pliocene was moderately reduced (°C, 95% CI = –0.4°C). However, this gradient was more reduced during the early Pliocene (4.75 Ma, °C, 95% CI = –°C), a time period that is also warmer than the mid‐Pliocene (4.8°C above preindustrial, 95% CI = 3.6°C–6.2°C). PlioDA reconstructs a fresh North Pacific and salty North Atlantic, supporting Arctic gateway closure and contradicting the presence of Pacific Deep Water formation. Overall, plioDA updates our view of global and spatial climate change during the Pliocene, as well as raising questions about the state of ocean circulation and the drivers of differences between the early and mid‐Pliocene.",

Although there is high certainty that the induced field measured at Europa is attributed to a global‐scale subsurface ocean, there is still uncertainty around the possibility that the induced field measured at Callisto is evidence of an ocean. This uncertainty is due to the presence of a conductive ionosphere, which will also produce an induction signal in response to Jupiter's strong time‐varying magnetic field. Therefore, it is not yet known whether the observed induced field is attributable to the ionosphere, an ocean, or a combination of both. In this work, we use previously published simulations of Callisto's plasma interaction in combination with both an inverse and an ensemble forward modeling method to highlight the plausible range of interior properties of Callisto. We further constrain the ocean thickness and conductivity, ice shell thickness, and ionospheric conductivity that are required to explain the Galileo magnetometer observations. This is the first study to jointly consider all flybys to constrain the driving field and three flybys (C03, C09, and C10) to assess the induction response. Our results suggest that Callisto's response more likely arises from the combination of a thick conductive ocean and an ionosphere rather than from an ionosphere alone.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mantle plumes—upwellings of buoyant rock in Earth's mantle—feed hotspot volcanoes such as Hawai‘i. The size of volcanoes along the Hawai‘i–Emperor chain, and thus the magma flux of the Hawaiian plume, has varied over the past 85 million years. Fifteen and two million years ago, rapid bursts in magmatic production led to the emergence of large islands such as Pūhāhonu, Maui Nui and Hawai‘i, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we use new radiogenic Ce–Sr–Nd–Hf isotope data of Hawaiian shield lavas to quantify the composition and proportion of the different constituents of the Hawaiian plume over time. We find that most of the Hawaiian mantle source is peridotite that has experienced variable degrees of melt depletion before being incorporated into the plume. We show that the most isotopically enriched LOA ‐type compositions arise from the aggregation of melts from more depleted, trace element‐starved peridotite, causing the over‐visibility of melts from recycled crust in the mixture. Our results also show that upwelling of chemically more depleted, and thus less dense, more buoyant mantle peridotite occurred synchronously to an observed burst of magma production. Buoyancy variations induced by variably depleted peridotite may not only control the temporal patterns of volcanic productivity in Hawai‘i, but also those of other plumes world‐wide. The excess buoyancy of depleted peridotite may therefore be an underrated driving force for convective mantle flow, trigger and sustain active upwelling of relatively cool plumes, and control the geometry of mantle upwellings from variable depths.",

Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) of ground silicate minerals is an emerging CDR technology with the potential to decrease atmospheric CO 2 . However, there are few multi‐year field studies and considerable uncertainty in field‐rates of ERW. We explored combining finely ground metabasaltic rock with other soil CDR technologies (compost and biochar amendments) to stimulate carbon (C) sequestration. The combined ground rock (GR), compost, and biochar amendment had the greatest increases in soil C stocks over 3 years (15.3 ± 4.8 Mg C ha −1 ). All other treatments slowed or reversed background C losses, with GR‐only treatments reducing rates of soil C loss relative to the control but still losing soil C over time. Ground rock amendments lowered nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions by 11.0 ± 0.6 kg CO 2 e ha −1 yr −1 and increased methane (CH 4 ) consumption by 9.5 ± 3.5 to 18.4 ± 4.4 kg CO 2 e ha −1 yr −1 ; while noteworthy, emissions reductions were an order of magnitude smaller than organic C sequestration with compost amendments. The combined amendment yielded the greatest estimated net ecosystem benefit (3 year relative changes in soil C, estimated ERW rates, and greenhouse gas emissions) of −86.0 ± 24.7 Mg CO 2 e ha −1 . Benefits were dominated by soil organic C gains, directly from organic amendments and indirectly from increased plant growth. Weathering rates were &lt;10% of the theoretical potential.

Greenhouse gas emissions, if not abated aggressively, will lead to large increases in frequency and intensity of heat extremes. At the same time, many cities are facing severe air pollution problems featuring high‐PM episodes that last from days to weeks. Based on a high‐resolution decadal‐long model simulation using a state‐of‐the‐science regional chemistry‐climate model that is bias corrected against reanalysis, here we show that when daily average wet‐bulb temperature of 25 °C is taken as the threshold for severe health impacts, heat extremes frequency averaged over South Asia increases from 45 ± 5 days/year in 1997–2004 to 78 ± 3 days/year in 2046–2054 under RCP8.5 scenario. With daily averaged PM 2.5 surface concentration of 60 μg/m 3 defined as the threshold for such “unhealthy” extremes, high‐PM extremes would occur 132 ± 8 days/year in the Decade 2050 under RCP8.5. Even more concerning, due to the potential health impacts of two stressors acting in tandem, is the joint occurrence of the heatwave and high‐PM hazard (HHH), which would have substantial increases of 175% in frequency and 79% in duration. This is in contrast to the 73–76% increase for heatwave or high PM when assessed individually. The fraction of land exposed to prolonged HHH increases by more than tenfold in 2050. The alarming increases in just a few decades pose great challenges to adaptation and call for more aggressive mitigation. For example, under a lower emission pathway, the frequency of HHH will only increase by 58% with a lower frequency of high‐PM extremes.",

During the same time period, the CO 2 seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) has increased by ~50% or more. Disentangling complex processes that drive these changes has been challenging. In this study, we substitute spatial sensitivity to temperature for time to quantify the impact of temperature increase on gross primary production (GPP), total ecosystem respiration (TER), the fraction of Photosynthetic Active Radiation (fPAR), and the resulted contribution of these changes in amplifying the CO 2 SCA over the HLNF since 1960s. We use the spatial heterogeneity of GPP inferred from solar‐induced chlorophyll Fluorescence in combination with net ecosystem exchange (NEE) inferred from column CO 2 observations made between 2015 and 2017 from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2. We find that three quarters of the spatial variations in GPP can be explained by the spatial variation in the growing season mean temperature (GSMT). The long term hindcast captures both the magnitude and spatial variability of the trends in observed fPAR. We estimate that between 1960 and 2010, the increase in GSMT enhanced both GPP and the SCA of NEE by ~20%. The calculated enhancement of NEE due to increase in GSMT contributes 56–72% of the trend in the CO 2 SCA at high latitudes, much larger than simulations by most biogeochemical models.",

Despite surface asymmetries, top of the atmosphere temporally &amp; hemispherically averaged reflected solar irradiance appears symmetric over Northern/Southern hemispheres. This is confirmed with the use of surrogate time‐series, which provides margins of for possible hemispheric differences supported by Clouds and Earth's Radiant System data. time‐series are further analyzed by decomposition into a seasonal (yearly and half yearly) cycle and residuals. Variability in the reflected solar irradiance is almost entirely (99%) due to the seasonal variations, mostly due to seasonal variations in insolation. The residuals of hemispherically averaged are not only small, but also indistinguishable from noise, and thus not correlated across hemispheres. This makes yearly and sub‐yearly timescales unlikely as the basis for a symmetry‐establishing mechanism. The residuals however contain a global trend that is large, as compared to expected albedo feedbacks. It is also hemispherically symmetric, and thus indicates the possibility of a symmetry enforcing mechanism at longer timescales. To pinpoint precisely which parts of the Earth system establish the hemispheric symmetry, we create an energetically consistent cloud‐albedo field from the data. We show that the surface albedo asymmetry is compensated by asymmetries between clouds over extra‐tropical oceans, with southern hemispheric storm‐tracks being 11% cloudier than their northern hemisphere counterparts. This again indicates that, assuming the albedo symmetry is not a result of chance, its mechanism likely operates on large temporal and spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dawn storms are among the brightest events in the Jovian aurorae. Up to now, they had only been observed from Earth‐based observatories, only showing the Sun‐facing side of the planet. Here, we show for the first time global views of the phenomenon, from its initiation to its end and from the nightside of the aurora onto the dayside. Based on Juno's first 20 orbits, some patterns now emerge. Small short‐lived spots are often seen a couple of hours before the main emission starts to brighten and evolve from a straight arc to a more irregular one in the midnight sector. As the whole feature rotates dawn‐ward, the arc then separates into two arcs with a central initially void region that is progressively filled with emissions. A gap in longitude then often forms before the whole feature dims. Finally, it transforms into an equatorward‐moving patch of auroral emissions associated with plasma injection signatures. Some dawn storms remain weak and never fully develop. We also found cases of successive dawn storms within a few hours. Dawn storms thus share many fundamental features with the auroral signatures of the substorms at Earth, despite the substantial differences between the dynamics of the magnetosphere at the two planets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Drainage canals associated with logging and agriculture dry out organic soils in tropical peatlands, thereby threatening the viability of long‐term carbon stores due to increased emissions from decomposition, fire, and fluvial transport. In Southeast Asian peatlands, which have experienced decades of land use change, the exact extent and spatial distribution of drainage canals are unknown. This has prevented regional‐scale investigation of the relationships between drainage, land use, and carbon emissions. Here, we create the first regional map of drainage canals using high resolution satellite imagery and a convolutional neural network. We find that drainage is widespread—occurring in at least 65% of peatlands and across all land use types. Although previous estimates of peatland carbon emissions have relied on land use as a proxy for drainage, our maps show substantial variation in drainage density within land use types. Subsidence rates are 3.2 times larger in intensively drained areas than in non‐drained areas, highlighting the central role of drainage in mediating peat subsidence. Accounting for drainage canals was found to improve a subsidence prediction model by 30%, suggesting that canals contain information about subsidence not captured by land use alone. Thus, our data set can be used to improve subsidence and associated carbon emissions predictions in peatlands, and to target areas for hydrologic restoration.",

Upon considering a large city, questions arise such as, how much does that weigh? What are its effects on the landscape? Does it cause measurable subsidence? Here I calculate the weight of San Francisco Bay region urbanization, where 7.75 million people live at, or near the coast. It is difficult to account for everything that is in a city. I assume that most of the weight is buildings and their contents, which allows the use of base outline and height data to approximate their mass, which is cumulatively 1.6·10 12 kg. I build a series of finite element models to study effects of pressure exerted by the weight distribution. Within the elastic realm, I look at compression, flexure, isostatic compensation, stress change, dilatation, and fluid flow changes. Within the nonlinear realm I show example calculations of primary and secondary settlement of soils under load. The combined modeled subsidence from building loads is at least 5–80 mm, with the largest contributions coming from nonlinear settlement and creep in soils. A general result is closing of pore space and redirection of pore fluids. While the calculated subsidence of the Bay Area is relatively small compared with other sources of elevation change such as pumping and recharge of aquifers, all sources of subsidence are concerning given an expected 200–300 mm sea level rise at San Francisco by the year 2050.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen is a promising exoplanet biosignature due to the evolutionary advantage conferred by harnessing starlight for photosynthesis, and the apparent low likelihood of maintaining oxygen-rich atmospheres without life. Hypothetical scenarios have been proposed for non-biological oxygen accumulation on planets around late M-dwarfs, where the extended pre-main sequence may favor abiotic O$_2$ accumulation. In contrast, abiotic oxygen accumulation on planets around F, G, and K-type stars is seemingly less likely, provided they possess substantial non-condensable gas inventories. The comparative robustness of oxygen biosignatures around larger stars has motivated plans for next-generation telescopes capable of oxygen detection on planets around sun-like stars. However, the general tendency of terrestrial planets to develop oxygen-rich atmospheres across a broad range of initial conditions and evolutionary scenarios has not been explored. Here, we use a coupled thermal-geochemical-climate model of terrestrial planet evolution to illustrate three scenarios whereby significant abiotic oxygen can accumulate around sun-like stars, even when significant non-condensable gas inventories are present. For Earth-mass planets, we find abiotic oxygen can accumulate to modern levels if (1) the CO$_2$:H$_2$O ratio of the initial volatile inventory is high, (2) the initial water inventory exceeds ~50 Earth oceans, or (3) the initial water inventory is very low. Fortunately, these three abiotic oxygen scenarios could be distinguished from biological oxygen with observations of other atmospheric constituents or characterizing the planetary surface. This highlights the need for broadly capable next-generation telescopes that are equipped to constrain surface water inventories via time-resolved photometry and search for temporal biosignatures or disequilibrium biosignatures to assess whether oxygen is biogenic.",

We find that chloride deposits are commonly draped atop underlying topography, often associated with channels, sometimes perched above deep craters in local topographic lows, and span a wide range of elevations. Where measurable, chloride deposit thicknesses are typically &lt;3 m. The deposits range in elevation over tens of meters, inconsistent with previous hypotheses of playa‐like environments, which are very flat. Chloride deposit elevations within larger basins are typically asymmetric with chloride deposits much higher on the inlet channel side, indicating that (a) surface water runoff was the most likely water source and (b) the basins were likely not filled completely with water in a deep lake setting but rather chlorides formed within a series of shallow ponds. Mass balance allows local sourcing from mobilization of cations and chlorine from dust/soil. Though prior global‐scale studies report chloride deposits superimposed on Noachian terrains, crater‐counting of local, stratigraphically‐associated datable surfaces shows chlorides superimposed on 3.4–2.3 Ga volcanic terrain. This indicates that surface waters forming chloride deposits continued through the Hesperian and into the Amazonian, making them among the latest‐formed, large‐scale deposits of water‐related minerals on Mars. Collectively, data suggest formation from meltwater from episodic ice/snow deposits continuing until 2.0–2.5 Ga.",

Here we show that this dynamical setup started a chain of events leading to this long‐lasting and unusual event: positive temperature anomalies over Siberia caused early snowmelt, leading to substantial earlier vegetation greening accompanied by decreased soil moisture and browning in the summer. This soil moisture depletion and vegetation browning, in turn, increased the impact of the heatwave on the atmosphere through a land‐atmosphere feedback. This line of evidence suggests that large‐scale dynamics and land‐atmosphere interactions both contributed to the magnitude and persistence of this record‐breaking heatwave, in addition to the background global warming impact on mean temperature. Here, we describe a carry‐over effect in Siberia from a spring positive temperature anomaly into summer dryness and browning, with retroaction into the atmosphere. With the Arctic warming twice as fast as the global average, this event foreshadows the future of northern latitude continents and emphasizes the importance of both atmospheric dynamics and land‐atmosphere interactions in the future as the climate changes. More frequent similar events could have major consequences on the carbon cycle in these carbon‐rich northern latitude regions.",

However, the mechanisms responsible for concentrating subducted continental crust in the austral mantle are unknown. We show that subduction of sediments and subduction eroded material, and lower continental crust delamination, cannot generate this spatially coherent austral geochemical domain. However, continental collisions—associated with the assembly of Gondwana‐Pangea—were positioned predominantly in the southern hemisphere during the late Neoproterozoic appearance of widespread continental ultra‐high‐pressure metamorphic terranes, which marked the onset of deep subduction of upper continental crust. We propose that deep subduction of upper continental crust at ancient rifted‐passive margins during ca. 650‐300 Ma austral supercontinent assembly resulted in enhanced upper continental crust delivery into the southern hemisphere mantle. Similarly enriched mantle domains are absent in the boreal mantle plume source, for two reasons. First, continental crust subducted after 300 Ma—when the continents drifted into the northern hemisphere—has had insufficient time to return to the surface in plumes sampling the northern hemisphere mantle. Second, before the first known appearance of continental ultra‐high‐pressure rocks at 650 Ma, deep subduction of upper continental crust was uncommon, limiting its subduction into the northern (and southern) hemisphere mantle earlier in Earth history. Our model implies a recent formation of the austral enriched mantle domain, explains the geochemical dichotomy between austral and boreal plume sources, and may explain why there are twice as many austral hotspots as boreal hotspots.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Ordovician (Hirnantian; 445 Ma) hosts the second most severe mass extinction in Earth history, coinciding with Gondwanan glaciation and increased geochemical evidence for marine anoxia. It remains unclear whether cooling, expanded oxygen deficiency, or a combination drove the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (LOME). Here, we present combined iodine and sulfur isotope geochemical data from three globally distributed carbonate successions to constrain changes in local and global marine redox conditions. Iodine records suggest locally anoxic conditions were potentially pervasive on shallow carbonate shelves, while sulfur isotopes suggest a reduction in global euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) conditions. Late Katian sulfate‐sulfur isotope data show a large negative excursion that initiated during elevated sea level and continued through peak Hirnantian glaciation. Geochemical box modeling suggests a combination of decreasing pyrite burial and increasing weathering are required to drive the observed negative excursion suggesting a ∼3% decrease of global seafloor euxinia during the Late Ordovician. The sulfur datasets provide further evidence that this trend was followed by increases in euxinia which coincided with eustatic sea‐level rise during subsequent deglaciation in the late Hirnantian. A persistence of shelf anoxia against a backdrop of waning then waxing global euxinia was linked to the two LOME pulses. These results place important constraints on local and global marine redox conditions throughout the Late Ordovician and suggest that non‐sulfidic shelfal anoxia—along with glacioeustatic sea level and climatic cooling—were important environmental stressors that worsened conditions for marine fauna, resulting in the second‐largest mass extinction in Earth history and the only example during an icehouse climate.",

Yet, very large uncertainties exist on the role of key physical controlling parameters, including wind speed, sea state and water temperature. We propose a mechanistic sea spray generation function that is based on the physics of bubble bursting. The number and mean droplet radius of jet and film drops is described by scaling laws derived from individual bubble bursting laboratory and numerical experiments, as a function of the bubble radius and the water physico‐chemical properties (viscosity, density and surface tension, all functions of temperature), with drops radii at production from 0.1 to 500 µm. Next, we integrate over the bubble size distribution entrained by breaking waves. Finally, the sea spray generation function is obtained by considering the volume flux of entrained bubbles due to breaking waves in the field constrained by the third moment of the breaking distribution (akin to the whitecap coverage). This mechanistic approach naturally integrates the role of wind and waves via the breaking distribution and entrained air flux, and a sensitivity to temperature via individual bubble bursting mechanisms. The resulting sea spray generation function has not been tuned or adjusted to match any existing data sets, in terms of magnitude of sea salt emissions and recently observed temperature dependencies. The remarkable coherence between the model and observations of sea salt emissions therefore strongly supports the mechanistic approach and the resulting sea spray generation function.",

However, during the Pliocene, when carbon dioxide was above pre‐industrial levels, multiple lines of evidence suggest that SWNA was much wetter. While existing explanations for a wet Pliocene invoke increases in winter rain, recent modeling studies hypothesize that summer rain may have also played an important role. Here, we present the first direct evidence for an intensified mid‐Pliocene monsoon in SWNA using leaf wax hydrogen isotopes. These new records provide evidence that the mid‐Pliocene featured an intensified and expanded North American Monsoon. Using proxies and isotope‐enabled model simulations, we show that monsoon intensification is linked to amplified warming on the southern California margin relative to the tropical Pacific. This mechanism has clear relevance for understanding present‐day monsoon variations, since we show that intervals of amplified subtropical warming on the California margin, as are seen during modern California margin heat waves, are associated with a stronger monsoon. Because marine heat waves are predicted to increase in frequency, the future may bring intervals of “Pliocene‐like” rainfall that co‐exist with intensifying megadrought in SWNA, with implications for ecosystems, human infrastructure, and water resources.",

Here, we analyze a suite of observation‐based estimates of diapycnal mixing to assess its role within the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The rate of water mass transformation in the Atlantic Ocean's interior shows that there is a robust buoyancy increase in the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW, neutral density γ n ≃ 27.6–28.15), with a diapycnal circulation of 0.5–8 Sv between 48°N and 32°S in the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, tracers within the southward‐flowing NADW may undergo a substantial diapycnal transfer, equivalent to a vertical displacement of hundreds of meters in the vertical. This result, confirmed with a zonally averaged numerical model of the AMOC, indicates that mixing can alter where tracers upwell in the Southern Ocean, ultimately affecting their global pathways and ventilation timescales. These results point to the need for a realistic mixing representation in climate models in order to understand and credibly project the ongoing climate change.",

While high‐resolution weather models can forecast many types of extreme events on synoptic timescales, long‐term climatological risk assessment is an altogether different problem. A once‐in‐a‐century event takes, on average, 100 years of simulation time to appear just once, far beyond the typical integration length of a weather forecast model. Therefore, this task is left to cheaper, but less accurate, low‐resolution or statistical models. But there is untapped potential in weather model output: despite being short in duration, weather forecast ensembles are produced multiple times a week. Integrations are launched with independent perturbations, causing them to spread apart over time and broadly sample phase space. Collectively, these integrations add up to thousands of years of data. We establish methods to extract climatological information from these short weather simulations. Using ensemble hindcasts by the European Center for Medium‐range Weather Forecasting archived in the subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) database, we characterize sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events with multi‐centennial return times. Consistent results are found between alternative methods, including basic counting strategies and Markov state modeling. By carefully combining trajectories together, we obtain estimates of SSW frequencies and their seasonal distributions that are consistent with reanalysis‐derived estimates for moderately rare events, but with much tighter uncertainty bounds, and which can be extended to events of unprecedented severity that have not yet been observed historically. These methods hold potential for assessing extreme events throughout the climate system, beyond this example of stratospheric extremes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mid ocean ridge basalts are partial melts of mantle rocks that have become incompatible element depleted prior to recent sub‐ridge melting. This prior extent of melt extraction and concomitant incompatible element depletion is often inferred from the radiogenic isotope ratios of ridge basalts, such as hafnium and neodymium. However, hafnium isotope ratios by far exceeding those in ridge basalts are observed sporadically in exposed mantle rocks, abyssal peridotites. At least locally, therefore, Earth's mantle has evolved with much larger extents of incompatible element depletion over geologic time periods (10 8 –10 9 years) than inferred from ridge basalts. Here we show that such “ultra‐depleted” hafnium isotope signatures also characterize peridotites exposed at the Doldrums Fracture Zone in the equatorial Mid Atlantic. These peridotites are closely associated with peridotites characterized by hafnium‐neodymium isotope ratios similar to ridge basalts, but extensive incompatible element depletion. Our results demonstrate that Earth mantle's isotopic record of prior melt extraction is dampened by ubiquitous past and recent reaction with migrating melts. Hence, a better understanding of chemically reactive flow is required for deducing the mantle's rate of incompatible element depletion by recurring processing through melting regions in the shallow mantle, which is the driving force for silicate Earth evolution. Ultimately, better constraining the rate of incompatible element depletion from Earth's mantle is therefore of first‐order importance for understanding our planet's basic mode of operation.",

However, a lack of biogeochemical observations of SAMW properties during wintertime formation precluded their detailed characterization. Here we characterize for the first time SAMW properties across their entire wintertime formation regions based primarily on biogeochemical profiling floats. Observations show that the SAMW properties differ between the two main formation regions in the Pacific and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean. SAMW formed in the Pacific is colder, fresher, and higher in oxygen, nitrate, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) than its Indian Ocean counterpart. The relationship between potential density and biogeochemical water properties is nearly identical between the two formation regions; property differences thus predominantly reflect the difference in mean densities of SAMW formed in each region. SAMW is undersaturated in oxygen during formation, which will impact calculations of derived quantities that assume preformed oxygen saturation. SAMW is at or above atmospheric p CO 2 during wintertime and therefore not a direct sink of contemporary carbon dioxide during the formation period. Results from the Biogeochemical Southern Ocean State Estimate suggest anti‐correlated interannual variability of DIC, nitrate, and oxygen between the central and southeastern Pacific formation regions similar to previously established patterns in mixed layer physical properties. This indicates that the mean properties of SAMW will vary depending on which sub‐region has a stronger formation rate, which is in turn linked to the Southern Annual Mode and the El‐Niño Southern Oscillation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Projections of future carbon sinks and stocks are important because they show how the world's ecosystems will respond to elevated CO 2 and changes in climate. Moreover, they are crucial to inform policy decisions around emissions reductions to stay within the global warming levels identified by the Paris Agreement. However, Earth System Models from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) show substantial spread in future projections—especially of the terrestrial carbon cycle, leading to a large uncertainty in our knowledge of any remaining carbon budget (RCB). Here we evaluate the global terrestrial carbon cycle projections on a region‐by‐region basis and compare the global models with regional assessments made by the REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes, Phase 2 activity. Results show that for each region, the CMIP6 multi‐model mean is generally consistent with the regional assessment, but substantial cross‐model spread exists. Nonetheless, all models perform well in some regions and no region is without some well performing models. This gives confidence that the CMIP6 models can be used to look at future changes in carbon stocks on a regional basis with appropriate model assessment and benchmarking. We find that most regions of the world remain cumulative net sources of CO 2 between now and 2100 when considering the balance of fossil‐fuels and natural sinks, even under aggressive mitigation scenarios. This paper identifies strengths and weaknesses for each model in terms of its performance over a particular region including how process representation might impact those results and sets the agenda for applying stricter constraints at regional scales to reduce the uncertainty in global projections.",

Recent work showed the weakening is not significantly affected by changes in the Arctic, but did not examine the role of different anthropogenic forcings such as aerosols. Here we use the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) simulations to quantify the impact of anthropogenic aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing. The DAMIP simulations show aerosols and greenhouse gases contribute equally to zonal-mean circulation weakening. Regionally, aerosol dominates the Pacific storm track weakening whereas greenhouse gas dominates in the Atlantic. Using a regional energetic framework, we show why the impact of aerosol is the largest in the Pacific. Reduced sulfate aerosol emissions over Eurasia and North America increase (clear-sky) surface shortwave radiation and turbulent fluxes. This enhances land-to-ocean energy contrast and energy transport via stationary circulations to the ocean. Consequently, energy converges poleward of oceanic storm tracks, demanding weaker poleward energy transport storm tracks, and the storm tracks weaken. The impact is larger over the Pacific following the larger emission decrease over Eurasia than North America. Similar yet opposite, increased aerosol emissions over South and East Asia decrease shortwave radiation and weaken land-to-ocean energy transport. This diverges energy equatorward of the Pacific storm track, further weakening it. Our results show aerosols are a dominant driver of regional circulation weakening during the NH summertime in the satellite era and a regional energetic framework explaining the underlying processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Southern Ocean is rich in highly dynamic mesoscale eddies and substantially modulates global biogeochemical cycles. However, the overall surface and subsurface effects of eddies on the Southern Ocean biogeochemistry have not been quantified observationally at a large scale. Here, we co‐locate eddies, identified in the Meta3.2DT satellite altimeter‐based product, with biogeochemical Argo floats to determine the effects of eddies on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), nitrate, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the upper 1,500 m of the ice‐free Southern Ocean, as well as the eddy effects on the carbon fluxes in this region. DIC and nitrate concentrations are lower in anticyclonic eddies (AEs) and increased in cyclonic eddies (CEs), while dissolved oxygen anomalies switch signs above (CEs: positive, AEs: negative) and below the mixed layer (CEs: negative, AEs: positive). We attribute these anomalies primarily to eddy pumping (isopycnal heave), as well as eddy trapping for oxygen. Maximum anomalies in all tracers occur at greater depths in the subduction zone north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) compared to the upwelling region in the ACC, reflecting differences in background vertical structures. Eddy effects on air–sea exchange have significant seasonal variability, with additional outgassing in CEs in fall (physical process) and additional oceanic uptake in AEs and CEs in spring (biological and physical process). Integrated over the Southern Ocean, AEs contribute 0.01 Pg C (7 ) to the Southern Ocean carbon uptake, and CEs offset this by 0.01 Pg C (2 ). These findings underscore the importance of considering eddy impacts in observing networks and climate models.",

We report an auroral electrojet spike event that is extreme in magnitude, explosive in nature, and global in spatial extent that occurred on 24 April 2023. The event serves as a fundamental test of our understanding of the response of the geospace system to solar wind dynamics. Our results illustrate new and important characteristics that are drastically different from existing knowledge. Most important findings include (a) the event was only of ∼5‐min duration and was limited to a narrow (2°–3°) band of diffuse aurora; (b) the longitudinal span covered the entire nightside sector, possibly extending to the dayside; (c) the trigger seems to be a transient solar wind dynamic pressure pulse. In comparison, substorms usually last 1–2 hr and span almost the entire latitudinal width of the auroral oval. Magnetic perturbation events (MPEs) span hundreds km in radius. Both substorms and MPEs are mainly driven by disturbances in the magnetotail. A possible explanation is that the pressure pulse compresses the magnetosphere and enhances diffuse precipitation of electrons and protons from the inner plasma sheet, which elevates the ionospheric conductivity and intensifies the auroral electrojet. Therefore, the event exhibits a potentially new type of geomagnetic disturbance and highlights a solar wind driver that is enormously influential in driving extreme space weather events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Clouds play a crucial role in Earth's energy budget resulting in significant deviations from clear‐sky fluxes. This important role, combined with their complexity, makes them a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. Over the past two decades, the radiative signatures of clouds in their surroundings have been extensively studied, highlighting the challenges of defining clouds and distinguishing them from the aerosol embedded in clear‐sky. Accurately defining clouds and aerosol is essential for quantifying their radiative effects and for remote sensing of the surface and atmosphere under clear‐sky conditions. In this study, we combine two of the most mature and sophisticated space‐borne instruments: the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer with its high‐resolution multispectral images and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System broadband top‐of‐the‐atmosphere radiative flux data. This0 allows us to quantify the net RE of clouds within the clear‐sky around them for the first time. Our findings show that the local RE of clouds over the ocean around noon ranges from −7 to −10 W in the solar band and 1–1.5 W in the longwave infrared. These results suggest that clouds drive a significant portion of the aerosol direct RE. Additionally, the near‐cloud longwave infrared effect is equivalent to an effect of 90 ppm of . We propose to categorize the sky into three regimes—cloudy, cloud‐influenced‐clear‐sky, and far‐field clear‐sky and suggest a path to move beyond a discrete definition of the sky. This will improve our understanding of the role of clouds and aerosol in the climate system, ultimately reducing uncertainties in climate projections.",

While several theories have been proposed to explain these variations, the underlying factors driving these differences are still not fully understood. In this study, we analyze 24,000 km of active global subduction zones around the globe to determine how subduction zone obliquity affects deformation in the trench‐parallel and horizontal directions on land above subduction zones. We take advantage of recently published worldwide data sets of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) velocities and global active fault catalogs in order to examine deformation at 13 of the world's forearcs. We analyze deformation over both short (decadal) timescales, captured by GNSS, and long (millennial to million‐year) timescales, observed through trench‐parallel active forearc faults. The results reveal a strong link between subduction obliquity and both the sense and amount of forearc rotation detected by GNSS, as well as the sense and rate of deformation along trench‐parallel strike‐slip faults. Unlike previous studies indicating that subduction obliquity affects forearc deformation only beyond a certain threshold, we demonstrate that even low to moderate obliquity significantly influences the observed deformation.",

These changes can impact, among others, the lifespan of objects in low Earth orbit, refraction of radio communication and GPS signals, and the peak altitudes of meteoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere.

The existence, spatial distribution, and general properties of HSEFs in the Earth magnetotail are still unknown. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey of HSEFs in the Earth magnetotail, utilizing NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission observations from 2017 to 2021. A total of 642 events characterized by electron bulk speeds exceeding 5,000 km/s are identified. The main statistical properties are: (a) The duration of almost all HSEFs are less than 4 s, and the average duration is 0.74 s. (b) HSEFs exhibit a strong dawn‐dusk (30%–70%) asymmetry. (c) 39.6%, 29.0%, and 31.4% of the events are located in the plasma sheet, plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL), and lobe region, respectively. (d) In the plasma sheet, HSEFs have arbitrary moving directions regarding the ambient magnetic field, and the events near the neutral line predominantly move along the same direction as the ion outflows, indicating outflow electrons generated by magnetic reconnection. (e) HSEFs in the PSBL and lobe mainly move along the ambient magnetic field, and 70% of HSEFs in the PSBL exhibit features of reconnection inflow. The HSEFs in lobe regions may locate near the reconnection electron edges. Our study reveals that the HSEFs in magnetotail are closely associated with magnetic reconnection, and the statistical results deepen the understanding of HSEF fundamental properties in collisionless plasma.",

Longstanding theories employing “gray” radiation tie the tropopause temperature to outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), but this is in contrast to recent work in which simulations exhibit a Fixed Tropopause Temperature (FiTT) even as OLR increases. The FiTT is thought to result from the interaction between upper tropospheric moisture and radiation, but a predictive theory for FiTT has not yet been formulated. Here, we build on a recent explanation for the temperature of anvil clouds and argue that tropopause temperature, defined by where radiative cooling becomes negligible, is set by water vapor's maximum spectroscopic absorption and Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling. This “thermospectric constraint” makes quantitative predictions for tropopause temperature that are borne out in single column and general circulation model experiments where the spectroscopy is modified and both the radiative and lapse‐rate tropopause change in response. This constraint provides a theoretical foundation for the FiTT hypothesis and a more refined explanation for why the tropopause rises with surface warming, shows how tropopause temperature can decouple from OLR, suggests a way to relate the temperatures of anvil clouds and the tropopause, and shows how spectroscopy manifests in Earth's general circulation.",

These drivers include changes in nutrient loading, human‐accelerated chemical weathering of watersheds, acid‐rain and land‐use changes, and ocean acidification due to atmospheric CO 2 increase. We lack understanding of how these co‐occurring processes have influenced long‐term pH T changes in coastal waters. To address this knowledge gap, a coupled hydrodynamic‐biogeochemical‐carbonate chemistry model was used to conduct a hindcast simulation and scenario analyses of carbonate chemistry in the Chesapeake Bay between 1951 and 2010. Trend analysis reveals increasing pH T in the upper Bay due to river alkalinization but decreasing pH T in the bottom waters of the mid‐and lower Bay due to ocean acidification. No trend is detected in the surface waters of the mid‐ and lower Bay due to competition between the two drivers. The effect of river alkalinization on the acidic volume in the estuary is twice that of ocean acidification. Our findings show that river alkalinization provides an important buffer against acidification while eutrophication plays a secondary role. Our results also suggest ocean alkalinity enhancement could be effective in mitigating acidification in coastal waters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the Subantarctic Southern Ocean, primary productivity is predominantly limited by seasonal changes in light and iron (Fe) availability, shaping the phytoplankton community and impacting the magnitude of the biological carbon pump. However, quantifying the seasonal iron cycle is challenging, as observations of bioavailable, dissolved iron (DFe) from individual campaigns rarely span a full seasonal cycle. Here, we present a composite seasonal cycle constructed from 27 years of DFe observations at the subantarctic Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) south of Australia. Iron measurements are paired with time series data to explain the iron cycle contextualized to broader Southern Ocean biogeochemistry. Three distinct phases were revealed with clear coupling between iron and productivity in the first two phases. In the first phase, light limitation initially controls spring to summer primary production with shoaling of the mixed layer, accounting for around half of annual net community production (ANCP). In the second phase and remaining half of ANCP, rapid biomass increases and near‐complete drawdown of DFe drive iron limitation, evidenced by maximum fluorescence‐to‐chlorophyll ratios. A subset of this period covering a third of ANCP exhibits a mean Fe:C uptake ratio of 31.08 ± 8.88 μmol:mol. During the third phase, iron is weakly coupled to productivity as the system transitions to net heterotrophy and biomass declines despite increased Fe supply associated with the east Australian current system. Together, 27 years of continuous monitoring draws a comprehensive picture of how and when iron fuels subantarctic productivity, providing a critical baseline for model validation and continued monitoring in a rapidly changing climate.",

Our results suggest that these events likely initiate from metastable olivine transformations within the cold slab core and rupture beyond the MOW due to sustained weakening from molten rock at the rupture tip. Over half of the earthquakes likely rupture beyond the MOW boundary and are controlled by both mechanisms. Rupturing outside the MOW boundary leads to greater moment release, increased geometric complexity, and a reduction in rupture length, causing greater stress drops.",

This distinct behavior is attributed to the broad distribution of ULF waves in the upstream region at Mars, generated not only by shock‐reflected ions but also by planetary protons. Additionally, during the reformation process, the amplitude of the ULF waves and the steepened structures are significantly large. This results in the newly reformed shock exceeding the original one, a phenomenon not observed at other planets under similar shock conditions. Therefore, the ULF waves significantly enhance the complexity of shock dynamics and play a more substantial role at Mars compared to other planets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cities play a crucial role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. While activity‐based (“bottom up”) emission estimates are widely used for global cities, they often lack independent verification. In this study, we use remotely‐sensed CO 2 observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐3 (OCO‐3) to “top‐down” estimate CO 2 emissions for 54 global cities. This global‐scale analysis is enabled by a computationally efficient cross‐sectional flux approach, which uses NO 2 observations from TROPOMI and trajectory simulations from HYSPLIT to identify OCO‐3 pixels influenced by urban plumes. Our satellite‐based emission estimates for 54 global cities agree within 7% to two widely used bottom‐up data sets but reveal regional discrepancies. Bottom‐up estimates tend to overestimate emissions for cities in Central East Asia and South and West Asia, while underestimating emissions in Africa, East and Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania, Europe, and North America. Additionally, our satellite‐based socioeconomic analysis shows that (a) high‐income cities tend to have less carbon‐intensive economies: North American cities emit 0.1 kg CO 2 per USD of economic output, while African cities emit 0.5 kg CO 2 per USD, and (b) per capita emissions decrease with increasing population size, from 7.7 tCO 2 /person for cities under 5 million residents to 1.8 tCO 2 /person for cities over 20 million residents. This study highlights the potential of satellite data to bridge gaps between top‐down and bottom‐up emission estimates, enhancing the robustness and transparency of emissions monitoring. Our findings emphasize the growing role of satellite data in verifying urban CO 2 emissions and supporting efforts to mitigate emissions for global cities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The core tools of science (data, software, and computers) are undergoing a rapid and historic evolution, changing what questions scientists ask and how they find answers. Earth science data are being transformed into new formats optimized for cloud storage that enable rapid analysis of multi‐petabyte data sets. Data sets are moving from archive centers to vast cloud data storage, adjacent to massive server farms. Open source cloud‐based data science platforms, accessed through a web‐browser window, are enabling advanced, collaborative, interdisciplinary science to be performed wherever scientists can connect to the internet. Specialized software and hardware for machine learning and artificial intelligence are being integrated into data science platforms, making them more accessible to average scientists. Increasing amounts of data and computational power in the cloud are unlocking new approaches for data‐driven discovery. For the first time, it is truly feasible for scientists to bring their analysis to data in the cloud without specialized cloud computing knowledge. This shift in paradigm has the potential to lower the threshold for entry, expand the science community, and increase opportunities for collaboration while promoting scientific innovation, transparency, and reproducibility. Yet, we have all witnessed promising new tools which seem harmless and beneficial at the outset become damaging or limiting. What do we need to consider as this new way of doing science is evolving?",

    "abstract": "Northern Europe is typically characterized by wet conditions, where the total evaporation and transpiration (together, \"evapotranspiration\") largely depend on atmospheric energy supply. Dirmeyer et al. (2021) report that in the hot and dry summer of 2018 evapotranspiration became water-limited such that decreased evaporative cooling amplified the heatwave temperatures. This way, drought magnitude increased beyond a critical point with consequent disruptions in ecosystem services. The land surface provides essential ecosystem services for society. Soils and vegetation take up atmospheric CO2 (Heimann & Reichstein, 2008), their moisture can attenuate wildfires (Forkel et al., 2019, O.S., Hou, et al., 2020), and their evaporative cooling can mitigate hot temperatures (Seneviratne et al., 2012). These services depend on the meteorological conditions; high radiation and low rainfall can induce water stress in ecosystems and consequently limit their services (Figure 1). In semiarid regions experiencing dry seasons such as Central North America and Southern Europe, the lack of water supply limits evapotranspiration, a condition known as water limitation (Mueller & Seneviratne, 2012). This is usually not the case for northern Europe, where normally wet and cloudy weather creates conditions where evaporation rates are limited by energy supply. Wet, energy-limited (left) versus dry, water-limited (right) land surface regimes. Vegetation translates meteorological forcing such as radiation and precipitation to ecosystem services as, for example, temperature regulation and CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. This way, variations in the meteorological forcing are reflected in contrasting ecosystem services; evaporative cooling and CO2 uptake are often stronger in wet conditions, while in a dry regime increased sensible heating promotes hot temperatures. However, the 2018 summer drought introduced water-limited conditions to Great Britain and large parts of Northern Europe (Dirmeyer et al., 2021). Thereby, this region became a hot spot of land-atmosphere interactions; in addition to the prevailing impact of the meteorological conditions on soils and vegetation (atmosphere → land), soil moisture availability affected vegetation functioning and therefore evapotranspiration and the (near-surface) atmospheric moisture and energy budgets (land → atmosphere). This process is reinforced through a positive feedback (Seneviratne et al., 2010; Teuling, 2018); decreasing evapotranspiration contributes to warmer temperatures which in turn increases the evaporative demand which further depletes the soil moisture. Also, the increased atmospheric dryness can hinder cloud formation (Teuling et al., 2017), leading to more incoming radiation, which also contributes to warmer temperatures. Moreover, this feedback loop can spread impacts in space by advection of drier air masses to neighboring regions (Schumacher et al., 2019), and in time through lagged recovery of the vegetation after severe water stress (Bastos et al., 2020). Soil moisture is a key variable controlling the land-atmosphere coupling regime and its strength (Seneviratne et al., 2010). Dirmeyer et al. (2021) determine soil moisture thresholds across Europe, below which evaporative cooling becomes water-limited, enhancing peak temperatures. These thresholds vary in space, highlighting the role of vegetation and soil types in modulating land-atmosphere interactions (Denissen et al., 2020). While potential threshold variations in time, for example in response to land cover change, are yet to be investigated, their estimates can inform (near-)future forecasts and anticipation of record-breaking temperatures. Estimating these thresholds from observation-based data sets (Denissen et al., 2020) is only possible in regions that have already entered a water-limited regime to reveal the underlying soil moisture. In other regions, we have to rely on (future) modeling experiments to provide such estimates. This requires an accurate representation of the land-atmosphere coupling, including the different processes shaping near-surface weather between energy- and water-limited conditions (Flach et al., 2018). Land surface models are imperfect in this respect (Best et al., 2015; Dirmeyer et al., 2018; O. S., Dutra, et al., 2020). Nevertheless, they are indispensable tools; particularly in view of ongoing climate change, which increases the occurrence probability of unprecedented conditions as in 2018. Modeling and forecasting should rely on physical laws rather than empirical relationships that might not be applicable under transient conditions (O. S., Dutra, et al., 2020). Continued model development that improves and expands the representation of relevant processes will further enhance their applicability (Balsamo et al., 2009; Lawrence et al., 2019; Thum et al., 2019). The development of land surface models, and the understanding of relevant processes and interactions, is promoted by a growing suite of observational data (Balsamo et al., 2018). The benefits of jointly analyzing measurements and model simulations in this context are demonstrated by Dirmeyer et al. (2021); in situ measurements are limited in temporal and spatial coverage but represent ground truth and can be used to test how well models can represent the analyzed relationship and that their simulations can accordingly be employed to extend the analyses in time and space. Satellite and ground-based Earth observations of multiple variables are assimilated by models to yield high-quality reanalyses, as for example the ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020) used by Dirmeyer et al. (2021). Furthermore, machine learning is an emerging tool in Earth system science (Reichstein et al., 2019) to derive large-scale data sets of, for example, soil moisture (O. S. & Orth, 2021) or evapotranspiration (Jung et al., 2019) by establishing relationships between respective in situ observations and meteorological data which are then used for spatiotemporal extrapolation. Such independent data-driven estimates can be used to validate and assess process-based models. In addition, within hybrid modeling setups, machine learning may be applied to assist models more directly through, for example, the estimation of parameter values in time and space. The results of Dirmeyer et al. (2021) illustrate that hot spot regions of land-atmosphere coupling can occur in comparatively wet and cold climate in the case of extreme events. The strong coupling, which is well known to occur in semiarid regions (Koster et al., 2004), thereby shifts and extends to humid regions (Seneviratne et al., 2006). Such land-surface regime shifts may become more frequent and pronounced in the future (Dirmeyer et al., 2016); warming temperatures increase the evaporative demand which can lead to drier soils, independent of trends in precipitation. Overall, this highlights the key role of soils and vegetation for near-surface climate: while they might amplify the atmospheric climate change signal by intensifying hot extremes and the depletion of water resources (Orth & Destouni, 2018), smart management of them can alleviate changes at regional scales (Davin et al., 2014; Destouni et al., 2013; Teuling et al., 2010; Thiery et al., 2020).

    "abstract": "Strong thermal emission velocity enhancement (STEVE) is an optical phenomenon of the subauroral ionosphere arising from extreme ion drift speeds. STEVE consists of two distinct components in true‐color imagery: a mauve or whitish arc extended in the magnetic east–west direction and a region of green emission adjacent to the arc, often structured into quasiperiodic columns aligned with the geomagnetic field (the “picket fence”). This work employs high‐resolution imagery by citizen scientists in a critical examination of fine‐scale features within the green emission region. Of particular interest are narrow “streaks” of emission forming underneath field‐aligned picket fence elements in the 100‐ to 110‐km altitude range. The streaks propagate in curved trajectories with dominant direction toward STEVE from the poleward side. The elongation is along the direction of motion, suggesting a drifting point‐like excitation source, with the apparent elongation due to a combination of motion blur and radiative lifetime effects. The cross‐sectional dimension is &lt;1 km, and the cases observed have a duration of ∼ 20–30 s. The uniform coloration of all STEVE green features in these events suggests a common optical spectrum dominated by the oxygen 557.7‐nm emission line. The source is most likely direct excitation of ambient oxygen by superthermal electrons generated by ionospheric turbulence induced by the extreme electric fields driving STEVE. Some conjectures about causal connections with overlying field‐aligned structures are presented, based on coupling of thermal and gradient‐drift instabilities, with analogues to similar dynamics observed from chemical release and ionospheric heating experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Global Climate Models (GCMs) exhibit substantial biases in their simulation of tropical climate. One particularly problematic bias exists in GCMs' simulation of the tropical rainband known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Much of the precipitation on Earth falls within the ITCZ, which plays a key role in setting Earth's temperature by affecting global energy transports, and partially dictates dynamics of the largest interannual mode of climate variability: The El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Most GCMs fail to simulate the mean state of the ITCZ correctly, often exhibiting a “double ITCZ bias,” with rainbands both north and south rather than just north of the equator. These tropical mean state biases limit confidence in climate models' simulation of projected future and paleoclimate states, and reduce the utility of these models for understanding present climate dynamics. Adjusting GCM parameterizations of cloud processes and atmospheric convection can reduce tropical biases, as can artificially correcting sea surface temperatures through modifications to air‐sea fluxes (i.e., “flux adjustment”). Here, we argue that a significant portion of these rainfall and circulation biases are rooted in orographic height being biased low due to assumptions made in fitting observed orography onto GCM grids. We demonstrate that making different, and physically defensible, assumptions that raise the orographic height significantly improves model simulation of climatological features such as the ITCZ and North American rainfall as well as the simulation of ENSO. These findings suggest a simple, physically based, and computationally inexpensive method that can improve climate models and projections of future climate.",

Despite known socio‐environmental effects of EAG there remains a need to enhance monitoring capabilities for better informing conservation and management practices. Here, we integrate field observations, remote sensing and climate data with machine‐learning techniques to estimate and assess patterns of historical (1985–2019; R 2 = 0.86 ± 0.05; MAE = 6.7 ± 1.4%), present (2020), and future (2025–2040) EAG abundance (30‐m) across much of the western United States. Trend analysis revealed that ∼8% and 1% of the landscape experienced significant rises and declines in historical EAG cover, respectively, with hotspots of invasion generally occurring near roads and along low‐to‐mid elevation gradients with warmer and drier conditions. Accurate simulations of the response of EAG to changing environmental conditions, disturbances and management treatments indicate that ecosystem resistance to invasion is largely controlled by long‐term EAG abundance (surrogate for seed bank), time since and frequency of wildfire, and plant community interactions. Ecological thresholds associated with enhanced probabilities of wildfire occurrence and invasion rates indicate that relatively little (10%) EAG cover is needed to heighten these risks. Climate change is expected to push 8% of the landscape across invasion thresholds by 2040, impacting 6% of existing sage‐grouse habitat, and we identify where fuel breaks may be placed to reduce wildfire risks and invasion. Spatially detailed, timely, and accurate depictions of past, present, and future EAG abundance are vital for the protection of life and property and the continued stewardship of sagebrush ecosystems.",

We evaluated a non‐parametric ground‐motion detection and alerting strategy that would alert the entire Costa Rican population of any event with a ground motion detection threshold of 0.55–0.65 %g at four neighboring stations. During a 6‐month evaluation period ASTUTI detected and alerted on five of 13 earthquakes with M w 4.8–5.3 that caused felt Modified Mercalli Intensity shaking levels of 4.3–6. The system did not produce any false alerts and the undetected events did not produce wide‐spread or significant felt shaking. System latencies were less than or similar to scientific‐grade latencies. Alerts for all five detected events would have reached the capital city, San Jose, before strong S ‐wave shaking. This would have afforded time for Drop Cover Hold On actions by most residents. Two of the five alerts were triggered by P ‐waves suggesting that smartphone‐based networks could approach the fastest theoretical EEW performance, especially with future expected improvements in smartphone sensors and processing algorithms.",

The State of California has set an ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, relying in part on enhanced carbon sequestration in natural and working lands. We used statistical modeling, including random forest and climate analog approaches, to explore the climate‐driven challenges and uncertainties associated with the goal of long‐term carbon sequestration in forests and shrublands. We found that seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation are strong controllers of the spatial distribution of aboveground live carbon. RCP8.5 projections of temperature and precipitation are estimated to drive decreases of 16.1% ± 7.5% in aboveground live carbon by the end of the century, with coastal areas of central and northern California and low/mid‐elevation mountain areas being most vulnerable. With RCP4.5 projections, declines are less severe, with 8.8% ± 5.3% carbon loss. In either scenario, increases in temperature systematically cause biomass declines, and the spread of projected precipitation across 32 CMIP5 models contributes to substantial uncertainty in the magnitude of that decline. Projected changes in the environmental niche for the 20 most biomass‐dominant tree species revealed widespread replacement of conifers by oak species in low elevation regions of central and northern California, with a corresponding decline in carbon storage depending on expected migration rates. The spatial patterns of vulnerability we identify may allow policymakers to assess where carbon sequestration in aboveground biomass is an appropriate part of a climate mitigation portfolio, and where future climate‐driven carbon losses may be a liability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Organic carbon (OC) sedimentation in marine sediments is the largest long‐term sink of atmospheric CO 2 after silicate weathering. Understanding the mechanistic and quantitative aspects of OC delivery and preservation in marine sediments is critical for predicting the role of the oceans in modulating global climate. Yet, estimates of the global OC sedimentation in marginal settings span an order of magnitude, and the primary controls of OC preservation remain highly debated. Here, we provide the first global bottom‐up estimate of OC sedimentation along the margins using a synthesis of literature data. We quantify both terrestrial‐ and marine‐sourced OC fluxes and perform a statistical analysis to discern the key factors influencing their magnitude. We find that the margins host 23.2 ± 3.5 Tmol of OC sedimentation annually, with approximately 84% of marine origin. Accordingly, we calculate that only 2%–3% of OC exported from the euphotic zone escapes remineralization before sedimentation. Surprisingly, over half of all global OC sedimentation occurs below bottom waters with oxygen concentrations greater than 180 μM, while less than 4% occurs in settings with &lt;50 μM oxygen. This challenges the prevailing paradigm that bottom‐water oxygen (BWO) is the primary control on OC preservation. Instead, our statistical analysis reveals that water depth is the most significant predictor of OC sedimentation, surpassing all other factors investigated, including BWO levels and sea‐surface chlorophyll concentrations. This finding suggests that the primary control on OC sedimentation is not production, but the ability of OC to resist remineralization during transit through the water column and while settling on the seafloor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite much interest in relationships among carbon and water in forests, few studies assess how carbon accumulation scales with water use in forested watersheds with varied histories. This study quantified tree growth, water use efficiency, and carbon‐water tradeoffs of young versus mature/old‐growth forest in three small (13–22 ha) watersheds in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. To quantify and scale carbon‐water tradeoffs from trees to watersheds, tree‐ring records and greenness and wetness indices from remote sensing were combined with long‐term vegetation, climate, and streamflow data from young forest watersheds (trees ∼45 years of age) and from a mature/old‐growth forest watershed (trees 150–500 years of age). Biomass production was closely related to water use; water use efficiency (basal area increment per unit of evapotranspiration) was lower; and carbon‐water tradeoffs were steeper in young forest plantations compared with old‐growth forest for which the tree growth record begins in the 1850s. Greenness and wetness indices from Landsat imagery were not significant predictors of streamflow or tree growth over the period 1984 to 2017, and soil C and N did not differ significantly among watersheds. Multiple lines of evidence show that mature and old‐growth forest watersheds store and accumulate more carbon, are more drought resistant, and better sustain water availability compared to young forests. These results provide a basis for reconstructions and predictions that are potentially broadly applicable, because first‐order watersheds occupy 80%–90% of large river basins and study watersheds are representative of forest history in the Pacific Northwest region.",

In recent decades, the Siberian wildfire regime has been shifting; however, less is known about its process‐based feedback mechanisms. By integrating in‐situ and satellite observational data sets as well as chemistry‐climate coupled modeling, we find that central Siberia has featured the most prominent wildfire escalation during the past two decades, which is closely related to hydrological drought with decreasing rainfall and drying soil under a fast‐warming Arctic. Furthermore, fire‐emitted aerosols compound the increasing wildfires via serving as cloud condensation nuclei and suppressing precipitation, forming self‐amplifying feedback. As the Arctic warming is projected to continue, wildfires are estimated to more than double by the end of this century. This work highlights the great importance of fire risk management based on a fundamental scientific understanding of the complex climate system.",

We employ extensive databases of spacecraft observations to specify their distribution. We show that under extreme geomagnetic conditions, lower‐band whistler mode chorus waves have a net effect of accelerating ultra‐relativistic electrons, which results in an increase of fluxes at multi‐MeV energies by several orders of magnitude. During future magnetic superstorms, the radiation levels in the outer zone could therefore experience a substantial increase beyond what has been previously observed during the space age.",

This earthquake exhibited unusual complexity and some first‐order aspects of its evolution remain unclear; for example, how and when the Papatea fault (PF) and the corresponding large surface deformation occurred. For various earthquake models, a seismic wave propagation code is used to simulate time‐dependent surface deformations, which then excite IAWs in a 3D compressible nonlinear atmospheric model, coupled with a 2D nonlinear multispecies ionospheric plasma dynamic model. Our preferred finite‐fault model reproduces the amplitudes, shapes, and time epochs of appearance of detected TEC perturbations well. Additionally, the incorporation of the PF, ruptured during the earthquake, results in the closest agreement between simulated and observed near‐zenith vertical TEC perturbations, whereas its absence shows significant discrepancy. This supports the hypothesis that the PF was ruptured during the Kaikoura earthquake. Furthermore, the IAWs and resulting ionospheric plasma disturbances contain additional information on the PF rupture progression, including the timing of initiation and propagation direction, indicating new opportunities to further constrain the PF rupture with low elevation angle “slant” TEC data. The results confirm the ability for TEC measurements to constrain evolutions of large crustal earthquakes to provide new insight beyond traditional seismic and geodetic data sets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The hallmark of great earthquakes in the Mediterranean is the 21 July 365 CE earthquake and tsunami that destroyed cities and killed thousands of people throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. This event is intriguing because most Mediterranean subduction forearcs exhibit pervasive crustal extension and minimal definitive evidence exists for great subduction megathrust earthquakes, consistent with weak seismic coupling. This conundrum has led many to favor rupture of a previously unrecognized upper plate splay fault south of Crete in an M w 8.3–8.5 earthquake, uplifting a Cretan Holocene paleoshoreline by up to 9 m. Similar source mechanisms have been adapted for the region, which are commonly used for seismic and tsunami hazard estimation. We present an alternative model for Holocene paleoshoreline uplift and the 365 CE tsunami that centers on known active normal fault systems offshore of western and southwestern Crete. We use new and published radiocarbon dates and historical records to show that uplift of the Cretan paleoshoreline likely occurred during two or more earthquakes within 2–3 centuries. Visco‐elastic dislocation modeling demonstrates that the rupture of these normal faults fits observed data as well as reverse fault models but requires reduced slip and lower cumulative earthquake energy release (∼ M w 7.9). Tsunami modeling shows that normal‐fault ruptures produce strong tsunamis that better match historical reports than a hypothetical reverse fault. Our findings collectively favor the interpretation that damaging earthquakes and tsunamis in the Eastern Mediterranean can originate on normal faults, highlighting the potential hazard from tsunamigenic upper plate normal fault earthquakes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The deep roots of subduction megathrusts exhibit aseismic slow slip events, commonly accompanied by tectonic tremor. Observations from exhumed rocks suggest this region of the subduction interface is a shear zone with frictional lenses embedded in a viscous matrix. Here, we use numerical models to explore the transient slip characteristics of finite‐width frictional‐viscous megathrust shear zones. Our model utilizes an invariant, continuum‐based, regularized form of rate‐ and state‐dependent friction (RSF) and simulates earthquakes along spontaneously evolving faults embedded in a 2D heterogeneous continuum. The setup includes two elastic plates bounding a viscoelastoplastic shear zone (subduction interface melange) with inclusions (clasts) of varying distributions and viscosity contrasts with respect to the surrounding weaker matrix. The entire shear zone exhibits the same velocity‐weakening RSF parameters, but the lower viscosity matrix has the capacity to switch between RSF and viscous creep as a function of local stress state. Results demonstrate a mechanism in which stress heterogeneity in these shear zones both (a) sets the “speed limit” for earthquake ruptures that nucleate in clasts such that they propagate at slow velocities; and (b) permits the transmission of slow slip from clast to clast, allowing slow ruptures to propagate substantial distances over the model domain. For reasonable input parameters, modeled events have moment‐duration statistics, stress drops, and rupture propagation rates that overlap with some natural slow slip events. These results provide new insights into how geologic observations from ancient analogs of the slow slip source may scale up to match geophysical constraints on modern slow slip phenomena.",

Integration across pelagic and benthic life stages revealed increased population‐level vulnerability to each stressor by 2100 under RCP 8.5. Under future conditions, chronic vulnerability to low pH emerged year‐round for all life stages, whereas vulnerability to low oxygen continued to be acute, developing seasonally and impacting adults, which are critical to population growth.

Using high‐resolution magnetic field imaging to isolate the magnetization of individual grain assemblages, we find that only Fe‐sulfides carry a coherent magnetization. Combined with rock magnetic analyses, we conclude that Allende carries a magnetization acquired during parent body chemical alteration at ~3.0–4.2 My after calcium aluminum‐rich inclusions in an &gt;40 µT magnetic field. This early age strongly favors a magnetic field of nebular origin instead of dynamo or solar wind alternatives. When compared to other paleomagnetic data from meteorites, this strong intensity supports a central role for magnetic instabilities in disk accretion and the presence of temporal variations or spatial heterogeneities in the disk, such as ring and gap structures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The evolution of Earth's climate over geological timescales is linked to surface erosion via weathering of silicate minerals and burial of organic carbon. However, methodological difficulties in reconstructing erosion rates through time and feedbacks among tectonics, climate, and erosion spurred an ongoing debate on mountain erosion sensitivity to tectonic and climate forcing. At the heart of this debate is the question of whether late Cenozoic climate cooling has increased global erosion rates or not. The Himalaya plays a prominent role in this debate as its erosion produces a large fraction of global sediments delivered to ocean basins. We report a 6‐Myr‐long record of ‐derived erosion rates from the north‐western Himalaya, which indicates that erosion rates in this region varied quasi‐cyclically with a period of ∼1 Myr and increased gradually toward the present. We hypothesize that the observed pattern of erosion rates occurred in response to the tectonic growth of the Himalaya by punctuated basal and frontal accretion of rocks from the underthrusting Indian plate and concomitant changes in topography. In this scenario, basal accretion episodically changes rock‐uplift patterns, which brings landscapes out of equilibrium and results in quasi‐cyclic variations in erosion rates. We used numerical landscape evolution simulations to demonstrate that this hypothesis is physically plausible. We attribute the long‐term increase in erosion rates to the erosional response of topography due to frequent basal accretion relative to frontal accretion. Because tectonic accretion processes are inherent to collisional orogenesis, they likely confound climatic interpretations of erosion rate histories.",

Here, we monitored emissions from 20 peatland lakes across a 1,600 km permafrost transect in boreal western Canada. Contrary to expectations, we observed a shift from source to sink of CO 2 for lakes warmer regions, driven by greater primary productivity associated with greater hydrological connectivity to lakes and nutrient availability in the absence of permafrost. Conversely, an 8‐fold increase in CH 4 emissions in warmer regions was associated with water temperature and shifts in microbial communities and dominant anaerobic processes. Our results suggest that the net radiative forcing from altered greenhouse gas emissions of northern peatland lakes this century will be dominated by increasing CH 4 emissions and only partially offset by reduced CO 2 emissions.",

Emission inventories generated through surface activity measurements are reported annually or bi‐annually, and evaluated periodically through a “Global Stocktake.” Emissions inverted from atmospheric data support evaluation of reported inventories, but their systematic use is stifled by spatially variable biases from prior errors combined with limited sensitivity of observations to emissions (also called smoothing error), as‐well‐as poorly characterized information content. Here, we demonstrate a Bayesian, optimal estimation (OE) algorithm for evaluating a state‐of‐the‐art inventory (EDGAR v6.0) using satellite‐based emissions from 2009 to 2018. The OE algorithm quantifies the information content (uncertainty reduction, sectoral attribution, spatial resolution) of the satellite‐based emissions and disentangles the effect of smoothing error when comparing to an inventory. We find robust differences between satellite and EDGAR for total livestock, rice, and coal emissions: 14 ± 9, 12 ± 8, −11 ± 6 Tg CH 4 /yr respectively. EDGAR and satellite agree that livestock emissions are increasing (0.25–1.3 Tg CH 4 /yr/yr), primarily in the Indo‐Pakistan region, sub‐tropical Africa, and the Southern Brazilian; East Asia rice emissions are also increasing, highlighting the importance of agriculture on the atmospheric methane growth rate. In contrast, low information content for the waste and fossil emission trends confounds comparison between EDGAR and satellite; increased sampling and spatial resolution of satellite observations are therefore needed to evaluate reported changes to emissions in these sectors.",

We investigate the S x of the marine boundary layer clouds by combining airborne and surface observations in the Eastern North Atlantic. The cloud droplet number concentration ( N c ) in the least diluted cloud cores agrees well with the number concentration of particles larger than the Hoppel Minimum (HM) ( N &gt;HM ) below clouds, indicating that the HM represents the average size threshold above which particles are activated to form cloud droplets. The S x values derived from surface observations vary from 0.10% to 0.50% from June 2017 to June 2018, with a clear seasonal variation exhibiting higher values during winter. Most of the S x variance (∼60%) can be explained by the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration and updraft velocity ( w ), with the CCN concentration playing a more important role than w in explaining the variation of S x . The influence of CCN concentration on S x leads to a buffered response of N c to aerosol perturbations. The response of N c to low aerosol concentration during winter is further buffered by the high w . The global Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulated S x values in the Azores have a positive bias compared to measured S x , likely due to overestimated w and underestimated CCN concentration. The CESM simulated S x exhibits higher values further north over the North Atlantic Ocean, which is attributed to stronger w . The suppression of S x by aerosol is also evident in regions with high CCN concentrations.",

Importantly, the annular modes comprise the primary mode of AR variability over the last ∼1,000 years.

Many proposed CDR pathways involve the placement of vast quantities of organic carbon (biomass) on the seafloor in some form, but little is known about their potential biogeochemical impacts, especially at scales relevant for global climate. Here, we evaluate the potential impacts and durability of organic carbon storage specifically within deep anoxic basins, where organic matter (OM) is remineralized through anaerobic processes that may enhance its storage efficiency. We present simple biogeochemical and mixing models to quantify the scale of potential impacts of large‐scale OM addition to the abyssal seafloor in the Black Sea, Cariaco Basin, and the hypersaline Orca Basin. These calculations reveal that the Black Sea in particular may have the potential to accept biomass storage at climatically relevant scales with moderate changes to the geochemical state of abyssal water and limited communication of that impact to surface water. Still, all of these systems would require extensive further evaluation prior to consideration of megatonne‐scale CO 2 sequestration. Many key unknowns remain, including the partitioning of breakdown among sulfate‐reducing and methanogenic metabolisms and the fate of methane in the environment. Given the urgency of responsible CDR development and the potential for anoxic basins to reduce ecological risks to animal communities, efforts to address knowledge gaps related to microbial kinetics, benthic processes, and physical mixing in these systems are critically needed.",

We also assess underlying trends in the frequency of drought classifications across the U.S. Our analysis suggests that the frequency of drought class occurrence is exceeding the threshold percentiles defined by the USDM in a number of regions in the United States, particularly in the American West, where the last 23 years have emerged as a prolonged dry period. These trends are also reflected in percentile‐based thresholds in precipitation, runoff, SM, TWS, VPD, and temperature. Our results emphasize that while the USDM appears to be accurately reflecting observed nonstationarity in the physical climate, such trends raise critical questions about whether and how drought diagnosis, classification, and monitoring should address long‐term intervals of wet and dry periods or trends.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hydration of the subduction zone forearc mantle wedge influences the downdip distribution of seismicity, the availability of fluids for arc magmatism, and Earth's long term water cycle. Reconstructions of present‐day subduction zone thermal structures using time‐invariant geodynamic models indicate relatively minor hydration, in contrast to many geophysical and geologic observations. We pair a dynamic, time‐evolving thermal model of subduction with phase equilibria modeling to investigate how variations in slab and forearc temperatures from subduction infancy through to maturity contribute to mantle wedge hydration. We find that thermal state during the intermediate period of subduction, as the slab freely descends through the upper mantle, promotes extensive forearc wedge hydration. In contrast, during early subduction the forearc is too hot to stabilize hydrous minerals in the mantle wedge, while during mature subduction, slab dehydration dominantly occurs beyond forearc depths. In our models, maximum wedge hydration during the intermediate phase is 60%–70% and falls to 20%–40% as quasi‐steady state conditions are approached during maturity. Comparison to global forearc H 2 O capacities reveals that consideration of thermal evolution leads to an order of magnitude increase in estimates for current extents of wedge hydration and provides better agreement with geophysical observations. This suggests that hydration of the forearc mantle wedge represents a potential vast reservoir of H 2 O, on the order of 3.4–5.9 × 10 21 g globally. These results provide novel insights into the subduction zone water cycle, new constraints on the mantle wedge as a fluid reservoir and are useful to better understand geologic processes at plate margins.",

Both GEOS‐Chem simulations and observations show that globally, τ buff is long enough (days) to sustain sulfate production over most populated regions, where the acidification of aerosol water is counteracted by the strong buffering effect of NH 4 + /NH 3 .

    "abstract": "Abstract Landslide susceptibility maps are fundamental tools for risk reduction, but the coarse resolution of current continental‐scale models is insufficient for local application. Complex relations between topographic and environmental attributes characterizing landslide susceptibility at local scales are not transferrable across areas without landslide data. Existing maps with multiple susceptibility classifications under‐represent landslide potential in moderate and gently sloping terrain. We leverage an extensive landslide database ( N = 613,724), a high‐resolution digital elevation model (10‐m), and high‐performance computing resources, to develop a new nationwide susceptibility map for the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. We calculate four alternative linear and nonlinear thresholds of topographic slope and relief using an objective split‐sample calibration. We down‐sample our results to a 90‐m grid to account for uncertainty in the digital elevation model and landslide position, and evaluate these thresholds' ability to differentiate areas of greater susceptibility. The less conservative nonlinear model optimally balances our priorities of capturing observed landslides (99%) while minimizing area covered by susceptible terrain (43%). Independent evaluation with four statewide landslide inventories ( N = 172,367) reinforces our model selection but highlights spatially variable performance. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to susceptibility classification using the concentration of landslide‐prone terrain within each down‐sampled grid. While landslides are possible within any cells containing susceptible terrain, those with the highest concentration capture the majority of observed landslides. Our new map characterizes landside susceptibility more consistently than prior models; our transparent classification approach also provides flexibility for accommodating different tolerances in risk reduction measures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Since the 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR5) an extended concept of the energetic analysis of climate change including forcings, feedbacks and adjustment processes has become widely adopted. Adjustments are defined as processes that occur in response to the introduction of a climate forcing agent, but that are independent of global‐mean surface temperature changes. Most considered are the adjustments that impact the Earth energy budget and strengthen or weaken the instantaneous radiative forcing due to the forcing agent. Some adjustment mechanisms also impact other aspects of climate not related to the Earth radiation budget. Since AR5 and a following description by Sherwood et al. (2015, https://doi.org/10.1175/bams‐d‐13‐00167.1 ), much research on adjustments has been performed and is reviewed here. We classify the adjustment mechanisms into six main categories, and discuss methods of quantifying these adjustments in terms of their potentials, shortcomings and practicality. We furthermore describe aspects of adjustments that act beyond the energetic framework, and we propose new ideas to observe adjustments or to make use of observations to constrain their representation in models. Altogether, the problem of adjustments is now on a robust scientific footing, and better quantification and observational constraint is possible. This allows for improvements in understanding and quantifying climate change.",

Comparing Landsat imagery from subsequent years, we documented temporal and spatial variation in the occurrence of large (≥30 ha) windthrows across the Amazon basin from 1985 to 2020. Over 33 individual years, we detected 3179 large windthrows. Windthrow density was greatest in the central and western Amazon regions, with ∼33% of all events occurring in ∼3% of the monitored area. Return intervals for large windthrows in the same location of these “hotspot” regions are centuries to millennia, while over the rest of the Amazon they are &gt;10,000 years. Our data demonstrate a nearly 4‐fold increase in windthrow number and affected area between 1985 (78 windthrows and 6,900 ha) and 2020 (264 events and 32,170 ha), with more events of &gt;500 ha size since 1990. Such extremely large events (&gt;500 ha up to 2,543 ha) are responsible for interannual variation in the overall median (84 ± 5.2 ha; ±95% CI) and mean (147 ± 13 ha) windthrow area, but we did not find significant temporal trends in the size distribution of windthrows with time. Our results document increased damage from convective storms over the past 40 years in the Amazon, filling a gap in temporal records for tropical regions. Our publicly accessible large windthrow database provides a valuable tool for exploring dynamic conditions leading to damaging storms and their ecological impact on Amazon forests.",

    "abstract": "Human activity influence Earth's environment, including the space environment hundreds to thousands of kilometers above the Earth. One direct evidence is that the 19.8 kHz electromagnetic signals launched by the North West Cape (NWC) transmitter station in Australia produce a wisp-like energy distribution of precipitating energetic electrons in Earth's inner radiation belt, observed by many Low Earth Orbiting satellites. Typically, satellites observe a single wisp with energy that decreases with increasing L (approximately the radial distance in the equatorial plane), which is produced by a first-order cyclotron resonance of transmitter signals with energetic electrons. Here we report, for the first time, multiple wisps observed by the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment-2 (REPTile-2) on board the recently launched Colorado Inner Radiation Belt Experiment (CIRBE) CubeSat. Based on simulation results, we demonstrate that harmonic cyclotron resonances including the 1, -1, and 2 orders by highly oblique NWC transmitter signals produce these multiple wisps. The discovery of multiple-order cyclotron resonances simultaneously occurring in space sheds new light on wave-particle interactions in near-Earth space. It also has implications for developing artificial radiation belt remediation techniques and understanding the propagation and scattering of plasma waves in planetary magnetospheres.",

In addition to the inherent difficulty in identifying signals in noisy data, detection and attribution studies generally rely on general circulation models, which may fail to accurately capture the characteristics of naturally forced and internal hydroclimate variability. Here, we use a long tree‐ring based paleoclimate record of drought to estimate pre‐industrial variability in the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), a commonly used metric of drought risk. Using a Bayesian framework, we estimate the temporal and spatial characteristics of hydroclimate variability prior to 1850. We assess whether observed twenty‐first century PDSI is compatible with this pre‐industrial variability or is better explained by a forced response that scales with the global mean temperature. Our results suggest that global warming likely contributed to dry PDSI in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and Arctic Russia and to wet PDSI in Northern Europe, East‐central Asia, and Tibet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Congestus clouds, characterized by their vertical extent into the middle troposphere, are widespread in tropical regions and play an important role in Earth's climate system. However, fundamental questions regarding their formation and prevalence remain unanswered. Here, we endeavor to answer how congestus cloud tops form by detraining preferentially at altitudes between 5 and 6 km and why this detraining outflow is invigorated by drier mid‐tropospheric conditions. We construct a clear‐sky radiative‐convective framework of congestus cloud‐top formation that is grounded in the discovery of an important spectroscopic property of water vapor. In this mass‐ and energy‐conserving framework, convective detrainment maximizes at a height of 5 and 6 km due to a swift decline in radiative cooling in clear‐sky regions. This decline is, in turn, a consequence of water vapor spectroscopy: more specifically, a drop in the number of strong absorption lines in the water vapor rotation band. In a simple spectral model, we link this spectroscopic property to the shape of the rotation band, which can be approximated as the product of a power law and a sine wave representing the band's deviation from statistical log‐linearity. The characteristic “C”‐shaped relative humidity profile in the tropics further strengthens the outflow in drier mid‐level conditions by amplifying vertical decreases in the clear‐sky cooling rate. Essential to this process are strong RH gradients, which are most pronounced under the driest conditions and induce a vertical decrease in the optical depth lapse rate across the mid‐troposphere.",

We present new fluvial incision‐rate histories and terrain analyses of the Colorado River system through the central Colorado Plateau to understand what has caused the variable erosion across this post‐orogenic landscape. Results from new cosmogenic and luminescence dating of fluvial terrace and upland gravel deposits in Glen and Meander Canyons establish incision‐rate histories that are marked by an Early‐Middle Pleistocene erosion hiatus, followed by ∼200 m of rapid incision over the last ∼350 kyr. Projection of fluvial topography from above knickzones of the Colorado River drainage system roughly agree with the observed magnitude of recent incision and reflect a common baselevel fall from Pliocene river integration through Grand Canyon, which is still propagating through the drainage. A response‐time model indicates that baselevel fall from integration likely took 2–4 Myr to reach the central Colorado Plateau and 100s kyr to travel across the study area, potentially accounting for incision rate changes in the fluvial terrace records of Meander and Glen Canyons. The upstream‐migrating incision has likely been partitioned into multiple waves across the landscape due to the local geologic controls of lava damming, salt tectonics, and heterogenous bedrock. As baselevel fall from Pliocene Colorado River integration diffuses upstream, it can only account for perhaps a quarter of the total ∼2 km of exhumation in the central Colorado Plateau, demanding an unknown driver for significant erosion in the Pliocene.",

Measuring changes in surface wave moveout with ambient noise cross‐correlation, we observe up to 2% changes in Rayleigh wave phase velocity following eruptions in the peninsula's 2023–2024 sequence that are likely associated with magmatic intrusions into the eruption‐feeding dike. We apply a Bayesian inversion to compute the posterior distribution of potential dike opening models for each eruption by considering measurements for varying channel pairs and frequency bands, and assuming this velocity change is tied to volumetric strain associated with dike‐opening. Our results are in agreement with those based on geodetic measurement and provide independent constraints on the depth of the dike, demonstrating the viability of this novel inversion and new volcano monitoring directions through fiber sensing.",

Brittle tremor patches embedded in the ductile matrix deforming aseismically is the most common concept for the fault structure, but whether tremors and their patches impact the SSE initiation is under debate. This study focuses on 13 initiations of major Cascadia ETS. Limited observational constraints exist on the details of ETS initiation because spatiotemporal SSE inversions usually over‐smooth their temporal evolution. Scrutinizing tremors and SSE at the beginning of major ETS events gives us insights into their mechanical relationship. We directly retrieve the temporal evolution of the SSE moment by stacking sub‐daily Global Positioning System (GPS) time series at multiple sites, without slip inversions. Comparison of the GPS stack with tremor count demonstrates that SSE moment release accelerates drastically 1 day after the onset of vigorous tremor activity. On the other hand, once the SSE moment release accelerates, the tremor area expands more rapidly, suggesting that the growth of the ETS occurs through a feedback mechanism between slip and tremor once the SSE is well developed. By combining these and previous observations, we propose a conceptual model of ETS initiation: heterogeneous interface strength limits the growth of SSE with unruptured tremor patches acting as relatively high‐strength pins contributing to this heterogeneity. In other words, major ETS emerges probably only when collective tremor patches are critically stressed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Droughts over the last century in Southwestern North America (SWNA) have had severe consequences for people and ecosystems across the region, most recently during the early 21st‐century megadrought (2000–2022). The 20 th century, however, was bracketed by two extended pluvials that also had significant impacts in the region. We use a 1,224 years (800–2023 CE) record of observed and reconstructed soil moisture, in concert with a paleoclimate reanalysis product, to place the 20th‐century pluvials in a longer‐term context and investigate the occurrence and dynamics of similar events in the Common Era. Analyses of the soil moisture reconstruction demonstrate that pluvials and megapluvials are as ubiquitous as droughts and megadroughts over the last millennium. The early (19 years; 1905–1923) and late (22 years; 1978–1999) 20th‐century pluvials rank as the second and first wettest in the record, respectively, positioning these as events on par with the most extreme megadroughts. Pluvials show a strong association with tropical Pacific (warm) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the 20 th century and over the prior millennium, though the role of the tropical Atlantic is much more uncertain and ambiguous. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach trained on the pre‐industrial period (800–1849 CE), we find that the record setting late 20 th ‐century megapluvial likely occurred as a consequence of anomalously strong Pacific sea surface temperature forcing. This work establishes pluvial and megapluvial events as intrinsic components of Common Era hydroclimate variability in SWNA, comparable in importance to droughts and megadroughts.",

Since 2005, Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy) has experienced accelerating ground uplift, seismicity rates, and degassing. Here we conduct petrological and 4D X‐ray microtomography investigations on cored rocks from a ∼3 km deep geothermal well located near the center of caldera, complemented by 3D high‐resolution seismic tomography. At a depth of ∼2.5–3.0 km we identify the transition to a weak tuff layer likely to trap magmatic fluids. Simulations of magma pathways indicate that stresses generated by caldera unloading may have arrested at the limestone/tuff transition past ascending dykes, which deformed, heated, and released magmatic fluids, deteriorating the surrounding rocks. This weak layer may play a crucial role in building up overpressure, causing deformation and seismicity, thus influencing the dynamics of recent unrests, and possible future magma ascent episodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The co‐occurrence of multiple hazards is of growing concern globally as the frequency and magnitude of extreme climate events increases. Despite studies examining the spatial distribution of such events, there has been little work in examining if all relevant life threatening and damaging hazards are captured in existing hazard databases and by common hazard metrics. For example, local/regional flash flooding events are seldom captured by optical satellite instruments and are subsequently excluded from global hazard databases. Similarly, the heat hazard definitions most frequently used in multi‐hazard studies inherently fail to capture events that are life‐threatening but climatologically within an expected range. Our goal is to determine the potential for increasing multi‐hazard event detection capabilities by inferring additional hazard footprints from widely accessible satellite data. We use daily precipitation and temperature satellite data to develop an open‐source framework that infers additional hazard footprints that are not included in traditional methods. With the state of Texas as our study area, we detected 2.5 times as many flood hazards, equivalent to $320 million in property and crop damages. Furthermore, our expanded heat hazard definition increases the impacted area by 56.6%, equivalent to 91.5 million over an 18 year period.

Having more complete data sets of all relevant hazard extents improves our ability to track global trends and more accurately determine the magnitude of hazard exposure inequities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Amazon has experienced extensive deforestation in recent decades, causing substantial impacts on local and regional climate. However, the precipitation response to this recent forest cover change remains unclear. Here, we examined biophysical effects of forest cover change in the Brazilian Amazon on dry season precipitation using a regional coupled climate model with embedded water vapor tracers. We find that the 3.2% mean reduction in forest cover that occurred in Rondônia and Mato Grosso during 2002–2015 caused a 3.5 ± 0.8% reduction in evapotranspiration and a 5.4 ± 4.4% reduction in precipitation. The reduction in evapotranspiration warmed and dried the lower atmosphere reducing convection and precipitation. Reductions in incoming moisture, dominated by reduced moisture inflow in the mid‐troposphere, accounted for 25% of the total reduction in moisture and amplified the precipitation response to forest loss. The reduction in precipitation efficiency explains 84.5% of the reduction in precipitation with the remainder due to reductions in precipitable water. The reduced precipitation sourced from water vapor inflow accounts for 76.9% of the simulated precipitation reduction, with the remaining 23.1% due to reduced local evapotranspiration. Our study demonstrates substantial reductions in dry season precipitation due to recent forest cover change in the Amazon, highlighting the importance of atmospheric responses to land cover change in this region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An issue of global concern is how climate change forcing is transmitted to ecosystems. Forest ecosystems in mountain landscapes may demonstrate buffering and perhaps decoupling of long‐term rates of temperature change, because vegetation, topography, and local winds (e.g., cold air pooling) influence temperature and potentially create microclimate refugia (areas which are relatively protected from climate change). We tested these ideas by comparing 45‐year regional rates of air temperature change to unique temporal and spatial air temperature records in the understory of regionally representative stable old forest at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. The 45‐year seasonal patterns and rates of warming were similar throughout the forested landscape and matched regional rates observed at 88 standard meteorological stations in Oregon and Washington, indicating buffering, but not decoupling of long‐term climate change rates. Consideration of the energy balance explains these results: while shading and airflows produce spatial patterns of temperature, these processes do not counteract global increases in air temperature driven by increased downward, longwave radiation forced by increased anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In some months, the 45‐year warming in the forest understory equaled or exceeded spatial differences of air temperature between the understory and the canopy or canopy openings and was comparable to temperature change over 1,000 m elevation, while in other months there has been little change. These findings have global implications because they indicate that microclimate refugia are transient, even in this forested mountain landscape.",

Prescribed (“Rx”) fire is often proposed to mitigate future wildfires, but treatments remain limited, and few studies quantify their effectiveness on recent major wildfires. We investigate the effects of Rx fire treatments on subsequent burn severity across western US ecoregions and particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) emissions in California. Using high‐resolution (30‐m) satellite imagery, land management records, and fire emissions data, we employ a quasi‐experimental design to compare Rx fire‐treated areas with adjacent untreated areas to estimate the impacts of recent Rx fires (Fall 2018–Spring 2020) on the extreme 2020 wildfire season. We find that within 2020 wildfire burn areas where Rx fires were used prior to 2020, burn severity changed by −16% ( p &lt; 0.001) and smoke PM 2.5 emissions changed by −101 kg per acre ( p &lt; 0.1). Rx fires in the wildland‐urban interface (“WUI”) were less effective in reducing burn severity and smoke PM 2.5 emissions than those outside the WUI. Overall, Rx fires led to a net reduction of −14% in PM 2.5 emissions, including those from the Rx fires themselves. The proposed policy of treating one million acres annually in California could reduce smoke emissions by 655,000 tons over the next 5 years, equivalent to 52% of the emissions from 2020 wildfires. Our analysis provides comprehensive estimates of the net benefits of Rx fire on subsequent burn severity and smoke PM 2.5 emissions in the western US, an empirical basis for evaluating proposed Rx fire expansions, and valuable constraints for future modeling.",

Whereas the equatorward auroral undulation (EAU) has been frequently observed and well known, the poleward auroral undulation (PAU) has never been observed yet. Both EAU and PAU were found in the N 2 LBHL (165–180 nm, mostly due to electron precipitation) and Lyman α 121.6 nm (due to proton precipitation) images acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft. The spatial amplitude and wavelength of the PAU reached ∼900 km. During the PAU crossing, DMSP observed both precipitating electrons and ions (protons) and a plasma drift up to ∼5,000 m/s with a strong shear. Simultaneous ground‐based all‐sky imaging at South Pole captured the dynamic behavior of the PAU that propagated in an anti‐sunward direction at a phase speed of ∼250 m/s. The solar wind conditions during the PAU were a high solar wind speed (∼700 km/s), an intense southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF, approximately −40 nT), and a high density (37 cm −3 ). These upstream conditions suggest that the generation of PAU is likely due to giant Kelvin‐Helmholtz waves on the magnetopause for southward IMF.",

The order replaces the scientific experts who lead U.S. governmental scientific organizations with non‐scientific political appointees who would have the power to decide what science could and could not be published. In doing so, the executive order threatens to reverse more than 80 years of scientific advancements that have given the U.S. its world‐leading military, technology, and economy. The justifications provided in the executive order for this change in policy are false or misleading in their assessment and representation of the current state of U.S. scientific scholarship. Hypocritical in its aims, the executive order claims to promote integrity in science while at the same time calling to remove the “Framework for Federal Scientific Integrity Policy and Practice” that currently ensure veracity and credibility in science. The executive order is also unconstitutional, threatening to take away the First Amendment rights of scientists by punishing them if they publish truthful and accurate science that is contrary to the administration's political agenda. Such censorship of scientists has been attempted by failed governments of the past such as Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and early communist China, always with disastrous consequences for their citizens. “Restoring Gold Standard Science” needs to be rescinded to avoid catastrophic consequences for the U.S. economy and national security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Auroral forms are like fingerprints linking optical features to physical phenomena in the near‐Earth space. While discovering new forms is rare, recently, scientists reported of citizens' observations of STEVE, a pinkish optical manifestation of subauroral ionospheric drifts that were not thought to be visible to the naked eye. Here, we present a new auroral form named “the dunes”. On 7 October 2018, citizen observers took multiple digital photographs of the same dunes simultaneously from different locations in Finland and Sweden. We develop a triangulation method to analyze the photographs and conclude that the dunes are a monochromatic wave field with a wavelength of about 45 km within a thin layer at 100 km altitude. Supporting data suggest that the dunes manifest atmospheric waves, possibly mesospheric bores, which are rarely detected, and have not previously been observed via diffuse aurora nor at auroral latitudes and altitudes. The dunes present a new opportunity to investigate the coupling of the lower/middle atmosphere to the thermosphere and ionosphere. Our paper adds to the growing body of work that illustrates the value of citizen scientist images in carrying out quantitative analysis of optical phenomena, especially at small scales at subauroral latitudes. Further, the dune project presents means to create general interest toward physics, emphasizing that citizens can take part in scientific work by helping to uncover new phenomena.",

In this study, to reduce uncertainties in such hazard estimates, we present a new method that uses empirical data from precariously balanced rocks (PBRs) in coastal Central California. We calculate the probability of toppling of each PBR at defined ground‐motion levels and determine the age at which the PBRs obtained their current fragile geometries using a novel implementation of cosmogenic 10 Be exposure dating. By eliminating the PSHA estimates inconsistent with at least a 5% probability of PBR survival, the mean ground‐motion estimate corresponding to the hazard level of 10 −4 yr −1 (10,000 yr mean return period) is significantly reduced by 27%, and the range of estimated 5th–95th fractile ground motions is reduced by 49%. Such significant reductions in uncertainties make it possible to more reliably assess the safety and security of critical infrastructure in earthquake‐prone regions worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Himalayan mountain range produces one of the steepest and largest rainfall gradients on Earth, with &gt;3 m/yr rainfall difference over a ∼100 km distance. The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) contributes more than 80% to the annual precipitation budget of the central Himalayas. The remaining 20% falls mainly during pre‐ISM season. Understanding the seasonal cycle and the transfer pathways of moisture from precipitation to the rivers is crucial for constraining water availability in a warming climate. However, the partitioning of moisture into the different storage systems such as snow, glacier, and groundwater and their relative contribution to river discharge throughout the year remains under‐constrained. Here, we present novel field data from the Kali Gandaki, a trans‐Himalayan river, and use 4‐year time series of river and rain water stable isotope composition (δ 18 O and δ 2 H values) as well as river discharge, satellite Global Precipitation Measurement amounts, and moisture source trajectories to constrain hydrological variability. We find that rainfall before the onset of the ISM is isotopically distinct and that ISM rain and groundwater have similar isotopic values. Our study lays the groundwork for using isotopic measurements to track changes in precipitation sources during the pre‐ISM to ISM transition in this key region of orographic precipitation. Specifically, we highlight the role of pre‐ISM precipitation, derived from the Gangetic plain, to define the seasonal river isotopic variability across the central Himalayas. Lastly, isotopic values across the catchment document the importance of a large well‐mixed groundwater reservoir supplying river discharge, especially during the non‐ISM season.",

We present a theory for the water balance to predict the fractional change in streamflow due to given fractional changes in temperature and precipitation. The theory involves a single parameter whose value is derived under the conditions of neither energy‐ nor water‐limitations and, therefore, is not an adjustable parameter. By comparison with extensive data for precipitation elasticity ϵ p at global scale, we find that the theory captures the key trends of the variations of the median value of ϵ p with the aridity index A I . In contrast to a shortcoming of the classical Budyko phenomenology, namely, convergence to ϵ p = 4 for large A I , our theory yields a value of 2 for the median value of ϵ p for all A I &gt; 1, in accord with the data for major river basins, as well as with the median value of summaries of global and continental data sets. Incorporating in the theory the effects of annual changes in water storage leads to the ability to predict the range of observed values of the elasticity as a function of the aridity index, or its inverse, the humidity index, as well as the run‐off ratio. When changes in storage are neglected, the theory yields more accurate predictions for major river drainages than for small watersheds, particularly if the large basin spans various climate regimes and, as such, an integration over climates tends to reduce relative changes in the storage.",

Here we argue that torques applied by the underlying ocean are also important and can result in non‐synchronous rotation. The resulting spin rate can be slightly slower than the synchronous angular rate that would have kept the same point of the ice shell facing Jupiter. We develop an ice shell rotation model, driven by ocean stress calculated using a high‐resolution state‐of‐the‐art ocean general circulation model, and take into account the viscoelastic deformation of the ice shell. We use the ice shell model results together with observed limits on the ice shell drift speed to constrain ice shell parameters such as effective viscosity, which is currently uncertain by at least four orders of magnitude. Our results suggest, at best, sluggish ice shell convection. Depending on the relaxation time scale of the ice shell and on the ocean currents, the ice shell may exhibit negligible drift, constant drift, or oscillatory drift superimposed on random fluctuations. The expected rotation rate exceeds ∼30 m/yr; future spacecraft observations can be used to test these predictions and yield insight into the properties of the ice shell and underlying ocean.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While enhanced tree growth over the last decades has been reported in forests across the globe, it remains unclear whether it drives persistent biomass increases of forest stands, particularly in mature forests. Enhanced tree growth and stand‐level biomass are often linked with a simultaneous increase in density‐driven mortality and a reduction in tree longevity. Identifying empirical evidence regarding the balance between these processes is challenging due to the confounding effects of stand history, management, and environmental changes. Here, we investigate the link between growth and biomass via the negative relationship between average tree size and stand density (tree number per area). We find increasing stand density for a given mean tree size in unmanaged closed‐canopy forests in Switzerland over the past six decades and a positive relationship between tree growth and stand density across forest plots—qualitatively consistent with our simulations using a mechanistic, cohort‐resolving ecosystem model (BiomeE). Model simulations show that, in the absence of other disturbances, enhanced tree growth persistently increases biomass stocks despite simultaneous decreases in carbon residence time and tree longevity. However, the magnitude of simulated biomass changes for a given growth enhancement critically depends on the shape of the mortality functions. Our analyses reconcile reports of growth‐induced reductions of tree longevity with model predictions of persistent biomass increases, and with our finding of trends toward denser forests in response to growth—also in mature stands.",

Using global direct numerical simulations, we investigate the effect of heterogeneous tidal heating in the silicate mantle on rotating thermal convection in the ocean and its consequences on ice shell thickness. Under the assumption of no salinity or ocean‐ice shell feedbacks, we show that convection largely transposes the latitudinal variations of tidal heating from the seafloor to the ice, leading to a higher oceanic heat flux in polar regions. Longitudinal variations are efficiently transferred when boundary‐driven thermal winds develop, but are reduced in the presence of strong zonal flows and may vanish in planetary regimes. If spatially homogeneous radiogenic heating is dominant in the silicate mantle, the ocean's contribution to ice shell thickness variations is negligible compared to tidal heating within the ice. If tidal heating is instead dominant in the mantle, the situation is reversed and the ocean controls the pole‐to‐equator thickness contrast, as well as possible longitudinal variations.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the arrival of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is one key objective of space weather forecasting. In operational space weather forecasting, solar wind numerical models are used for this task and ensemble techniques are being increasingly explored as a means to improve these forecasts. Currently, these forecasts are not constrained by the available in situ and remote sensing observations, such as those from the heliospheric imagers (HIs) on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) STEREO spacecraft, which record white‐light images of solar wind and CMEs. We report case studies of four CMEs and show how HI observations can be used to improve the skill and reduce the uncertainty of ensemble hindcasts of these events. Using a computationally efficient solar wind model, we produce 200‐member ensemble hindcasts, perturbing the modeled CME parameters within uniform distributions about the best estimates. By comparing the trajectory of the modeled CME flanks with HI observations, we compute a weight for each ensemble member. Weighting the ensemble distribution of CME arrival times improves the skill and reduces the hindcast uncertainty of each event. For these four events, the weighted ensembles show a mean reduction in arrival time error of 20.1 ± 4.1 %, and a mean reduction in arrival time uncertainty of 15.0 ± 7.2 %, relative to the unweighted ensembles. This technique could be applied in operational space weather forecasting, if real‐time HI observations were available. Therefore, as NASA and the European Space Agency are currently planning the next space weather monitoring missions, our proof‐of‐concept study provides some evidence of the potential value of including HIs on these missions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hurricanes fundamentally alter the upper ocean thermal structure across millions of square kilometers annually through a medley of complex processes that are not well understood but are critically important to hurricane intensification. High‐resolution, air‐deployed profiling float observations beneath Hurricanes Irma (2017) and Florence (2018) detail storm‐induced changes in upper ocean temperature, salinity, and density structures. This unique and comprehensive data set allows for validation and quantification of results from previous observational and modeling studies, including the time evolution of sea surface cooling and upper ocean near‐inertial oscillations, greater mixed layer deepening right of each storm track, and inhibition of mixing by salinity stratification (beneath Irma). These observations also reveal that storm‐forced upper ocean currents remain remarkably uniform with increasing distance from the radius of maximum winds and result in consistent mixed layer deepening, particularly right of each storm track. These observed ocean mixed layer depth changes are closely approximated by a mixing depth parameterization, which may enhance storm‐forced ocean response predictability and therefore increase hurricane intensity forecast accuracy. Further, these hurricane‐induced upper ocean temperature changes contribute to the evolving nature of hurricanes and ocean heat storage on seasonal and climate time scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Earthquake triggering by seismic waves has been recognized as a phenomenon for nearly 30 years. However, our ability to study dynamic triggering has been limited by our ability to capture the triggering stresses accurately and record the resultant earthquakes. Here we use full waveforms from a dense seismic network and a modern, high‐resolution seismic catalog to measure triggering in Southern California from 2008 to 2017 based on interevent time ratios. We find that the fractional seismicity rate change, which we term triggering intensity or triggerability, as a function of peak strain change for the period of ∼20 s due to distant earthquakes is monotonically increasing and compatible with earlier measurements made with a disjoint data set from 1984 to 2008. A triggering strain of 1 microstrain is equivalent to the local productivity generated by an M 1.8 earthquakes. This result implies that a prediction of seismicity rate changes can be made based on recorded ground shaking using the same formalism as currently used for aftershock prediction. For a teleseismic event, this small level of triggering occurs throughout the region and thus aggregates to a regional effect. We find that the triggering rate decays after the triggerer follows an Omori‐Utsu law, but at a much slower rate than a typical aftershock sequence. The slow decay rate suggests that an ancillary process such as creep or fluid flow must be part of dynamic triggering. The prevalence of triggering in areas of creep or fluid involvement reinforces this inference. A triggering cascade of secondary earthquakes is insufficient to explain the data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In clouds containing both liquid and ice with temperatures between −3°C and −8°C, liquid droplets collide with large ice crystals, freeze, and shatter, producing a plethora of small ice splinters. This process, known as Hallett‐Mossop rime splintering, and other forms of secondary ice production, can cause clouds to reflect less sunlight and to have shorter lifetimes. We show its impact on Southern Ocean shallow cumuli using a novel suite of five global storm‐resolving simulations, which partition the Earth's atmosphere into 2–4 km wide columns. We evaluate simulated clouds and radiation over the Southern Ocean with aircraft observations from the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES), and satellite observations from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Himawari. Simulations with large concentrations of ice crystals in boundary layer clouds, which agree better with SOCRATES observations, have reduced mixed‐phase cumulus cloud cover and weaker shortwave cloud radiative effects (CREs) that are less biased compared with CERES. Using a pair of simulations differing only in their treatment of Hallett‐Mossop rime splintering, we show that including this process increases ice crystal concentrations in cumulus clouds and weakens shortwave CREs over the Southern Ocean by 10 W m −2 . We also demonstrate the key role that global storm‐resolving models can play in detangling the effects of clouds on Earth's climate across scales, making it possible to trace the impact of changes in individual cumulus cloud anvils (10 km 2 ) on the radiative budget of the massive Southern Ocean basin (10 7 km 2 ).",

One poorly constrained component of the respiration demand is the oxygen‐to‐carbon remineralization ratio—the respiration quotient. Currently, multiple biological hypotheses can explain variation in the respiration quotient of organic matter produced in the surface ocean. To test these hypotheses, we directly quantified the particulate respiration quotient in 715 samples along a meridional section of the Atlantic Ocean and compared to previous Pacific Ocean observations. We demonstrate significant regional shifts in the respiration quotient and a two‐basin average of 1.16. Possible diel oscillations were also observed in the respiration quotient. Basin and regional variation in the respiration quotient were positively linked to temperature, N versus P stress, and plankton size structure. These observations suggest a complex regulation of the respiration quotient with important implications for the regional coupling of carbon and oxygen cycling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Snow is critically important to the energy budget, biogeochemistry, ecology, and people of the Arctic. While climate change continues to shorten the duration of the snow cover period, snow mass (the depth of the snow pack) has been increasing in many parts of the Arctic. Previous work has shown that deeper snow can rapidly thaw permafrost and expose the large amounts of ancient (legacy) organic matter contained within it to microbial decomposition. This process releases carbonaceous greenhouse gases but also nutrients, which promote plant growth and carbon sequestration. The net effect of increased snow depth on greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic ecosystems remains uncertain. Here we show that 25 years of snow addition turned tussock tundra, one of the most spatially extensive Arctic ecosystems, into a year‐round source of ancient carbon dioxide. More snow quadrupled the amount of organic matter available to microbial decomposition, much of it previously preserved in permafrost, due to deeper seasonal thaw, soil compaction and subsidence as well as the proliferation of deciduous shrubs that lead to 10% greater carbon uptake during the growing season. However, more snow also sustained warmer soil temperatures, causing greater carbon loss during winter (+200% from October to May) and year‐round. We find that increasing snow mass will accelerate the ongoing transformation of Arctic ecosystems and cause earlier‐than‐expected losses of climate‐warming legacy carbon from permafrost.",

We investigate the spatial and temporal evolutions of fluctuations driven by atmospheric acoustic‐gravity waves (AGWs) and, in particular, the Lamb wave modes in high spatial resolution data sets measured over the Continental United States (CONUS), complemented with data over the Americas and the Pacific. Along with &gt;800 barometer sites, tropospheric observations, and Total Electron Content data from &gt;3,000 receivers, we report detections of volcano‐induced AGWs in mesopause and ionosphere‐thermosphere airglow imagery and Fabry‐Perot interferometry. We also report unique AGW signatures in the ionospheric D‐region, measured using Long‐Range Navigation pulsed low‐frequency transmitter signals. Although we observed fluctuations over a wide range of periods and speeds, we identify Lamb wave modes exhibiting 295–345 m s −1 phase front velocities with correlated spatial variability of their amplitudes from the Earth's surface to the ionosphere. Results suggest that the Lamb wave modes, tracked by our ray‐tracing modeling results, were accompanied by deep fluctuation fields coupled throughout the atmosphere, and were all largely consistent in arrival times with the sequence of eruptions over 8 hr. The ray results also highlight the importance of winds in reducing wave amplitudes at CONUS midlatitudes. The ability to identify and interpret Lamb wave modes and accompanying fluctuations on the basis of arrival times and speeds, despite complexity in their spectra and modulations by the inhomogeneous atmosphere, suggests opportunities for analysis and modeling to understand their signals to constrain features of hazardous events.",

Despite the significant influence exerted by rifting on ice shelf geometry and buttressing, the scarcity of in situ observations of rift propagation contributes considerable uncertainty to understanding rift dynamics. Here, we report the first‐ever seismic recording of a multiple‐kilometer rift propagation event. Remote sensing and seismic recordings reveal that a rift in the Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf extended 10.53 km at a speed of 35.1 m/s, the fastest known ice fracture at this scale. We simulate ocean‐coupled rift propagation and find that the dynamics of water flow within the rift limit the propagation rate, resulting in rupture two orders of magnitude slower than typically predicted for brittle fracture. Using seismic recordings of the elastic waves generated during rift propagation, we estimate that ocean water flows into the rift at a rate of at least 2,300 m 3 /s during rift propagation and causes mixing in the subshelf cavity. Our observations support the hypotheses that large ice shelf rift propagation events are brittle, hydrodynamically limited, and exhibit sensitive coupling with the surrounding ocean.",

Accurately modeling the impact of volcanic‐arc landscapes on the Earth's long‐term carbon cycle requires understanding how climate and physical erosion control weathering fluxes from arc landscapes. We evaluate these controls by examining the covariation of stream solutes, sediment geochemistry, and long‐term physical erosion fluxes inferred from cosmogenic 36 Cl in magnetite in volcanic watersheds in Puerto Rico that span a ca. 15‐fold gradient in specific discharge. Analysis of this data using power‐law relationships demonstrates that CO 2 consumption from arc‐rock weathering in the humid tropics is more strongly limited by physical erosion and the supply of primary minerals to the weathering zone than by temperature or the flux of fresh, chemically reactive waters through the critical zone. However, a positive correlation between long‐term physical erosion fluxes and specific discharge is also observed. This indicates that fresh mineral supply in arc environments may ultimately depend on precipitation rates, which may maintain a coupling between arc‐rock weathering fluxes and climate under principally supply limited weathering conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Permafrost influences 25% of land in the Northern Hemisphere, where it stabilizes the ground beneath communities and infrastructure and sequesters carbon. However, the coevolution of permafrost, river dynamics, and vegetation in Arctic environments remains poorly understood. As rivers meander, they erode the floodplain at cutbanks and build new land through bar deposition, creating sequences of landforms with distinct formation ages. Here we mapped these sequences along the Koyukuk River floodplain, Alaska, analyzing permafrost occurrence, and landform and vegetation types. We used radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to develop a floodplain age map. Deposit ages ranged from modern to 10 ka, with more younger deposits near the modern channel. Permafrost rapidly reached 50% areal extent in all deposits older than 200 years then gradually increased up to ∼85% extent for deposits greater than 4 Kyr old. Permafrost extent correlated with increases in black spruce and wetland abundance, as well as increases in permafrost extent within wetland, and shrub and scrub vegetation classes. We developed an inverse model to constrain permafrost formation rate as a function of air temperature. Permafrost extent initially increased by ∼25% per century, in pace with vegetation succession, before decelerating to &lt;10% per millennia as insulating overbank mud and moss slowly accumulated. Modern permafrost extent on the Koyukuk floodplain therefore reflects a dynamic balance between widespread, time‐varying permafrost formation and rapid, localized degradation due to cutbank erosion that might trigger a rapid loss of permafrost with climatic warming.",

To address this ambiguity, we apply a new seismic array method to analyze PKP waveforms from 58 earthquakes recorded in North America that allows localization of the origin of the PKP precursors at the core‐mantle boundary (CMB). We compare these measurements with high frequency 2.5‐D synthetic predictions showing that the PKP precursors are most likely associated with ultra‐low velocity zone structures beneath the western Pacific and North America. The most feasible scenario to generate ULVZs in both locations is through melting of mid‐ocean ridge basalt in subducted oceanic crust.",

Here, we present a comprehensive petrological and geochemical investigation of the full 183 day eruption that is based on frequent sampling of the eruption. Lavas erupted in the first 45 days displayed significant and sudden changes in geochemistry, followed by lower amplitude fluctuations until the end of the eruption. This variability can be explained by contribution from multiple magma bodies, as best distinguished using Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotope systematics. The lavas display unusual trace element and radiogenic isotope compositions compared to other Icelandic basalts, but are similar to other rare, highly incompatible element enriched lavas on the Reykjanes Peninsula, and thus these lavas may represent a distinct suite of Reykjanes Peninsula basalts. Our geochemical and petrological observations show that numerous, compositionally variable bodies of magma must exist in the lowermost crust or at the crust-mantle boundary. These near-Moho magma bodies transfer magma between one another on timescales as short as days-to-months, but partially crystallize over longer time periods, and periodically inject into the overlying crust.",

Glacial diamictites and dolomicrites comprise (1) reworked detrital clasts similar to preglacial strata in stable isotope composition and petrographic textures and (2) autochthonous dolomicrite with more positive δ 18 O values than those of preglacial dolomites or cooccurring detrital clasts. Mean glacial autochthonous dolomicrite Δ 47 temperatures are 26 ± 10°C (95% CL) cooler than preglacial strata, with four samples &lt;25°C. All dolomite Δ 47 temperatures reflect diagenesis associated with lithification, yet observed stratigraphic and textural Δ 47 temperature differences indicate that this occurred early and only contributes to part of the preserved temperature signal. Alteration trends within populations are consistent with low water/rock ratio diagenesis or partial solid‐state reordering; either possibility supports the likelihood of preserved δ 18 O trends. We postulate that the preserved temperature and δ 18 O differences between low‐latitude preglacial Tonian and synglacial Cryogenian dolomites are an imperfect reflection of primary temperature change and ice sheet expansion.",

    "abstract": "Determining the thickness of the lithosphere in any given setting combines uncertainty in both the observational method and laboratory‐derived understanding of mantle rheology. The many observational and modeling criteria across geophysical subfields for plate thickness lead to significant differences in plate thickness estimates depending on the process of interest, be it seismic wave propagation or relaxation in response to changes in loads—from earthquakes, ice sheets to volcanoes—or convection. This paper proposes a framework in which to model and interpret upper mantle mechanical structure smoothly across the full spectrum of geophysical timescales. We integrate viscous, elastic, and linear anelastic constitutive models and calculate the mechanical response from convective to seismic wave timescales (i.e., 0 to infinite frequency or, in practice, 10 −15 to 1 Hz). We apply these calculations to 1‐D thermal structures and determine the normalized complex viscosity, a quantity that shows clearly the role of transient creep in weakening rock relative to the associated Maxwell rheology. Using various criteria for the lithosphere‐asthenosphere boundary, we show that the apparent plate thickness will be thicker at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies. Additional calculations for nonlinear Maxwell behavior (dislocation mechanisms) demonstrate significant changes in the apparent plate structure, decreasing the long‐term plate thickness, consistent with observations. Other effects such as dislocation damping (associated with a steady‐state dislocation structure), melt, water, major element composition, and grain size are not included here but, when incorporated into this framework, will significantly change the full‐spectrum plate thickness predictions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An expanded sedimentary section provides an opportunity to elucidate conditions in the nascent Chicxulub crater during the hours to millennia after the Cretaceous‐Paleogene (K‐Pg) boundary impact. The sediments were deposited by tsunami followed by seiche waves as energy in the crater declined, culminating in a thin hemipelagic marlstone unit that contains atmospheric fallout. Seiche deposits are predominantly composed of calcite formed by decarbonation of the target limestone during impact followed by carbonation in the water column. Temperatures recorded by clumped isotopes of these carbonates are in excess of 70°C, with heat likely derived from the central impact melt pool. Yet, despite the turbidity and heat, waters within the nascent crater basin soon became a viable habitat for a remarkably diverse cross section of the food chain. The earliest seiche layers deposited with days or weeks of the impact contain earliest Danian nannoplankton and dinocyst survivors. The hemipelagic marlstone representing the subsequent years to a few millennia contains a nearly monogeneric calcareous dinoflagellate resting cyst assemblage suggesting deteriorating environmental conditions, with one interpretation involving low light levels in the impact aftermath. At the same horizon, microbial fossils indicate a thriving bacterial community and unique phosphatic fossils including appendages of pelagic crustaceans, coprolites and bacteria‐tunneled fish bone, suggesting that this rapid recovery of the base of the food chain may have supported the survival of larger, higher trophic‐level organisms. The extraordinarily diverse fossil assemblage indicates that the crater was a unique habitat in the immediate impact aftermath, possibly as a result of heat and nutrients supplied by hydrothermal activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Optical televiewer borehole logging within a crevassed region of fast‐moving Store Glacier, Greenland, revealed the presence of 35 high‐angle planes that cut across the background primary stratification. These planes were composed of a bubble‐free layer of refrozen ice, most of which hosted thin laminae of bubble‐rich “last frozen” ice, consistent with the planes being the traces of former open crevasses. Several such last‐frozen laminae were observed in four traces, suggesting multiple episodes of crevasse reactivation. The frequency of crevasse traces generally decreased with depth, with the deepest detectable trace being 265 m below the surface. This is consistent with the extent of the warmer‐than‐modeled englacial ice layer in the area, which extends from the surface to a depth of ∼400 m. Crevasse trace orientation was strongly clustered around a dip of 63° and a strike that was offset by 71° from orthogonal to the local direction of principal extending strain. The traces’ antecedent crevasses were therefore interpreted to have originated upglacier, probably ∼8 km distant involving mixed‐mode (I and III) formation. We conclude that deep crevassing is pervasive across Store Glacier, and therefore also at all dynamically similar outlet glaciers. Once healed, their traces represent planes of weakness subject to reactivation during subsequent advection through the glacier. Given their depth, it is highly likely that such traces—particularly those formed downglacier—survive surface ablation to reach the glacier terminus, where they may represent foci for fracture and iceberg calving.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The meridional temperature profile of the upper layers of planetary atmospheres is set through a balance between differential radiative heating by a nearby star, or by intrinsic heat fluxes emanating from the deep interior, and the redistribution of that heat across latitudes by turbulent flows. These flows spontaneously arise through baroclinic instability of the meridional temperature gradients maintained by the forcing. When planetary curvature is neglected, this turbulence takes the form of coherent vortices that mix the meridional temperature profiles. However, the curvature of the planet favors the emergence of Rossby waves and zonal jets that restrict the meridional wandering of the fluid columns, thereby reducing the mixing efficiency across latitudes. A similar situation arises in the ocean, where the baroclinic instability of zonal currents leads to enhanced meridional heat transport by a turbulent flow consisting of vortices and zonal jets. A recent scaling theory for the turbulent heat transport by vortices is extended to include the impact of planetary curvature, in the framework of the two‐layer quasi‐geostrophic beta‐plane model. This leads to a quantitative parameterization providing the meridional temperature profile in terms of the externally imposed heat flux in an idealized model of planetary atmospheres and oceans. In addition, it provides a quantitative prediction for the emergent criticality, that is, the degree of instability in a canonical model of planetary atmosphere or ocean.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Megathrust earthquakes and their associated tsunamis cause some of the worst natural disasters. In addition to earthquakes, a wide range of slip behaviors are present at subduction zones, including slow earthquakes that span multiple orders of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding these events may shed light on the stress or strength conditions of the megathrust fault. Out of all types of slow earthquakes, very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) are most enigmatic because they are difficult to detect reliably, and the physical nature of VLFEs are poorly understood. Here we show three VLFEs in Cascadia that were dynamically triggered by a 2009 Mw 6.9 Canal de Ballenas earthquake in the Gulf of California. The VLFEs likely locate in between the seismogenic zone and the Cascadia episodic tremor and slip (ETS) zone, including one event with a moment magnitude of 5.7. This is the largest VLFE reported to date, causing clear geodetic signals. Our results show that the Cascadia megathrust fault might slip rapidly at some spots in this gap zone, and such a permissible slip behavior has direct seismic hazard implications for coastal communities and perhaps further inland. Further, the observed seismic sources may represent a new class of slip events, whose characteristics do not fit current understandings of slow or regular earthquakes.",

Nevertheless this result is consistent with our model simulations, so do not rule out a positive forcing if reductions in aircraft emissions continue. A relatively small positive global average radiative effect of 21 mW m −2 is estimated if a decrease in aircraft traffic continues, with an average of up to 64 mW m −2 over the area where aviation is most active. We infer from this analysis that the worldwide adoption of biofuel blending in aircraft fuels that lead to smaller soot emissions could lead to a significant change in the microphysical properties of cirrus clouds but a rather small positive radiative effect.",

Corals actively upregulate pH cf relative to seawater to buffer against changes in temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon, which together control Ω cf . Here we assess the buffering capacity of modern and fossil corals from the Galápagos Islands that have been exposed to sub‐optimal conditions, extreme thermal stress, and OA. We demonstrate a significant decline in pH cf and Ω cf since the pre‐industrial era, trends which are exacerbated during extreme warm years. These results suggest that there are likely physiological limits to corals' pH buffering capacity, and that these constraints render marginal reefs particularly susceptible to OA.",

Observations suggest that river discharge and valley‐wall lithology are the main controls on valley width. Yet, current models based on these observations fail to explain the full range of cross‐sectional valley shapes in nature, suggesting hitherto unquantified controls on valley width. In particular, current models cannot explain the existence of paired terrace sequences that form under cyclic climate forcing. Paired river terraces are staircases of abandoned floodplains on both valley sides, and hence preserve past valley widths. Their formation requires alternating phases of predominantly river incision and predominantly lateral planation, plus progressive valley narrowing. While cyclic Quaternary climate changes can explain shifts between incision and lateral erosion, the driving mechanism of valley narrowing is unknown. Here, we extract valley geometries from climatically formed, alluvial river‐terrace sequences and show that across our dataset, the total cumulative terrace height (here: total valley height) explains 90%–99% of the variance in valley width at the terrace sites. This finding suggests that valley height, or a parameter that scales linearly with valley height, controls valley width in addition to river discharge and lithology. To explain this valley‐width‐height relationship, we reformulate existing valley‐width models and suggest that, when adjusting to new boundary conditions, alluvial valleys evolve to a width at which sediment removal from valley walls matches lateral sediment supply from hillslope erosion. Such a hillslope‐channel coupling is not captured in current valley‐evolution models. Our model can explain the existence of paired terrace sequences under cyclic climate forcing and relates valley width to measurable field parameters. Therefore, it facilitates the reconstruction of past climatic and tectonic conditions from valley topography.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Unlike in the high‐latitude North Atlantic, no deep water is formed in the modern subarctic North Pacific. It has previously been suggested that during climate states different from today, this dichotomy did not endure, and the formation of North Pacific Deepwater (NPDW) occurred in the subarctic North Pacific, which supported an active Pacific meridional overturning circulation (PMOC). Here we provide new records of productivity and sedimentary redox conditions from the central subarctic North Pacific spanning the late Miocene to early Pleistocene. These reconstructions indicate greater‐than‐modern and temporally varying North Pacific export production across the interval of ∼2.7–6 Ma. Our time series, combined with previously published data sets and model output for Pliocene North Pacific Ocean dynamics, support the presence of an active PMOC during the Pliocene, and suggest that the characteristics of NPDW formation varied during this warmer interval of Earth's history. This finding of elevated export production at a time of deep water formation presents a conundrum when considering Quaternary North Pacific Ocean dynamics, where subarctic North Pacific productivity declines during intervals when enhanced overturning is posited to occur. We evaluate our data considering the caveats of both (i.e., Pliocene and Quaternary North Pacific circulation) hypotheses, as well as additional mechanisms unrelated to ocean circulation. Because the Pliocene is a possible analogue for near‐future climate, our results and analyses have important ramifications for our understanding of regional and global climate in the coming decades as the planet continues to warm.",

Yet, the full assessment of GHG balance, considering trade‐offs between soil organic carbon (SOC) change and non‐CO 2 GHG emissions, is lacking. Integrating an improved agroecosystem model with a meta‐analysis of multiple field studies, we found that U.S. rice paddies were the rapidly growing net GHG emission sources, increased 138% from 3.7 ± 1.2 Tg CO 2 eq yr −1 in the 1960s to 8.9 ± 2.7 Tg CO 2 eq yr −1 in the 2010s. CH 4 , as the primary contributor, accounted for 10.1 ± 2.3 Tg CO 2 eq yr −1 in the 2010s, alongside a notable rise in N 2 O emissions by 0.21 ± 0.03 Tg CO 2 eq yr −1 . SOC change could offset 14.0% (1.45 ± 0.46 Tg CO 2 eq yr −1 ) of the climate‐warming effects of soil non‐CO 2 GHG emissions in the 2010s. This escalation in net GHG emissions is linked to intensified land use, increased atmospheric CO 2 , higher synthetic nitrogen fertilizer and manure application, and climate change. However, no/reduced tillage and non‐continuous irrigation could reduce net soil GHG emissions by approximately 10% and non‐CO 2 GHG emissions by about 39%, respectively. Despite the rise in net GHG emissions, the cost of achieving higher rice yields has decreased over time, with an average of 0.84 ± 0.18 kg CO 2 eq ha −1 emitted per kilogram of rice produced in the 2010s. The study suggests the potential for significant GHG emission reductions to achieve climate‐friendly rice production in the U.S. through optimizing the ratio of synthetic N to manure fertilizer, reducing tillage, and implementing intermittent irrigation.",

The structure and dynamics of Jupiter's dawnside magnetosphere can be characterized as a competition between internally driven sunward flow and solar wind‐driven tailward flow. During the prime mission, Juno acquired extensive data from dawn to midnight, sampling the magnetodisc and higher latitude regions. Numerical moments from the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE‐I) plasma (ion) instrument revealed a mid‐latitude region of anticorotational (− v ϕ ) flow. While the magnitude of the flow is subject to uncertainty due to low count rates in these rarefied regions, we demonstrate in the raw JADE‐I data that the sign of v ϕ is a robust measurement. Global Grid Agnostic Magnetohydrodyamics for Extended Research Applications simulations show a similar region of strongly reduced flow in proximity to open field lines. Additionally, we use Jupiter Energetic‐particle Detector Instrument integral moments to determine the He n + /H + ratio (where n refers to He + or He ++ ) and show that a transition to solar wind‐like composition occurs in the same region as the anticorotational flow. We conclude that the global simulations are consistent with the Juno data, where the simulations show a crescent of open magnetic flux that is bounded by the magnetodisc and a closed high‐latitude polar region (nominally the polar cap), which is never observed in the terrestrial magnetosphere. The distinct distribution of open flux in Jupiter's dawnside magnetosphere suggests the significance of planetary rotation and may represent a characteristic feature of rotating giant magnetospheres for future exploration.",

Most stomatal optimization models assume that plants instantaneously optimize a reward function such as carbon gain. However, plants are expected to optimize over longer timescales given the rapid environmental variability they encounter. There are currently no observational constraints on these timescales. Here, a new stomatal model is developed and is used to analyze the timescales over which stomatal closure is optimized. The proposed model assumes plants maximize carbon gain subject to the constraint that they cannot draw down soil moisture below a critical value. The reward is integrated over time, after being weighted by a discount factor that represents the timescale ( τ ) that a plant considers when optimizing stomatal conductance to save water. The model is simple enough to be analytically solvable, which allows the value of τ to be inferred from observations of stomatal behavior under known environmental conditions. The model is fitted to eddy covariance data in a range of ecosystems, finding the value of τ that best predicts the dynamics of evapotranspiration at each site. Across 82 sites, the climate metrics with the strongest correlation to τ are measures of the average number of dry days between rainfall events. Values of τ are similar in magnitude to the longest such dry period encountered in an average year. The results here shed light on which climate characteristics shape spatial variations in ecosystem‐level water use strategy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Slow slip events (SSEs) have been observed in spatial and temporal proximity to megathrust earthquakes in various subduction zones, including the 2014 M w 7.3 Guerrero, Mexico earthquake which was preceded by a M w 7.6 SSE. However, the underlying physics connecting SSEs to earthquakes remains elusive. Here, we link 3D slow‐slip cycle models with dynamic rupture simulations across the geometrically complex flat‐slab Cocos plate boundary. Our physics‐based models reproduce key regional geodetic and teleseismic fault slip observations on timescales from decades to seconds. We find that accelerating SSE fronts transiently increase shear stress at the down‐dip end of the seismogenic zone, modulated by the complex geometry beneath the Guerrero segment. The shear stresses cast by the migrating fronts of the 2014 M w 7.6 SSE are significantly larger than those during the three previous episodic SSEs that occurred along the same portion of the megathrust. We show that the SSE transient stresses are large enough to nucleate earthquake dynamic rupture and affect rupture dynamics. However, additional frictional asperities in the seismogenic part of the megathrust are required to explain the observed complexities in the coseismic energy release and static surface displacements of the Guerrero earthquake. We conclude that it is crucial to jointly analyze the long‐ and short‐term interactions and complexities of SSEs and megathrust earthquakes across several (a)seismic cycles accounting for megathrust geometry. Our study has important implications for identifying earthquake precursors and understanding the link between transient and sudden megathrust faulting processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The atmospheric CO 2 growth rate is a fundamental measure of climate forcing. NOAA's growth rate estimates, derived from in situ observations at the marine boundary layer (MBL), serve as the benchmark in policy and science. However, NOAA's MBL‐based method encounters challenges in accurately estimating the whole‐atmosphere CO 2 growth rate at sub‐annual scales. Here we introduce the Growth Rate from Satellite Observations (GRESO) method as a complementary approach to estimate the whole‐atmosphere CO 2 growth rate utilizing satellite data. Satellite CO 2 observations offer extensive atmospheric coverage that extends the capability of the current NOAA benchmark. We assess the sampling errors of the GRESO and NOAA methods using 10 atmospheric transport model simulations. The simulations generate synthetic OCO‐2 satellite and NOAA MBL data for calculating CO 2 growth rates, which are compared against the global sum of carbon fluxes used as model inputs. We find good performance for the NOAA method (R = 0.93, RMSE = 0.12 ppm year −1 or 0.25 PgC year −1 ). GRESO demonstrates lower sampling errors (R = 1.00; RMSE = 0.04 ppm year −1 or 0.09 PgC year −1 ). Additionally, GRESO shows better performance at monthly scales than the NOAA method (R = 0.76 vs. 0.47, respectively). Due to CO 2 's atmospheric longevity, the NOAA method accurately captures growth rates over 5‐year intervals. GRESO's robustness across partial coverage configurations (ocean or land data) shows that satellites can be promising tools for low‐latency CO 2 growth rate information, provided the systematic biases are minimized using in situ observations. Along with accurate and calibrated NOAA in situ data, satellite‐derived growth rates can provide information about the global carbon cycle at sub‐annual scales.",

In soil‐ and sediment‐mantled settings topographic roughness may be framed as a competition between roughening and smoothing processes. In many cases, roughening processes may be specific eco‐hydro‐geomorphic events like shrub deaths, tree uprooting, river avulsions, or impact craters. The smoothing processes are all geomorphic processes that operate at smaller scales and tend to drive a diffusive evolution of the surface. In this article, we present a generalized theory that explains topographic roughness as an emergent property of geomorphic systems (semi‐arid plains, forests, alluvial fans, heavily bombarded surfaces) that are periodically shocked by an addition of roughness which subsequently decays due to the action of all small scale, creep‐like processes. We demonstrate theory for the examples listed above, but also illustrate that there is a continuum of topographic forms that the roughening process may take on so that the theory is broadly applicable. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our theory applies to any geomorphic feature that can be described as a pit or mound, pit‐mound couplet, or mound‐pit‐mound complex.",

However, the field strength in the solar system beyond ∼7 astronomical units (AU) and its role in accretion remain poorly constrained. Returned samples from asteroid (162173) Ryugu offer the possibility of determining the nebular field intensity in this distal region. Here, we report paleomagnetic studies of three Ryugu particles which reveal that alteration occurred in the presence of a null or relatively weak (&lt;15.8 μT) field within 3 million years (Ma) after solar system formation. This resolves previously contrasting reports that Ryugu's parent body experienced alteration in the presence of a strong (&gt;80 μT) magnetic field and weak or null field (&lt;3 μT). In addition, we re‐examine previous paleomagnetic and Mn‐Cr chronometry studies of three other distally‐sourced meteorites, Tagish Lake, Tarda, and Wisconsin Range 91600, which measured paleointensities of &lt;0.9, &lt;1.7 and 5.1 ± 4.5 μT respectively. While it was previously unclear whether these records were acquired while the nebula was present, our re‐analysis suggests that their records are sufficiently old (i.e., &lt;3.5 Ma after solar system formation) to be nebular in origin. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the distal solar system nebular field, while faint, was likely still strong enough to drive accretion at rates like those observed in the inner solar system.",

These reductions have been attributed in part to a shift from coal to natural gas, as gas‐fired plants emit roughly half the CO 2 emissions as coal plants. To date, no analysis has looked at the coal‐to‐gas shift from the perspective of commitment accounting—the cumulative future CO 2 emissions expected from power infrastructure. We estimate that between 2000 and 2018, committed emissions in the U.S. power sector decreased 12% (six GtCO 2 ), from 49 to 43 GtCO 2 , assuming average generator lifetimes and capacity factors. Taking into consideration methane leakage during the life cycle of coal and gas plants, this decrease in committed emissions is further offset (e.g., assuming a 3% leakage rate, there is effectively no reduction at all). Thus, although annual emissions have fallen, cumulative future emissions will not be substantially lower unless existing coal and gas plants operate at significantly lower rates than they have historically. Moreover, our estimates of committed emissions for U.S. coal and gas plants finds steep reductions in plant use and/or early retirements are already needed for the country to meet its targets under the Paris climate agreement—even if no new fossil capacity is added.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Megathrust earthquakes exhibit a ubiquitous seismic radiation style: low‐frequency (LF) seismic energy is efficiently emitted from the shallowest portion of the fault, whereas high‐frequency (HF) seismic energy is efficiently emitted from the deepest part of the fault. Although this is observed in many case‐specific studies, we show that it is ubiquitous in global megathrust earthquakes between 1995 and 2021. Previous studies have interpreted this as an effect of systematic depth variation in either the plate interface frictional properties (Lay et al., 2012) or the P wavespeeds (Sallarès &amp; Ranero, 2019). This work suggests an alternative hypothesis: the interaction between waves and ruptures due to the Earth's free surface is the leading mechanism that generates this behavior. Two‐dimensional dynamic rupture simulations of subduction zone earthquakes support this hypothesis. Our simulations show that the interaction between the seismic waves reflected at the Earth's free surface and the updip propagating rupture results in LF radiation at the source. In contrast, the downdip propagation of rupture is less affected by the free surface and is thus dominated by HF radiation typical of buried faults. To a second degree, the presence of a realistic Earth structure derived from P‐wave velocity (V P ) tomographic images and realistic V P /V S ratio estimated in boreholes further enhances the contrast in source radiation. We conclude that the Earth's free surface is necessary to explain the observed megathrust earthquake radiation style, and the realistic structure of subduction zone is necessary to better predict earthquake ground motion and tsunami potential.",

Visible to near-infrared observations at wavelengths of $<2.5\\ {\\rm \\mu m}$ have suggested a genetic link between outer main belt asteroids located at $2.5$-$4\\ {\\rm au}$ and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites (CCs) that show isotopic similarities to volatile elements on Earth. However, recent longer wavelength data for large outer main belt asteroids show $3.1\\ {\\rm \\mu m}$ absorption features of ammoniated phyllosilicates that are absent in CCs and cannot easily form from materials stable at those present distances. Here, by combining data collected by the AKARI space telescope and hydrological, geochemical, and spectral models of water-rock reactions, we show that the surface materials of asteroids having $3.1\\ {\\rm \\mu m}$ absorption features and CCs can originate from different regions of a single, water-rock-differentiated parent body. Ammoniated phyllosilicates form within the water-rich mantles of the differentiated bodies containing NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ under high water-rock ratios ($>4$) and low temperatures ($<70^\\circ$C). CCs can originate from the rock-dominated cores, that are likely to be preferentially sampled as meteorites by disruption and transport processes. Our results suggest that multiple large main belt asteroids formed beyond the NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ snow lines (currently $>10$ au) and could be transported to their current locations. Earth's high hydrogen to carbon ratio may be explained by accretion of these water-rich progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rivers and streams act as globally significant sources of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) to the atmosphere, in part through denitrification reactions that will increase in response to ongoing anthropogenic nitrogen loading. While many factors that contribute to the release of N 2 O relative to inert dinitrogen (N 2 ) are well described, the ability to predict N 2 O yields from streams remains a fundamental challenge. Here, I revisit results from the second Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiments (LINX II) in the context of turbulent hyporheic exchange. Denitrification efficiency, or the fraction of nitrate delivered to the streambed by stream turbulence that is chemically reduced, emerges as the single best predictor of N 2 O yields and underpins the first statistically significant models of inter‐site N 2 O yields. This mechanistic connection is supported by reactive transport modeling of hyporheic zone denitrification representing advective flowpaths, flowpath mixing, and diffusion‐dominated anoxic microzones. Simulated N 2 O yields are inversely correlated with denitrification efficiency; however, advective models are unable to capture low LINX II N 2 O yields at low denitrification efficiencies. Hyporheic zone mixing exacerbates this inability to capture observed N 2 O yields via the promotion of N 2 O release from fast, oxic flowpaths. Instead, anoxic microzones are required to account for LINX II observations through consistently low N 2 O yields and the consumption of upstream‐produced N 2 O. Together, these results provide a framework for controls on stream N 2 O yields and suggest that stream corridor restoration designs aimed at increasing the capacity of hyporheic zones to remediate nitrate loading, as opposed to increasing hyporheic exchange, will also reduce proportional N 2 O emissions.",

Accompanying seismic low‐frequency earthquakes located precisely in time and space provide an opportunity to image slow slip dynamics at subdaily time scales. Here we show that a high‐resolution time history of low‐frequency earthquake fault slip alone can reproduce the geodetic record of slow slip that we observe to be dominated by subdaily fault slip dynamics. However, a simple linear model cannot accommodate the complex dynamics present throughout the slow slip cycle, and an analysis of different phases of the slow slip cycle shows that the ratio of geodetic to seismic fault slip varies as a function of time. This suggests that the low‐frequency earthquake source region saturates as slow slip grows in moment and area. We propose that rheological heterogeneities at the plate boundary associated with low‐frequency earthquakes do not play a significant role in the slow slip rupture process, thus implying that their activity is incidental to the driving aseismic slip.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tectonics exerts a strong control over the morphology of Earth's surface that is apparent in active mountain belts. In lowland areas, subtle processes like lithospheric flexure and isostatic rebound can impact Earth surface dynamics, hydrologic connectivity, and topography, suggesting that geomorphic and hydrologic analyses can shed light on underlying lithospheric properties. Here we examine the effect of lithospheric flexure on the geomorphology, hydrology, and river water chemistry of the Rio Bermejo fluvial system in the east Andean foreland basin of northern Argentina. Results show that proximal to the mountain front, foredeep basin subsidence causes sedimentation along a braided channel belt that is superelevated relative to the surrounding flood basin. During floods, water flows from the superelevated channel into the groundwater reservoir, causing a net loss of discharge with distance downstream. Further downstream, forebulge uplift forces channel narrowing, high lateral migration rates, and incision up to 13 m into older river deposits. This incision locally allows groundwater flow into the river, causing a ∼20% increase in river solute load. Groundwater emerges from the forebulge into the backbulge, predominantly as spring‐fed channels. Here, channel migration rates decrease, suggesting a switch from net uplift to subsidence that reduces the depth to the groundwater table. This analysis shows that subtle lithospheric flexure can have significant effects on river channel morphology that determine hydrologic flow paths, and ultimately influence geochemical and ecological patterns. We suggest that these effects may elucidate lithospheric properties that are otherwise inferred from bulk geophysical observations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Large uncertainties in North American terrestrial carbon fluxes hinder regional climate projections. Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), the essential tools for understanding continental‐scale carbon cycle, diverge on whether temperate forests or croplands dominate carbon uptake in North America. Evidence from novel photosynthetic proxies, such as those based on chlorophyll fluorescence, has cast doubt on the “weak cropland, strong forest” carbon uptake patterns simulated by most TBMs. However, no systematic evaluation of TBMs has yet been attempted to pin down space‐time patterns that are most consistent with regional CO 2 observational constraints. Here, we leverage atmospheric CO 2 observations and satellite‐observed photosynthetic proxies to understand emergent space‐time patterns in North American carbon fluxes from a large suite of TBMs and data‐driven models. To do so, we evaluate how well the atmospheric signals resulting from carbon flux estimates reproduce the space‐time variability in atmospheric CO 2 , as is observed by a network of continuous‐monitoring towers over North America. Models with gross or net carbon fluxes that are consistent with the observed CO 2 variability share a salient feature of growing‐season carbon uptake in Midwest US croplands. Conversely, the remaining models place most growing‐season uptake in boreal or temperate forests. Differences in model explanatory power depend mainly on the simulated annual cycles of cropland uptake—especially, the timing of peak uptake—rather than the distribution of annual mean fluxes across biomes. Our results suggest that improved model representation of cropland phenology is crucial to robust, policy‐relevant estimation of North American carbon exchange.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The most common explanation for the depletion of high frequency waves that defines low‐frequency earthquakes (LFEs) and very low‐frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) is that fault rupture and slip are slower than typical earthquakes. However, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that the high frequency waves are produced during slip, but attenuated near the LFE source. One reason this hypothesis has been poorly tested is that there are no measurements of attenuation on the relevant rocks. We present the results of forced oscillation experiments that measure the frequency‐dependent attenuation of a chlorite‐rich metapelitic schist, a lithology found along the subduction plate boundary where LFEs and VLFEs have been documented. Experiments were run on dry and water‐saturated schist at effective pressures of 2–10 MPa and at frequencies of 2 × 10 −5 –30 Hz. We find that pore fluids and low effective pressure result in the attenuation of high frequencies. The frequency‐dependent attenuation is consistent with the concomitant operation of two wave‐induced fluid flow mechanisms, squirt flow, and patchy saturation. When the effects of these mechanisms are extrapolated to geologic conditions using rock physics models, our results predict that attenuation is capable of completely diminishing the frequencies depleted in LFEs and VLFEs. Therefore, LFEs and VLFEs may not necessarily record slow fault slip, but possibly the presence of high fluid pressure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Radiative cooling of the lowest atmospheric levels is of strong importance for modulating atmospheric circulations and organizing convection, but detailed observations and a robust theoretical understanding are lacking. Here we use unprecedented observational constraints from subsidence regimes in the tropical Atlantic to develop a theory for the shape and magnitude of low‐level longwave radiative cooling in clear‐sky, showing peaks larger than 5–10 K/day at the top of the boundary layer. A suite of novel scaling approximations is first developed from simplified spectral theory, in close agreement with the measurements. The radiative cooling peak height is set by the maximum lapse rate in water vapor path, and its magnitude is mainly controlled by the ratio of column relative humidity above and below the peak. We emphasize how elevated intrusions of moist air can reduce low‐level cooling, by sporadically shading the spectral range which effectively cools to space. The efficiency of this spectral shading depends both on water content and altitude of moist intrusions; its height dependence cannot be explained by the temperature difference between the emitting and absorbing layers, but by the decrease of water vapor extinction with altitude. This analytical work can help to narrow the search for low‐level cloud patterns sensitive to radiative‐convective feedbacks: the most organized patterns with largest cloud fractions occur in atmospheres below 10% relative humidity and feel the strongest low‐level cooling. This motivates further assessment of favorable conditions for radiative‐convective feedbacks and a robust quantification of corresponding shallow cloud dynamics in current and warmer climates.",

We compared landscape integrity (degree of modification by humans), habitat for three keystone species, forest carbon density, accumulation, and total biomass carbon stocks across 154 NFs in the United States. Southern Alaska's Tongass and Chugach NFs hold disproportionally large amounts of high landscape integrity area among all NFs with 25.3% and 5.6% (total 30.9%) of all high (≥9.6) landscape integrity found on NF lands. The Tongass and Chugach store approximately 33% and 3% of all biomass carbon stocks that occur in NFs with high landscape integrity. These two NFs together account for about 49%, 37%, and 18% of all bald eagle, brown bear, and gray wolf habitat found on NF lands. Gray wolf habitat extent was 4% of the total or less on remaining NFs. The Tongass and Chugach were historically wetter and cooler among NFs, and are projected to experience much larger increases in precipitation and much lower increases in maximum temperatures over the coming century. Combined with relatively low recent occurrence of wildfire, this makes permanence more likely. The Tongass and Chugach forests, along with the Pacific Northwest's high carbon density forests should be a high priority for protection and conservation to meet climate and biodiversity goals given their landscape‐scale scarcity and high value.",

Here, we combine new laboratory constraints on S[IV] disproportionation kinetics with a novel aqueous photochemistry model to estimate the concentrations of S[IV] in natural waters on prebiotic Earth. We show that S[IV] disproportionation is slow in pH ≥ 7 waters, with timescale T ≥ 1 year at room temperature, meaning that S[IV] was present in prebiotic natural waters. However, we also show that photolysis of S[IV] by UV light on prebiotic Earth limited [S[IV]] &lt; 100 µM in global‐mean steady‐state. Because of photolysis, [S[IV]] was much lower in natural waters compared to the concentrations generally invoked in laboratory simulations of origins‐of‐life chemistry (≥10 mM), meaning further work is needed to confirm whether laboratory S[IV]‐dependent prebiotic chemistries could have functioned in nature. [S[IV]] ≥ 1 µM in terrestrial waters for: (a) SO 2 outgassing ≥20× modern, (b) pond depths &lt;10 cm, or (c) UV‐attenuating agents present in early waters or the prebiotic atmosphere. Marine S[IV] was sub‐saturated with respect to atmospheric SO 2 , meaning that atmospheric SO 2 deposition was efficient and that, within the constraints of present knowledge, UV‐attenuating sulfur hazes could only have persisted on prebiotic Earth if sulfur emission rates were very high (≳100× modern). Our work illustrates the synergy between planetary science, geochemistry and synthetic organic chemistry toward understanding the emergence and maintenance of life on early Earth.",

    "abstract": "The effect of late-Cenozoic climate cooling on global erosion rates is intensely debated (e.g., Willenbring & Jerolmack, 2016). First, there is a lack of consensus on the use of the sedimentary record as a proxy for erosion (Straub et al., 2020; Willenbring & von Blanckenburg, 2010) and second, the paucity of data in available paleo-erosion rate records makes differentiation between tectonic and climatic forcings difficult (Schildgen et al., 2018; Whipple, 2009). More recently, Mandal et al. (2021) analyzed cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in foreland sediments from the north-western Indian Himalaya dating back 6 Ma. Their detailed erosion record suggests an approximately one-million-year periodicity in erosion rates with a gradual increase towards the present. The authors relate the inferred quasi-cyclic pattern in erosion rates to the tectonic growth of the Himalaya, rather than to changes in climate. Their findings suggest that tectonic accretion processes dominate erosion rate changes over the late-Cenozoic, and may thus confound climatic interpretations of erosion rate histories in collisional orogenic settings globally. Cosmogenic nuclides (especially 10Be) have been shown to be a robust metric of erosion rates (Granger & Schaller, 2014). However, applying the technique to ancient sediment is not trivial. The cosmogenic nuclide inventory in an ancient sediment parcel will be a function of the mean erosion rate, altitude, and latitude of the sediment's source area, and of its pathway through the sediment routing system into the depositional sink. At the source, changes in erosion rate will manifest in changes in nuclide concentration, moderated by the response time of the cosmogenic nuclide \"clock.\" The latter, in turn, depends on the nuclide's half-life, the amplitude and duration of forcing, and the amount of buffering occurring within the landscape (Granger & Schaller, 2014) (Figure 1a). As the sediment parcel moves through the colluvial and fluvial systems, its cosmogenic nuclide inventory may increase, decrease, or stay constant. Further, the degree of change in nuclide concentration will also depend on the production rate and half-life of each cosmogenic nuclide (Figure 1a). Protracted sediment transport may result in an increase in nuclide concentrations, whereas reworking of deeply buried and old sediment will incorporate material with depleted inventories of shorter-lived nuclides such as 26Al, 36Cl, and 14C, but with unchanged inventories of longer-lived or stable nuclides, such as 10Be and 21Ne (Fülöp et al., 2020; Vermeesch et al., 2010). Changes to nuclide inventories may also occur in the depositional sink. Following abandonment, cosmogenic nuclide accumulation will continue until the overburden becomes thick enough to completely shield cosmic rays and may also occur as the stratigraphic section is reworked and exposed at the surface by subsequent geological processes (Straub et al., 2020). Lastly, substantial loss of nuclides via radioactive decay will occur in the sink, and, depending on the deposition age, may result in the complete depletion of shorter-lived radionuclides (Figure 1a). Changes in cosmogenic nuclide inventories during source-to-sink sediment transfer. (a) Cosmogenic nuclides accumulate in surficial rocks in proportion to the rate of erosion. Following detachment from bedrock, the cosmogenic nuclide inventory in a parcel of sediment moving from the source region undergoing erosion to the depositional sink may increase, decrease, or stay constant, depending on the characteristics of the sediment routing system, the rate of deposition in the sink, and the nuclide's half-life. (b) Multiple cosmogenic nuclide pairs measured in ancient fluvial sediment from a sedimentary section may provide independent constraints on the alteration of the cosmogenic nuclide signal during sediment transport and deposition in addition to providing controls on deposition age. It is impossible to unravel the complex histories of sediment grains as they travel from the erosional source areas to the depositional sinks from the abundance of a single cosmogenic nuclide (e.g., 10Be). To minimize environmental signal buffering associated with complex sediment routing systems, Mandal et al. (2021) target a proximal foreland basin that is, intimately linked to the eroding hinterland. The high erosion rates characterizing tectonically active mountain ranges (Codilean et al., 2018) mean that cosmogenic 10Be response times to changes in erosion rates are short in these settings. Further, despite prolific sediment buffering occurring in the source regions of Himalayan rivers (Blöthe & Korup, 2013), there is evidence that the 10Be record of mountain erosion may be effectively transmitted with minimal alteration (Wittmann & von Blanckenburg, 2016). Nevertheless, important limitations remain. First, there is no independent control on paleo-source-area characteristics or lag times (Figure 1b). Second, how the 10Be signal might be altered once sediment is deposited in the sink is also largely unconstrained, as a proximal foreland basin may include hiatuses or unsteady accumulation rates that directly reflect the hinterland tectonics and climate (Straub et al., 2020). The envelope of accumulation rates that are determinable from Mandal et al.'s magnetostratigraphic record does expand at time scales less than 1.3 million years, as would be expected for a strong periodicity among hiatuses in the stratigraphic section itself (Sadler & Strauss, 1990). Mandal et al. (2021) identify fluctuations in erosion rate that approach long timescales at which several interrelated environmental forcings might be dominant: Milankovitch grand cycles of climate change, source area uplift, and the tectonic accommodation of resulting sediments in a non-marine setting. In the proximal Himalayan foreland, the authors apply cosmogenic 10Be analysis and magnetostratigraphy for independent dating of locally unsteady, upstream erosion and downstream accommodation rate, respectively. They point to the imbricate thrust faults of the upstream duplex structures as plausible drivers of correspondingly pulsed uplift. The challenges, going forward, are to find an independent means to date individual fault histories and to better resolve the potentially complex sediment pathways. Numerical experiments have suggested that climate-driven increases in erosion rate would be out of phase with accommodation rate in the adjacent basins (Whipple, 2009), leading to two questions pertinent for this study: do empirical erosion rates, tectonic pulses and sediment accumulation rates share the same periodicity? Are they in-phase or out-of-phase? The ways landscapes respond to tectonic or climatic perturbations will depend on the perturbation itself and on how the erosional and depositional parts of the landscape are linked by the sediment-routing system (Allen, 2008). The ability to identify changes in erosion rates through time will depend on the temporal resolution of the erosion rate record and on the capacity of the sediment-routing system to buffer environmental signals (e.g., Lenard et al., 2020). Settling the debate on the links between late-Cenozoic cooling, tectonics, and global erosion rates will require paleo-erosion-rate records with a high temporal resolution (e.g., Mariotti et al., 2021) and approaches that leverage the power of multiple cosmogenic nuclide pairs to decipher the complex histories of sediment as they travel from the erosional source to the depositional sink.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plants track changing climate partly by shifting their phenology, the timing of recurring biological events. It is unknown whether these observed phenological shifts are sufficient to keep pace with rapid climate changes. Phenological mismatch, or the desynchronization between the timing of critical phenological events, has long been hypothesized but rarely quantified on a large scale. It is even less clear how human activities have contributed to this emergent phenological mismatch. In this study, we used remote sensing observations to systematically evaluate how plant phenological shifts have kept pace with warming trends at the continental scale. In particular, we developed a metric of spatial mismatch that connects empirical spatiotemporal data to ecological theory using the “velocity of change” approach. In northern mid‐to high‐latitude regions (between 30–70°N) over the last three decades (1981–2014), we found evidence of a widespread mismatch between land surface phenology and climate where isolines of phenology lag behind or move in the opposite direction to the isolines of climate. These mismatches were more pronounced in human‐dominated landscapes, suggesting a relationship between human activities and the desynchronization of phenology dynamics with climate variations. Results were corroborated with independent ground observations that indicate the mismatch of spring phenology increases with human population density for several plant species. This study reveals the possibility that not even some of the foremost responses in vegetation activity match the pace of recent warming. This systematic analysis of climate‐phenology mismatch has important implications for the sustainable management of vegetation in human‐dominated landscapes under climate change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Floodplains of large alluvial rivers modulate the composition of riverine organic carbon (OC) and control OC oxidative loss, constituting a critical component in the global river‐atmosphere‐ocean carbon cycle. Therefore, anthropogenic management disconnecting rivers from their floodplains is expected to reduce the oxidative loss and to change the quality and quantity of riverine OC exported to the ocean. Here, we test this idea by combining two chronometers— 14 C age spectra of OC and optically stimulated luminescence ages of quartz—to interrogate sediments of the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) system to constrain the anthropogenic effects on carbon cycling in a continental‐scale sediment routing system. The 14 C age of the LMR OC has been reduced from &gt;5,000 yr in prehistoric sediments to &lt;3,000 yr in historic and modern sediments with significantly narrowed age spectrum width, following centuries of embanking the LMR. Bank stabilization reduced the river‐floodplain sediment exchange by ∼90%, effectively cutting off older floodplain OC from the river and reducing OC residence time in the severely truncated floodplain system, and expedited the downstream transmission of OC. The reduced residence time will have decreased riverine OC loss and enhanced younger OC delivery to marine sediments. We estimate that the oxidative loss of the LMR OC has been reduced by ≥ 1.1 Tg C/yr or 40%. Extrapolation to other large rivers that have undergone anthropogenic changes similar to the LMR illustrates that this process likely represents a carbon sink that can significantly increase if currently free‐flowing large tropical rivers are embanked in the future.",

Our analysis demonstrates that it is not possible to explain the tropics‐wide partitioning of precipitation unless one assumes that rain is favored over land. Land receives more than its fair share of precipitation by broadening and letting the tropical rainbelts move more, effectively underpinning a negative feedback between surface water storage and precipitation. In contrast, rain is disfavored over land in climate models. Our findings suggest that the abundance of rainfall that shapes the terrestrial tropical biosphere is more robust to perturbations than models have suggested.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ice cores and other paleotemperature proxies, together with general circulation models, have provided information on past surface temperatures and the atmosphere's composition in different climates. Little is known, however, about past temperatures at high altitudes, which play a crucial role in Earth's radiative energy budget. Paleoclimate records at high‐altitude sites are sparse, and the few that are available show poor agreement with climate model predictions. These disagreements could be due to insufficient spatial coverage, spatiotemporal biases, or model physics; new records that can mitigate or avoid these uncertainties are needed. Here, we constrain the change in upper‐tropospheric temperature at the global scale during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using the clumped‐isotope composition of molecular oxygen trapped in polar ice cores. Aided by global three‐dimensional chemical transport modeling, we exploit the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of the clumped‐isotope composition of atmospheric oxygen to infer that the upper troposphere (effective mean altitude 10–11 km) was 6–9°C cooler during the LGM than during the late preindustrial Holocene. A complementary energy balance approach supports a minor or negligible steepening of atmospheric lapse rates during the LGM, which is consistent with a range of climate model simulations. Proxy‐model disagreements with other high‐altitude records may stem from inaccuracies in regional hydroclimate simulation, possibly related to land‐atmosphere feedbacks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract On 8 July 2021 a M6.0 normal faulting earthquake rocked the community of Walker and the surrounding region near the California‐Nevada border. In the 1990s, field surveys of nearby Meadowcliff Canyon identified numerous precarious rocks deemed likely to topple in the event of strong shaking. Despite their proximity (∼6 km) to the 2021 earthquake, the precarious rocks still remain standing. In this work, we combine advanced source and ground motion characterization techniques to help unravel this mystery. High‐precision hypocentral locations reveal a clear north/south‐striking, east‐dipping rupture plane along the southern extension of the Slinkard Valley fault. The mainshock nucleated near the base of the fault, triggering thousands of aftershocks. Bayesian source spectral analyses indicate that the mainshock had a moderately‐high stress drop (∼17 MPa), and that aftershocks with deeper hypocenters have higher stress drops. Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) recordings at regional stations agree well with existing ground motion models, predicting PGA of ∼0.3 g in Meadowcliff Canyon, a level sufficient to topple precarious rocks based on PGA‐derived stability criteria. We demonstrate that despite these large ground accelerations, the pulse duration in Meadowcliff Canyon is too short to supply the impulse necessary to damage these features, observations which support the application of dynamic toppling models that account for the joint effects of pulse amplitude and duration when assessing rock fragility. This study provides a unique vantage point from which to interpret rarely‐observed strong‐motion recordings from close to an active normal fault, one of many that dominate hazard along the eastern Sierra.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies of the impacts of solar geoengineering have mostly ignored tropospheric chemistry. By decreasing the sunlight reaching Earth's surface, geoengineering may help mitigate anthropogenic climate change, but changing sunlight also alters the rates of chemical reactions throughout the troposphere. Using the GEOS‐Chem atmospheric chemistry model, we show that stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) with sulfate, a frequently studied solar geoengineering method, can perturb tropospheric composition over a span of 10 years, increasing tropospheric oxidative capacity by 9% and reducing methane lifetime. SAI decreases the overall flux of shortwave radiation into the troposphere, but increases flux at certain UV wavelengths due to stratospheric ozone depletion. These radiative changes, in turn, perturb tropospheric photochemistry, driving chemical feedbacks that can substantially influence the seasonal and spatial patterns of radiative forcing beyond what is caused by enhanced stratospheric aerosol concentrations alone. For example, chemical feedbacks decrease the radiative effectiveness of geoengineering in northern high latitude summer by 20%. Atmospheric chemical feedbacks also imply the potential for net global public health benefits associated with stratospheric ozone depletion, as the decreases in mortality resulting from SAI‐induced improvements in air quality outweigh the increases in mortality due to increased UV radiation exposure. Such chemical feedbacks also lead to improved plant growth. Our results show the importance of including fuller representations of atmospheric chemistry in studies of solar geoengineering and underscore the risk of surprises from this technology that could carry unexpected consequences for Earth's climate, the biosphere, and human health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The fracture of Earth materials occurs over a wide range of time and length scales. Physical conditions, particularly the stress field and Earth material properties, may condition rupture in a specific fracture regime. In nature, fast and slow fractures occur concurrently: tectonic tremor events are fast enough to emit seismic waves and frequently accompany slow earthquakes, which are too slow to emit seismic waves and are referred to as aseismic slip events. In this study, we generate simultaneous seismic and aseismic processes in a laboratory setting by driving a penny‐shaped crack in a transparent sample with pressurized fluid. We leverage synchronized high‐speed imaging and high‐frequency acoustic emission (AE) sensing to visualize and listen to the various sequences of propagation (breaks) and arrest (sticks) of a fracture undergoing stick‐break instabilities. Slow radial crack propagation is facilitated by fast tangential fractures. Fluid viscosity and pressure regulate the fracture dynamics of slow and fast events, and control the inter‐event time and the energy released during individual fast events. These AE signals share behaviors with observations of episodic tremors in Cascadia, United States; these include: (a) bursty or intermittent slow propagation, and (b) nearly linear scaling of radiated energy with area. Our laboratory experiments provide a plausible model of tectonic tremor as an indicative of hydraulic fracturing facilitating shear slip during slow earthquakes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Samoan hotspot generated an age‐progressive volcanic track that can be traced back to 24 Ma at Alexa Bank, but the trace of the older portion (&gt;24 Ma) of the hotspot track is unclear. We show that six seamounts located in and around the Magellan Seamount chain—north of the Ontong‐Java Plateau (OJP)—have ages (87–106 Ma), geochemistry, and locations consistent with absolute plate motion model reconstructions of the Samoan hotspot track in the late Cretaceous, and three additional seamounts have geochemistry and locations consistent with a Samoan origin. However, a large segment of the Samoan hotspot (24–87 Ma) remains unidentified. Absolute plate motion models show that, from ∼60 to 30 Ma, the OJP passed over the Samoan plume. The exceptional thickness of the OJP lithosphere may have largely suppressed Samoan plume melting because the inferred volcanic trace of the Samoan hotspot wanes, and then disappears, on the OJP. Fortunately, 44 Ma volcanism at Malaita Island, located on the southern margin of the OJP, has a location, age, and geochemistry consistent with a Samoan plume origin, and provides a “missing link” bridging the younger and older segments of the Samoan hotspot. Our synthesis of geochemical, geochronological, and plate motion model evidence reveals that Samoa exhibits a clear hotspot age progression for over 100 Myr. Passage of ancient plateaus over young plumes—here called “plume‐plateau” interaction—may be relatively common: the OJP also passed over the putative Rarotonga hotspot, and the Society and Pitcairn hotspots were overtopped by the Manihiki Plateau.",

This evolution is driven by a confluence of internal and external forces, including the growth of metrics‐based evaluation of scientists; an increasing volume of manuscripts combined with expectations for rapid review and publication; an increasing number of journals, including for‐profit Open Access publications; and the adoption of preprint servers across a growing range of disciplines. Many of these forces are contributing to personal anxiety and fatigue for authors, reviewers, and editors. Collectively, they are placing substantial stress on scientific publishing, which is a foundational pillar of the scientific enterprise. As editors of American Geophysical Union journals and books, we remain confident in the fundamental foundations of scientific publishing, but we are concerned about the impact of these increasing stressors. By affirming and investing in editorial values, respecting scientific integrity and credibility, and committing to accessibility, transparency, and accountability, we can fortify the foundations of the scientific enterprise during a time of rapid change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Boreal wildfires modify surface climates affecting plant physiology, permafrost thaw, and carbon fluxes. Post‐fire temperatures vary over decades because of successional vegetation changes. Yet, the underlying biophysical drivers remain uncertain. Here, we quantify surface climate changes following fire disturbances in the North American boreal forest and identify its dominant biophysical drivers. We analyze multi‐year land‐atmosphere energy exchange and satellite observations from across North America and find post‐fire daytime surface temperatures to be substantially warmer for about five decades while winter temperatures are slightly cooler. Post‐fire decadal changes are characterized by decreasing leaf area index during the first decade, by sharply increasing surface albedo during the snow cover period, and by a less efficient heat exchange between the forest and the atmosphere caused by decreasing surface roughness for about 2–3 decades. Over the first three decades, the amount of energy used for evapotranspiration increases before returning to lower values. We find that surface warming is mainly explained by less efficient forest‐atmosphere heat exchange while cooling is additionally explained by increasing surface albedo. We estimate that biome‐wide daytime surface temperatures of the Canadian boreal forest in 2024 are 0.27°C warmer in the summer and 0.02°C cooler during the winter because of fire. For a scenario with a strong increase in burned area, we estimate annual warming from fire to increase by a third until 2050. Our study highlights the potential for accelerated surface warming in the boreal biome with increasing wildfire activity and disentangles the biophysical drivers of fire‐related surface climate impacts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Magnetosheath High‐Speed Jets (HSJs) are transient disturbances characterized by increased dynamic pressure. They can cause various geoeffects, including ultra‐low‐frequency (ULF) waves and auroras. Theoretically, when ULF waves propagate into the ionosphere as Alfvén waves, they can accelerate electrons and generate discrete auroras. However, what types of aurora can be driven by HSJs and what are the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using coordinated magnetosheath in situ and ground observations, here, we showed that when a HSJ was identified in the magnetosheath, multiple auroral arcs parallel to the auroral oval were observed near local noon. The electron energy spectrogram of these arcs exhibited “inverted‐V” structures, indicating the existence of quasi‐static parallel electric fields. Concurrently, long‐period ULF signals were detected on the ground, suggesting the arrival of Alfvén waves. These observations are represented by a kinetic simulation using realistic observational inputs, showing consistency with the theory regarding the generation of the “inverted‐V” structure by long‐period Alfvén waves. This study builds a previously unestablished connection among HSJ, ULF wave, and aurora, and provides a mechanism for generation of discrete auroral arcs near local noon, which may reveal the underlying mechanism behind a specific auroral activity commonly observed near local noon as shown in the paper.",

These purposes cover a broad spectrum of applications, from larger vehicles designed for passenger transport, to package delivery and inspection/surveillance missions performed by small unmanned drones. While these Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations have the potential to alleviate bottlenecks arising from saturated surface transportation networks, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed to make these operations safe and viable. One challenge is predicting weather effects within the urban environment with the required level of spatiotemporal fidelity, which current operational weather models fail to provide due to the use of coarse grid spacings (a few kilometers) constrained by the predictive performance limitations of traditional computer architectures. Herein, we demonstrate how FastEddy®, a microscale model that exploits the accelerated nature of graphics processing units for high‐performance computing, can be used to understand and predict urban weather impacts from seasonal, day‐to‐day, diurnal, and sub‐hourly scales. To that end, we efficiently perform more than 50 telescoped simulations of microscale urban effects at street‐scale (5 m grid spacing) driven by realistic weather over a 20 km 2 region centered at the downtown area of Dallas, Texas. Our analyses demonstrate that urban‐weather interactions at the street‐scale are complex and tightly connected, which is of utmost relevance to AAM operations. These demonstrations reveal the capability of such models to provide real‐time weather hazard avoidance products tailored to capture microscale urban effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions (ffCO 2 ) constitute the majority of greenhouse gas emissions and are the main determinant of global climate change. The COVID‐19 pandemic caused wide‐scale disruption to human activity and provided an opportunity to evaluate our capability to detect ffCO 2 emission reductions. Quantifying changes in ffCO 2 levels is especially challenging in cities, where climate mitigation policies are being implemented but local emissions lead to spatially and temporally complex atmospheric mixing ratios. Here, we assess ffCO 2 emission patterns associated with pandemic‐induced changes to human activity using direct observations of on‐road CO 2 mole fractions in the Los Angeles (LA) urban area and analyses of the radiocarbon ( 14 C) content of annual grasses collected by community scientists throughout California, USA. With COVID‐19 mobility restrictions in place in 2020, we observed a significant reduction in ffCO 2 levels across California, especially in urban centers. In LA, on‐road CO 2 enhancements were 60 ± 16% lower than the corresponding period of 2019 and rebounded to pre‐pandemic levels by 2021. Plant 14 C analysis indicated ffCO 2 reductions of 5 ± 10 ppm in 2020 relative to pre‐pandemic observations in LA. However, ffCO 2 emission trajectories varied substantially by region and sector as COVID‐related restrictions were relaxed. Further development of these techniques could aid efforts to monitor decarbonization in cities, especially in developing countries without established CO 2 monitoring infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, is the only potential ocean world in the inner Solar System. Previous studies identified deposits of aliphatic organics in and around the Ernutet crater, and at small locations at Inamahari and Urvara craters. The origin of organics, either endogenic or exogenic, in these fresh exposures is still under debate. This study addresses the origin of the organics by analyzing their global distribution and geologic context. Our first step involved a global search for organic‐rich sites that might have escaped previous detections. We achieved this by using a deep neural network, utilizing spectral redness in the Dawn's Framing Camera multispectral data to identify potential organic‐rich sites. The identified sites were further studied by using IR spectrometer data to infer the compositions of materials showing spectral redness. Of the newly identified red‐sloped sites, only two can be considered certain to be organic‐rich. We also identified sites with spectral redness, but without any signature of organics in their infrared spectra. These sites could be attributed to the aqueous alteration of magnetite into ferric‐iron bearing phases. At Ernutet, Inamahari, and Urvara, the organic‐rich material is confined to the near surface only. Additionally, the absence of tectonic/volcanic features at these sites makes an endogenic origin questionable. The global rarity of detectable organics also supports this assessment. Consequently, we suggest that organics at these sites were originally delivered by low‐velocity, organic‐rich impactor(s) from the main belt and subsequently excavated, rather than originating from endogenous processes.",

We develop a new index that incorporates information on urban trees' health and function, in addition to their presence. This index, when applied across MSP, suggests that canopy benefits may not be distributed equally even in neighborhoods with similar canopy cover. Furthermore, accounting for tree health and function can yield more effective and equitable benefits by guiding the location and magnitude of intervention for urban tree management.",

Reasons for differences in fire patterns can be difficult to determine due to variable vegetation types, land use patterns, fuel conditions, and human influences on fire ignition and suppression. This study compares burned areas to climate and fuel conditions in three temperate regions: the desert, shrub, and forest ecoregions of western North America, west‐central Europe, and southwestern South America. In each region the mean annual aridity index (AI, precipitation over potential evapotranspiration) spans arid to humid climates. We examined how the fraction of area burned from 2001 to 2021 varied with mean annual AI, mean aboveground biomass, and land cover type distributions. All three regions had low fractions of area burned for the driest climate zones (AI &lt; 0.5), a sign of fuel limitation to burned area. Fraction of area burned increased with mean aboveground biomass for these dry zones. Fraction of area burned peaked at intermediate AI (0.7–1.5) for all regions and declined again in the wettest climate zones (AI &gt; 1.5), a sign of climate limitation to burned area. Of the three regions, western North America had the highest burned area, fraction of area burned, and fire sizes. Fragmentation of vegetation patches by the high Andes Mountains in southwestern South America and by intensive land use changes in west‐central Europe likely limited fire sizes. All three regions are at risk for future wildfires, particularly in areas where fire is currently climate limited.",

Despite this potential, few field trials have been published that verify the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential of enhanced weathering in croplands and, until now, none had been published in grazing lands. Anthony et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024AV001480 ) conducted the first trial of enhanced weathering in a California rangeland and showed weathering of ground silicate rocks despite drought conditions in an already dry climate. Co‐application of inorganic (silicate rocks) with organic (biochar and compost) amendments revealed not just additive, but synergistic effects whereby organic amendments increased rates of weathering. This is important because field CDR rates were &lt;10% of the theoretical maximum (i.e., the rate if basalt was completely weathered); thus, methods to improve weathering rates will be necessary for this practice to scale in a meaningful way. Multi‐carbon pool measurements revealed not only how co‐application of soil amendments heightened net carbon benefits, but also how soil amendments complemented each other to produce net benefits for soil carbon, biomass growth, and greenhouse gas emission reductions.

Such diversity of climate information, that is bridged in a flexible approach, allows evaluating the hazard of hydrological droughts for any large catchment globally. By focusing on the specific case of Alpine regions and analyzing the information contained in an ensemble for the period 1100–2100, we show that, compared to the past nine centuries, the mean annual flow in the Po River (Italy's main water course) may decrease by about 10% during the 21st century, while the mean drought duration and severity are likely to increase by approximately 11% and 12%, respectively. Future drought conditions are likely to match, or even exceed, the driest period of the Medieval Climate Anomaly under different emissions scenarios. This indicates unprecedented drought conditions in Alpine regions in the coming decades, thus calling for an increased preparedness in managing water resources under climate change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract True polar wander (TPW), the rotation of the solid Earth relative to the spin axis, is driven by changes in the Earth's moment of inertia induced by mantle convection and may have influenced past climate and life. Long‐term TPW is typically inferred from large polar shifts in paleomagnetic apparent polar wander paths or computed directly by rotating them in a mantle reference frame. However, most apparent polar wander paths do not incorporate uncertainties in paleomagnetic data, which may bias estimates of TPW. Here, we provide new quantitative estimates of TPW since 320 Ma by placing a recent global apparent polar wander path corrected for age bias and with improved uncertainty quantification in existing mantle reference frames. We find large amplitude (&gt;10°) but slow TPW rotations that predominantly occurred about two equatorial axes that are approximately orthogonal. During the Triassic and Jurassic, a ∼24° TPW oscillation occurred about an axis at ∼15°W, close to the present‐day TPW axis at ∼10°E. In contrast, the TPW axis was located at ∼85°E during a smaller oscillation (∼6–10°) over the past ∼80 Ma, as well as between 260 and 320 Ma. We propose that these varying TPW axes reflect changes in the distribution and flux of subduction in the Tethyan and Pacific realms. We find no evidence for previously postulated fast (&gt;1°/Ma) TPW oscillations in the Cretaceous and Late Jurassic. Finally, we propose that calibrating mantle convection models against reconstructed TPW will improve our understanding of mantle dynamics and the drivers of TPW itself.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The viscosity of magma has a first‐order control on the explosivity and hazards of a volcanic eruption, and the detection of diking within the subsurface may indicate an eruption is imminent. As magma approaches the surface it is highly likely it will have a non‐Newtonian shear‐thinning rheology (apparent viscosity decreases as shear rate increases), yet most dike models assume magma is a simple Newtonian fluid. Here we use laser light and particle image velocimetry to image flow within a scaled experimental dike hosting a shear‐thinning fluid. The results show that the internal flow dynamics of shear‐thinning magma in dikes are very different to Newtonian dikes. The velocity of shear‐thinning flow radiates out toward the dike margin at similar magnitude across the dike plane; this is very different to the jet flow and recirculation characteristic of the Newtonian dike model at the same conditions. A linear relationship between tip velocity and inlet Reynolds number in the viscous regime () is confirmed to also apply to shear‐thinning fluids, and transitional flow () is generated experimentally for the first time. These findings suggest that magma rheology (Newtonian or shear‐thinning) cannot be recognized from external factors, such as the dike tip velocity. These results mark a step‐change in dike modeling, introducing a new physical framework to test the petrological and geochemical evidence of magma ascent dynamics in dikes leading to volcanic eruptions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sub‐Antarctic Mode Waters (SAMWs) form to the north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Indo‐Pacific Ocean, whence they ventilate the ocean's lower pycnocline and play an important role in the climate system. With a backward Lagrangian particle‐tracking experiment in a data‐assimilative model of the Southern Ocean (B‐SOSE), we address the long‐standing question of the extent to which SAMWs originate from densification of southward‐flowing subtropical waters versus lightening of northward‐flowing Antarctic waters sourced by Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) upwelling. Our analysis evidences the co‐occurrence of both sources in all SAMW formation areas, and strong inter‐basin contrasts in their relative contributions. Subtropical waters are the main precursor of Indian Ocean SAMWs (70%–75% of particles) but contribute a smaller amount (40% of particles) to Pacific SAMWs, which are mainly sourced from the upwelled CDW. By tracking property changes along particle trajectories, we show that SAMW formation from northern and southern sources involves contrasting drivers: subtropical source waters are cooled and densified by surface heat fluxes, and freshened by ocean mixing. Southern source waters are warmed and lightened by surface heat and freshwater fluxes, and they are made either saltier by mixing in the case of Indian SAMWs, or fresher by surface fluxes in the case of Pacific SAMWs. Our results underscore the distinct climatic impact of Indian and Pacific SAMWs formation, involving net release of atmospheric heat and uptake of atmospheric freshwater, respectively; a role that is conferred by the relative contributions of subtropical and Antarctic sources to their formation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Extratropical storms dominate midlatitude climate and weather and are known to grow baroclinically and decay barotropically. Traditionally, quantitative climatic measures of storm activity have been mostly based on Eulerian measures, taking into account the mean state of the atmosphere and how those affect Eulerian eddy activity, but they do not consider the Lagrangian growth of the storms themselves. Here, using ERA‐5 reanalysis data and tracking all extratropical storms (cyclones and anticyclones) from 83 years of data, we examine the actual growth of the storms and compare it to the Eulerian characteristics of the background state as the storms develop. In the limit of weak baroclinicity, we find that baroclinicity provides a good measure for storm maximum intensity. However, this monotonic relationship breaks for high baroclinicity levels. We show that although the actual growth rate of individual storms monotonically increases with baroclinicity, the reduction in maximum intensity at high baroclinicity is caused by a decrease in storm growth time. Based on the Lagrangian analysis, we suggest a nonlinear correction to the traditional linear connection between baroclinicity and storms' activity. Then, we show that a simplified model of storm growth, incorporating the baroclinicity effect on the vertical tilt of anomalies, reproduces the observed nonlinear relationship. Expanding the analysis to include the mean flow's barotropic properties highlights their marginal effect on storm growth rate, but the crucial impact on growth time. Our results emphasize the potential of Lagrangianly studying storm dynamics to advance understanding of the midlatitude climate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Global cooling during the Late Cenozoic led to periodic glaciations in many mountain regions. The repeated waxing and waning of glaciers and ice sheets resulted in continuously changing erosion regimes that modified the underlying topography. While some studies have argued that relief increased due to glaciation, others have argued that glaciations limit relief. The (pre‐glacial or glacial?) origin of elevated low‐relief surfaces (ELRS) in mountain belts is similarly controversial. ELRS have been used to reconstruct pre‐glacial landscapes, trace patterns of glacial incision, and infer tectonic uplift; it is thus important to test to what extent, and under which circumstances, glaciations may produce ELRS. We use a glacial landscape‐evolution model to quantify the integrated effect of Pliocene‐Quaternary glaciations on the topography of a mountain range. Our simulations show that glaciations can produce ELRS by shielding bedrock under slow‐moving, non‐erosive ice at intermediate elevations, with erosion focused on ice‐free summits and at lower elevations. We term this mechanism for ELRS formation the glacial shelter effect. The final extent of ELRS strongly depends on the climatic history and the efficacy of local erosion, which affect both ELRS formation and preservation. Specifically, efficient fluvial erosion during warm interglacials may dissect previously formed ELRS. Modeled ELRS are distributed across elevations because their formation and preservation depend on ice extent rather than on the average equilibrium‐line altitude. Our model results provide a comprehensive framework for the impact of glaciations on topography that explains both the presence and absence of ELRS in glaciated areas.",

In this study we investigated when and where abrupt shifts occur in the latest generation of earth system models (CMIP6) under a scenario of 1% annual increase in CO 2 . We considered 82 ocean, atmosphere, and land variables across 57 models. We used a Canny edge detection method to identify abrupt shifts occurring on yearly to decadal timescales, and performed a connected component analysis to quantify the spatial extent of these shifts. The systems analyzed include the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, Tibetan Plateau, land permafrost, Amazon rainforest, Antarctic sea ice, monsoon systems, Arctic summer sea ice, Arctic winter sea ice, and Barents sea ice. Except for the monsoon systems, we found abrupt shifts in all of these across multiple models. Despite large inter‐model variations, higher levels of global warming consistently increase the risk of abrupt shifts in CMIP6 models. At a global warming of 1.5°C, six out of 10 studied climate subsystems already show large‐scale abrupt shifts across multiple models.",

A detailed investigation of the equatorial shadow region confirms that the dense plasmasphere blocks AKR emissions across all wave frequencies. Low‐frequency emissions (&lt;100 kHz) are presents outside the shadow region at larger radial distance, which is attributed to magnetosheath reflection, while higher‐frequency emissions (&gt;100 kHz) propagate via plasmaspheric ducting and leakage, filling the equatorial region immediately outside the plasmasphere. Ray‐tracing simulations identify low‐density ducts within the plasmasphere as crucial channels that enable AKR to penetrate the dense plasmasphere, particularly at higher frequencies.

These differences solely arise from the method used to estimate the fault population strain, which relies on the number of structures. Here, we adapt a previous framework by which the continuum approximation to shortening strains can be determined from fault length and displacement statistics for an incompletely sampled fault population. We apply this method to three data sets that sample different numbers of faults.

Sea level rise is a clear example of the implications of climate change with a further committed rise of at least 2–3 m embedded within the Earth System from +1.5°C of global warming. A bold suggestion to reduce sea level rise is to install underwater barriers to reduce the inflow of oceanic heat around Antarctica and Greenland. Inflow of warm, saline water masses drives ice melt and the destabilization of tidewater glaciers. Whilst the basic theory that barriers would stem oceanic heat flow is uncontroversial, the extent to which barriers might reduce future ice mass loss is less certain. There are numerous concerns about the viability and side‐effects of this proposed intervention. We use existing field observations and representative fjord‐scale models for the Greenland's largest glacier, Sermeq Kujalleq in the Ilulissat Icefjord, to suggest that there is already sufficient evidence to conclude that artificial barrier installation would have negative regional implications for marine productivity. The effects on fisheries are a concern as negative implications for Greenland's regional fisheries are unlikely to be socially acceptable. Increasing “geoengineeringization” of the Earth Sciences is likely to continue in coming decades as society grapples with the challenges of slowing climate change and mitigating its consequences. To produce beneficial results, the technical and social viabilities of geoengineering concepts need to be considered in parallel, with the latter determined in a complex social, economic and cultural nexus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The properties and rheology of subduction zones have been intensively studied to forecast potential megathrust earthquake scenarios. However, in Cascadia, the absence of recent megathrust events limits available seismic evidence. Tectonic tremors occurring downdip of the megathrust provide valuable insights into stress accumulation and propagation and can help constrain stress states and rheology. We build upon a previous method to extract tremor migrations in a large catalog of ∼330,000 tremors, addressing location errors and temporal resolution of the catalog, which are particularly crucial for this region. The spatiotemporally dense tremor activity identified by our improved method, along with the greatly increased number of extracted migrations (∼13,700), facilitates a more quantitative analysis. Our findings suggest that tremor migration is primarily controlled by stress diffusion in a medium exhibiting viscous behavior rather than fluid diffusion. The observed relationship between migration speed and duration implies a diffusivity of 10 3 –10 5 m 2 /s, and aligns with a simple model indicating an approximately 30‐km‐wide zone of slow slip and tremor propagation. Additionally, we identify three along‐strike barriers to tremor migrations, consistent with previously identified segments persisting from shallow to deep. Notably, the barrier near 48.5°N consistently decelerates, terminates, or initiates large tremor episodes, likely due to geometric distortions, including flattening and bending of the slab. In contrast, a barrier near 42.5°N abruptly halts migrations and accumulates stress, but can be breached by sufficient stress perturbation. Thus, tremor migrations can constrain geometric segmentation and diffusive behavior of tremorgenic regions from a dynamic perspective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Synchronous streamflow droughts across multiple river basins can lead to large‐scale water scarcity and disruptions in food and water security. However, the drivers and changes in drought synchronicity across Indian rivers remain unexplored due to the limited length of instrumental records. Using streamflow observations and paleohydrological records, we reconstructed streamflow for 45 gauge stations on major Indian rivers, spanning 1200–2012 C.E., to examine the changes and drivers of streamflow drought synchronicity. Our reconstructed streamflow record for the past ∼800 years shows that streamflow drought frequency and synchronicity have increased during the recent period (1850–2012). While past major synchronous droughts in Indian rivers were associated with El Niño and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions, the recent increase in streamflow drought synchronicity is linked with anthropogenic climate warming. Simulations of the Paleo Model Intercomparison Project Phase 4 (PMIP4‐CMIP6) that include both natural and anthropogenic forcings confirm the role of anthropogenic warming in enhancing drought synchronicity. Our findings provide critical insights into the long‐term variability of droughts in Indian rivers and underscore the growing risk of large‐scale water scarcity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Earth's mid‐latitudes host synoptic scale corridors of intense horizontal moisture transport called atmospheric rivers (ARs). These storms are responsible for substantial heat transport across the mid‐latitudes and deliver large amounts of precipitation to impacted locations. ARs occasionally penetrate the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, resulting in elevated temperatures and anomalous precipitation, which can have a major influence on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), yet the impact ARs may have had on the GrIS in past climates remains unexplored. The Last Interglacial (LIG; 130,000–115,000 years before present) featured a warmer Arctic than present and a smaller GrIS configuration, providing an ideal time period for characterizing how AR impacts on the GrIS respond to orbital forcing and GrIS topography. Here, we use existing simulations spanning the LIG with a dynamic GrIS to study AR behavior around the GrIS. Results show that there are two mechanisms for AR migration through the LIG. There is a dynamical control across the mid‐latitudes through orbitally induced migrations of the prevailing winds and a thermodynamic control at high latitudes due to changes in atmospheric moisture. This results in more warm season ARs at high latitudes early in the LIG which drive substantial melt around the margins of the GrIS and accumulation on the ice sheet interior. Future AR impacts on the GrIS are shown to be similar to the early LIG where an increase in high latitude moisture increases summertime ARs and thus ice sheet ablation around the GrIS margins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Freshwater wetlands are major sources of global methane emissions through biogenic methanogenesis, a process increasingly influenced by climate change. High latitude wetlands are subject to uniquely altered biogeochemical inputs due to disproportionate warming. For example, glacial meltwater delivers metal‐rich sediments that are easily reducible. Additionally, if the wetland is located upon a subduction zone, periodic and dynamic geological forces, such as megathrust earthquakes, can disrupt these systems further. To explore these interactions, we analyzed the genomic potential of microbial communities across a glaciated wetland located in an active forearc region subject to repeated megathrust ruptures. We found that sediment microbial communities contained the complete potential for methanogenesis and iron cycling, yet the relative abundance of key methanogenic genes was reduced in recently deposited freshwater sediments despite high levels of organic matter and iron. These findings suggest that megathrust fault activity and associated uplift exerts broad, abrupt change on microbial metabolic potential, and that overlying sediments reflect modern glacial input which modify the development of metabolic potential. Glacial influence likely disrupts methanogenesis by supporting communities capable of dissimilatory iron reduction, which may increase metal‐dependent methanotrophy. As climate change accelerates glacial melt, extant and newly developing microbial communities will likely respond rapidly to shifting carbon and mineral inputs, altering carbon cycling dynamics in these sensitive ecosystems. Our work links small scale microbial metabolic potential with some of the largest processes on our planet, revealing how cyclical tectonic events can overprint broad scale biogeochemistry by homogenizing microbial metabolisms and disrupting elemental cycling.",

To understand how climate change will impact FT, we conducted field monitoring in the Pekerebetsu River basin, Hokkaido, Japan, and calibrated a numerical model to predict FT changes. Field measurements show that erosion and deposition of colluvium depends on local snow cover, because snow insulates the ground when present and greatly reduces FT cycles. We then generalize our results using a calibrated soil temperature equation and climate model scenarios to predict how FT may change under future climate. When snow cover is ignored, FT is predicted to decrease in the study area due to future warming. However, when insulating effects of snow cover are included, the area is predicted to have little change in FT in some places, and potentially large FT increases in other locations. The impact of decreased snow cover tends to be greater than that of increased temperature.",

Using a 16‐year radio occultation data set observed by Venus Express and Akatsuki, we have, for the first time, revealed the thermal tide structure from the cloud base to mesopause (50–90 km) in the southern hemisphere. The tidal patterns are equatorially symmetric and validated by simulations with the Venus Planetary Climate Model, extending tidal insights beyond the northern hemisphere focus of previous studies. The simulation indicates that diurnal tide‐induced AM flux divergence is the primary driving force for equatorial cloud‐top superrotation, with its meridional and vertical AM flux divergence dominating in the region of ∼5 km above and below the cloud top, respectively.",

In net‐negative emission scenarios, where more CO 2 is extracted from the atmosphere than emitted, we expect global cooling. Little is known about how the ocean will release heat and carbon under such a scenario. Here we use an Earth system model of intermediate complexity and show results of an idealized climate change scenario that, following global warming forced by an atmospheric CO 2 increase of 1% per year until CO 2 doubling, features subsequent sustained net‐negative emissions. After several hundred years of net‐negative emissions and gradual global cooling, abrupt discharge of heat from the ocean leads to a global mean surface temperature increase of several tenths of degrees that lasts for more than a century. This ocean heat “burp” originates from heat that has previously accumulated under global warming in the deep Southern Ocean, and emerges to the ocean surface via deep convection. Little CO 2 is released along with the heat which is largely due to particularities of sea water carbon chemistry. As the ocean heat loss causes an atmospheric temperature increase independent of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations or emissions, it presents a mechanism that introduces a breakdown of the quasi‐linear relationship of cumulative CO 2 emissions and global surface warming, a metric that underpins political decision‐making. We call for assessing the robustness of how models forced with net‐negative CO 2 emissions simulate durability of ocean storage of heat and CO 2 , and pathways of loss to the atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Faults are the products of wear processes acting at a range of scales from nanometers to kilometers. Grooves produced by wear are a first‐order observable feature of preserved surfaces. However, their interpretation is limited by the complex geological histories of natural faults. Here we explore wear processes on faults by forensically examining a large‐scale controlled, laboratory fault which has a maximum offset between the sides of 42 mm and has been reset multiple times for a cumulative slip of approximately 140 mm. We find that on both sides of the fault scratches are formed with lengths that are longer than the maximum offset but less than the cumulative slip. The grooves are explained as a result of interaction with detached gouge rather than as toolmarks produced by an intact protrusion on one side of the fault. The density of grooves increases with normal stress. The experiment has a range of stress of 1–20 MPa and shows a density of 10 grooves/m/MPa in this range. This value is consistent with recent inferences of stress‐dependent earthquake fracture energy of 0.2 J/m 2 /MPa. At normal stresses above 20 MPa, the grooves are likely to coalesce into a corrugated surface that more closely resembles mature faults. Groove density therefore appears to be an attractive target for field studies aiming to determine the distribution of normal stress on faults. At low stresses the groove spacing can be measured and contrasted with areas where high stresses produce a corrugated surface.",

Our best models suggest that a relatively thick stably stratified helium rain‐out layer may extend out to 70% of Saturn’s radius, likely imprinted with weak heat flux out of the equatorial region and strong heat flux out of high latitudes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Many metals present in trace concentrations in the oceans are sensitive to reduction and oxidation reactions (termed redox‐sensitive trace metals or RSTMs) and can therefore be affected during intervals of expanded oceanic anoxia and euxinia (anoxic and sulfidic waters). These RSTMs are important micronutrients; and their availability plays a significant role in controlling metabolic pathways and therefore ecosystem structure. Understanding the links to ecosystem restructuring and potential collapse is important since past deoxygenation events are associated with biological turnover. The Early Jurassic Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T‐OAE) was one such event. We focus on the RSTM molybdenum (Mo), important in the nitrogen cycle, from a basin transect where local redox conditions permit the tracking of the marine reservoir of Mo. Mo enrichments start to decline in the Pliensbachian, continue to decline in the early Toarcian, drop precipitously during the T‐OAE interval, and remain low afterward before a protracted increase toward the initial values seen in the Pliensbachian. From a compilation of available data, we estimate that ∼41 Gt of Mo was buried during the T‐OAE using a range of possible flux estimates. Given the known correlations of Mo with total organic carbon, the estimated burial of organic carbon during the T‐OAE interval was ∼244,000 Gt. This requires a minimum of 3.25% of the ocean floor to be covered by euxinic waters. Finally, we suggest that the intervals traditionally classified as OAEs are associated with the greatest extent of euxinia.",

Most forest die‐off projections assume that recent tree mortality will not alter die‐off severity during subsequent droughts. We tested this assumption by comparing die‐off in semi‐arid conifer forest stands in California that were exposed to a single drought in 2012–2015 (“ 2nd Drought Only ”) with forest stands that experienced drought in both 1999–2002 and 2012–2015 (“ Both Droughts ”). We quantified die‐off severity as a reduction in the satellite observed Normalized Difference Moisture Index, and cumulative moisture deficit as negative 4‐year Precipitation minus Evapotranspiration (4‐year Pr‐ET overdraft). Here we show that recent tree morality reduces die‐off severity in semi‐arid conifer forests exposed to subsequent drought. Stands in the 2nd Drought Only sample experienced severe die‐off associated with extreme 4‐year Pr‐ET overdraft in 2012–2015. Stands in the Both Droughts sample experienced severe die‐off and 4‐year Pr‐ET overdraft in 1999–2002, but comparatively little 2012–2015 die‐off despite continued 4‐year Pr‐ET overdraft. We interpret this as a dampening effect, where prior tree mortality reduces forest die‐off severity during subsequent drought exposure. As forests continue to experience disturbances linked to climate change, dampening effects will impose a transient, and perhaps long‐term, constraint on the impact of repeated drought.",

The origins of these interfaces are poorly understood due to the difficulties in both characterizing them seismically and reconciling the observations with thermal‐chemical models of cratons. Metasomatism of the cratonic lithosphere has been reported by numerous geochemical and petrological studies worldwide, yet its seismic signature remains elusive. Here, we identify two distinct mid‐lithosphere discontinuities at ∼87 and ∼117 km depth beneath the eastern Wyoming craton and the southwestern Superior craton by analyzing seismic data recorded by two longstanding stations. Our waveform modeling shows that the shallow and deep interfaces represent isotropic velocity drops of 2%–8% and 4%–9%, respectively, depending on the contributions from changes in radial anisotropy and density. By building a thermal‐chemical model including the regional xenolith thermobarometry constraints and the experimental phase‐equilibrium data of mantle metasomatism, we show that the shallow interface probably represents the metasomatic front, below which hydrous minerals such as amphibole and phlogopite are present, whereas the deep interface may be caused by the onset of carbonated partial melting. The hydrous minerals and melts are products of mantle metasomatism, with CO 2 ‐H 2 O‐rich siliceous melt as a probable metasomatic reagent. Our results suggest that mantle metasomatism is probably an important cause of mid‐lithosphere discontinuities worldwide, especially near craton boundaries, where the mantle lithosphere may be intensely metasomatized by fluids and melts released by subducting slabs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Agulhas Current, like other western boundary currents (WBCs), transports nutrients laterally from the tropics to the subtropics in a subsurface “nutrient stream.” These nutrients are predominantly supplied to surface waters by seasonal convective mixing, to fuel a brief period of productivity before phytoplankton become nutrient‐limited. Episodic mixing events characteristic of WBC systems can temporarily alleviate nutrient scarcity by vertically entraining deep nutrients into surface waters. However, our understanding of these nutrient fluxes is lacking because they are spatio‐temporally limited, and once they enter the sunlit layer, the nutrients are rapidly consumed by phytoplankton. Here, we use a novel application of nitrate Δ(15–18), the difference between the nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate, to characterize three (sub)mesoscale events of upward nitrate supply across the Agulhas Current in winter: (1) mixing at the edges of an anticyclonic eddy, (2) inshore upwelling associated with a submesoscale meander of the Agulhas Current, and (3) overturning at the edge of the current core driven by submesoscale instabilities. All three events manifest as upward injections of high‐Δ(15–18) nitrate into the thermocline and surface where nitrate Δ(15–18) is otherwise low; these entrainment events are not always apparent in the other co‐collected data. The dynamics driving the nitrate supply events are common to all WBCs, implying that nutrient entrainment facilitated by WBCs is quantitatively significant and supports productivity in otherwise oligotrophic subtropical surface waters. A future rise in energy across WBC systems may increase these nutrient fluxes, partly offsetting the predicted stratification‐induced decrease in subtropical ocean fertility.",

The technique relies on localized upwelling at the bottomside F layer, characterized by the second time derivative of the base height of the F layer observed by ionosonde, as the prime criterion deciding whether EPB will be formed overhead or not. Results show that prediction for the formation of EPB over an ionosonde station can be made with an accuracy of 99.86%. The accuracy of prediction of EPB formation over a station using data from a nearby station separated by 3.2° in longitude, however, is found to be only 83.87%, underlining the crucial role of longitudinally localized background ionospheric conditions at the bottom of the F region.

Except for four typical aseismic creep events, two events represent earthquakes whose waveforms were obscured within the coda waves of the mainshocks. Notably, we find two silent events that did not radiate discernible high‐frequency seismic energy nor produce local aftershocks but did exhibit high stress drops of 4–6 MPa, similar to regular earthquakes. These two “silent” events likely represent a new fault slip mode positioned between regular earthquakes and SSEs. The identification of these diverse shallow slip events, which are missed in seismic catalogs, calls for reevaluation of faulting mechanisms, the nature of static/dynamic triggering effects, and seismic hazard assessments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Missouri River streamflow increased substantially during the 20th century, with multiple large floods occurring since 1990. Using land surface models and water budget simulations, we examined the extent to which increased flow was driven by natural climate variability, anthropogenic climate trends, land‐use and land‐cover change (LULCC), and ecological effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 . Natural climate variability (arising largely from coupled ocean‐atmosphere circulation systems in both the Pacific and North Atlantic) accounted for ∼765 m 3 s −1 of the ∼900 m 3 s −1 increase in flow since mid‐century, while anthropogenic climate trends negatively forced flow by increasing evapotranspiration more than precipitation. LULCC and elevated CO 2 further increased simulated mean streamflow by ∼550 and ∼70 m 3 s −1 , respectively, relative to pre‐Industrial conditions and ∼100 and ∼65 m 3 s −1 relative to mid‐20th century conditions. The LULCC effect was especially large in wet years, implying that current land cover is ill‐suited for buffering against extreme precipitation, likely in large part due to replacement of forest by cropland in the lower basin. Because increases in Missouri River flow over the past century were driven mostly by a recent (and likely transient) pluvial, our results suggest that flow in the basin could revert to a drier mean state when that pluvial ends, likely made worse by increased evaporative demand from anthropogenic warming.",

With the original goal of constraining natural fluxes at regional to global scales, these instruments have now become popular tools for studying anthropogenic emissions from cities around the world. As signatories of the Paris Climate Agreement are expected to produce nationally determined contributions (NDC) to global carbon emissions, continued monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of these estimates will be essential. While the use of OCO‐2 and OCO‐3 missions for MRV purposes is increasing, several physical and environmental factors limit data collection. Using the continental United States as a test case, the influences of orbital mechanics and environmental factors on local‐ and national‐level emissions estimates are explored through a series of linear and multi‐linear regressions to predict each instrument's effective revisit time. Results suggest that, due to environmental factors, western regions of the U.S. are more likely to be constrained at a sub‐annual scale than eastern regions, with effective instrument revisit times days. East coast cities have effective revisit times days; however, this varies seasonally. The characteristics of the instruments' orbits also vary the frequency of urban observations in both space and time. Implications for observation‐derived emission estimates at local and national scales and remedies for such shortcomings in future missions are discussed.",

In deriving chemical budgets and climate trends, which differ across spheres, we need clearly defined boundaries. Our primary spheres are the troposphere and stratosphere (∼99.9% by mass), and the boundary between them is the tropopause. Every global climate‐weather model has one or more methods to calculate the lapse rate tropopause, but these involve subjective choices and are known to fail near the sub‐tropical jets and polar regions. Age‐of‐air tracers clock the effective time‐distance from the tropopause, allowing unambiguous separation of stratosphere from troposphere in the chaotic jet regions. We apply a global model with synthetic tracer e90 (90‐day e‐folding), focusing on ozone and temperature structures about the tropopause using ozone sonde and satellite observations. We calibrate an observation‐consistent tropopause for e90 using tropics‐plus‐midlatitudes and then apply it globally to calculate total tropospheric air‐mass and tropopause ozone values. The tropopause mixing barrier for the current UCI CTM is identified by a transition in the vertical transport gradient to stratospheric values of 15 days km −1 , corresponding to an e90 tropopause at 81 ± 2 ppb with a global tropospheric air mass of 82.2 ± 0.3%. The best e90 tropopause based on sonde pressures is 70–80 ppb; but that for ozone is 80–90 ppb, implying that the CTM tropopause ozone values are too large. This approach of calibrating an age‐of‐air tropopause can be readily applied to other models and possibly used with observed age‐of‐air tracers like sulfur hexafluoride.",

This Bedrock Vadose Zone (BVZ) has been shown to store and circulate water, host organic carbon respiration and serve as a critical source of rock‐derived nutrients. However, the extent to which deep roots influence chemical weathering rates remains poorly understood. Here, we report 4 years of depth‐resolved major ion chemistry over a 16‐m thick BVZ hosting a deep rhizosphere in a catchment subject to a Mediterranean climate. These data allow development and validation of a reactive transport model (RTM), revealing that the timescales of water storage and drainage in the BVZ are sufficient to facilitate substantial chemical weathering of the shale bedrock. However, observed solute concentrations are only reproduced by the RTM when we explicitly include measured rates of production meters below soil driven by the deeply rooted forest. By combining direct observations and a process‐based RTM we conclude that the carbon respiration promoted by deep roots significantly enhances chemical weathering rates in the BVZ, constituting 43% 3% of total solute flux from the base of the BVZ to the water table.",

Recent research has highlighted a positive trend in jet stream waviness from 1990 to 2010, with a hypothesized connection to Arctic amplification of anthropogenic warming. However, an increase in jet stream waviness has also been hypothesized to contribute to the winter “warming hole” (WH) in eastern North America, a cooling phenomenon from 1958–1988, beginning several decades prior to the recent waviness trend. These potentially conflicting hypotheses highlight the uncertainty of long‐term jet stream waviness variability prior to the satellite era (1979–present). Here we develop a new record of wintertime jet stream waviness spanning 1901–2023 based on self‐organizing maps and nine different temperature and reanalysis data sets with the dual purpose of (a) understanding the historical variability of polar jet stream waviness in the eastern United States, and (b) quantifying the impact of jet stream waviness on WH‐era surface temperatures. Our analysis reveals elevated jet stream waviness in the 1960s–1980s that surpassed modern waviness levels, and we find that jet stream waviness contributed to two‐thirds of winter WH cooling beginning in 1958. These results are consistent with a strong connection between temperature trends in the eastern U.S. and jet stream troughing but indicate that additional mechanisms also contributed to the WH. Our analysis further highlights that recent increases in jet stream waviness are well within the range of early to mid‐20th century variability, prior to the emergence of Arctic amplification.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Observational analyses consistently find that yields of major rainfed crops increase with temperature up to a threshold of approximately 32C, above which they reduce sharply. Two damage pathways have been suggested to explain this relationship: that high temperatures directly stress crops and drive yield loss, or that high temperatures induce water stress in crops, which in turn drives yield loss. Here we explore a third pathway: that soil water stress limits both agricultural productivity and evaporative cooling, giving rise to the nonlinear relationship between temperature and yield. Determining which of these pathways underpins the yield‐temperature relationship is important for predicting future crop productivity because climate change is expected to alter the co‐variability between temperature and water availability. To examine this third pathway, we use cumulative growing‐season transpiration from an idealized land surface model as a proxy for yield. This approach reproduces the observed yield‐temperature relationship, even though the model includes no mechanisms that limit productivity at high temperatures. In experiments where the influence of temperature on soil moisture is suppressed, yields still decline during hot, dry periods in a manner consistent with the observations. We conclude that water stress, and its influence on evaporative cooling, temperature, and agricultural productivity, drives the yield‐temperature relationship found in crops that experience episodic water stress. This framework explains the muted sensitivity of irrigated yields to high atmospheric temperatures, and suggests that future yield outcomes depend more critically on changes in rainfall than suggested by estimates that attribute yield losses primarily to temperature variations.",

In contrast, model simulations of 21st‐century stratospheric temperature changes show widespread cooling driven by increasing greenhouse gases, with local warming in the Antarctic lower stratosphere due to ozone healing. We provide evidence that these discrepancies between observed and simulated stratospheric temperature changes are linked to a slowdown of the Brewer‐Dobson Circulation, particularly in the SH. These changes in the stratospheric circulation are strongest from October through December. This altered circulation warms the SH subtropical lower stratosphere while cooling the Antarctic lower stratosphere, canceling and even reversing the Antarctic ozone recovery that would have occurred in its absence during this period. When circulation changes are accounted for, the SH subtropical lower‐stratospheric warming is removed, and Antarctic lower‐stratospheric warming is revealed with enhanced ozone healing, highlighting the crucial role of the stratospheric circulation in shaping temperature and ozone changes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Permafrost, a critical global cryospheric component, supports subarctic boreal forests but is frequently disturbed by wildfires, an important driver of permafrost degradation. Wildfires reduce vegetation, organic layers, and surface albedo, leading to active layer thickening and ground subsidence. Recent studies using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) have confirmed the rapid and extensive post‐fire permafrost degradation, and have largely focused on short‐term impacts. However, the longer‐term post‐fire permafrost deformation, potentially persisting for decades, remains poorly understood due to limited data. Here, we applied InSAR in North Yukon to detect deformation signals across multiple fire scars in the past five decades. Using a chronosequence (space‐for‐time substitution) approach, we summarize a continuous trajectory of post‐fire permafrost evolution: (a) an initial degradation stage, characterized by abrupt subsidence up to 50 mm/year and gradually slowing over the first decade, with cumulative subsidence exceeding 100 mm locally; (b) an aggradation stage from approximately 15 to 30 years after fire, marked by ground uplift reaching 25 mm/year before gradually declining, compensating for the earlier subsidence; and (c) a stabilization stage beyond three to four decades, where permafrost nearly recovers to pre‐fire conditions with indistinguishable deformation between burned and unburned areas. Notably, the rarely‐reported uplift phase appears closely related to vegetation regeneration and fire‐greening feedback that provide thermal protection, suggesting a critical mechanism of permafrost recovery. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of boreal‐permafrost systems to wildfires and also underscore the importance of long‐term InSAR monitoring in understanding permafrost responses to wildfires under climate change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the interplay of various energy sinks during seismic fault slip is essential for advancing earthquake physics and improving hazard assessment. However, quantifying the energy consumed by major dissipative processes remains a challenge. In this study, we investigate energy partitioning during laboratory earthquakes (“lab‐quakes”) by performing general shear stick‐slip experiments on synthetic granitic cataclasites at elevated confining pressure. Using ultrasound, microstructural, and novel magnetism‐based thermal analyses, we independently quantified the energy allocated to seismic radiation, new surfaces, and heat dissipation. These estimates showed good agreement with far‐field measurements of mechanical work during the lab‐quake. Our findings revealed that under the experimental conditions the majority of the released energy (68%–98%) is dissipated as heat, while seismic radiation accounts for 1%–8%, and the creation of new surfaces consumes &lt;1%–32%. Microstructural observations indicate pre‐failure deformation, which includes comminution and development of the principal slip zone, significantly influences energy partitioning. This effect is further evident in the measured shear stress drops, where events with higher stress drops proportionally emitted more energy as seismic waves. This study is the first to constrain the full energy budget of lab‐quakes from an observational standpoint, providing critical insights into the dynamics of fault rupture and energy dissipation processes.",

Understanding and quantifying the impacts of such MHWs on land heatwaves can enhance seasonal prediction skills for these extremes. Here we evaluate the impact of the 2023 MHW on the record‐breaking atmospheric heatwave in East Asia during the summer. Through a set of regional atmospheric model experiments, we demonstrate that the MHW significantly exacerbated the 2023 East Asian summer atmospheric heatwave, particularly as a compound hot‐humid extreme. The extremely warm ocean amplified both surface air temperature and humidity anomalies, on top of the contributions of background atmospheric circulation anomalies. The MHW influence on air temperature manifests through radiative effects of cloud and water vapor changes. Our results also indicate that the atmospheric heatwave amplifies despite the MHW acts to dampen the western North Pacific subtropical high against large‐scale background atmospheric conditions. By examining the effects of both temperature and humidity anomalies through wet‐bulb globe temperature, we find that the MHW explains ∼20%–50% of the aggravation and prolonged duration of hot‐humid conditions in East Asia, with notable impacts in Japan. Additionally, the recent trend of sea surface warming is shown to substantially amplify the MHW's impact on the heatwave. Our findings underscore the key role of ocean variability and air–sea interactions in surrounding oceans on atmospheric heatwaves that occur in the summer climate in East Asia, highlighting a unique process in the humid and low cloud‐abundant maritime East Asia region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Coccolithophores are a group of marine phytoplankton precipitating about 50% of total calcite carbonate in the surface ocean. During the Pleistocene, coccolithophores experienced several periodic high‐abundance and dominance intervals (acmes) that significantly altered the ocean carbon cycle by increasing the production of carbonate in the ocean. However, the reason for these episodes of enhanced calcification is still unclear. Here, we focus on one of the most significant dominance intervals, the Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica acme event, that lasted between ∼500 and 300 thousand years ago. We find that the variations of seawater alkalinity made only a minor contribution to the increased calcification rates during coccolithophore blooms. Rather, coccolithophore carbon isotopic fractionation indicates that coccolithophores employed a stronger bicarbonate pumping to increase intracellular carbon availability. Greater nutrient availability and shallower living depth likely facilitated higher bicarbonate pumping rates. The upregulation of bicarbonate pumping indicates the vital role of nutrients and light, and not only the ocean carbonate system, in the evolution of marine phytoplankton. Models of future coccolithophore calcification response to changing ocean carbon chemistry would, therefore, benefit from a more comprehensive consideration of how light and nutrient availability affect cellular energy budgets and drive carbon uptake.",

The degrees to which contemporary and climate trends drive this absorption are uncertain, as are the governing mechanisms. To reduce uncertainty, we use Bayesian model‐data integration (CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework) to retrieve a terrestrial biosphere reanalysis where Earth Observations optimally inform mechanistic model processes: observations include satellite‐ and inventory‐based constraints on distributions and change in terrestrial C (including live biomass, dead organic C, and land‐atmosphere exchanges) and underlying mechanisms (including photosynthesis, deforestation, water storage anomalies, and fire). We find that the impact of 2001–2021's atmospheric increase on terrestrial C (+39.4 PgC) opposes and far outweighs the impact of climate trends over this period (10.5 PgC). Globally, C gains are mostly attributable to live biomass growth (+31.2 PgC), while ‐induced dead organic C gains (+7.8 PgC) are compensated by climate‐induced losses (8.8 PgC). The distribution of compensating dead C changes induces an aggregate shift in dead C from high‐ and mid‐latitudes (3.5 PgC) to tropical ecosystems (+2.6 PgC). We additionally find global residence time reductions attributable to (2.6%) and climate (1.3%) reflected across latitudes, irrespective of reservoir C changes. In aggregate, these changes reveal an acceleration and redistribution of terrestrial C stores in response to and climate trends, which together reflect a gradual but fundamental reorganization of the terrestrial C cycle. Tracking this reorganization—through robust and continual diagnosis of ecosystem function—is essential for accurately resolving the compensating dynamics governing the strength and resilience of the terrestrial C sink.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The evolution of the spatial pattern of ocean surface warming affects global radiative feedback, yet different climate models provide varying estimates of future patterns. Paleoclimate data, especially from past warm periods, can help constrain future equilibrium warming patterns. By analyzing marine temperature records spanning the past 10 million years with a regression‐based technique that removes temporal dimensions, we extract long‐term ocean warming patterns and quantify relative sea surface temperature changes across the global ocean. This analysis revealed a distinct pattern of amplified warming that aligns with equilibrated model simulations under high CO 2 conditions, yet differs from the transient warming pattern observed over the past 160 years. This paleodata‐model comparison allows us to identify models that better capture fundamental aspects of Earth's warming response, while suggesting how ocean heat uptake and circulation changes modify the development of warming patterns over time. By combining this paleo‐ocean warming pattern with equilibrated model simulations, we characterized the likely evolution of global ocean warming as the climate system approaches equilibrium.",

Thanks to their high spectral and spatial resolution and over a decade of experience from the project and the science teams, these missions have set a gold standard for space‐based retrievals of SIF. Both instruments remain healthy and continue to produce high‐quality data that offer great potential to continue transforming our fundamental understanding of terrestrial ecology and to provide actionable information to manage risks associated with extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and wildfires.

    "abstract": "Abstract Venus' thick atmosphere rotates in the same direction as the solid body, but ∼60 times faster. This atmospheric superrotation has produced dozens of windblown ejecta deposits (“parabolas”) on the surface of Venus. The formation and modification of parabolas is an interplay between impacts, aeolian modification, and atmospheric dynamics. We conducted a survey to explore the nature of these sedimentary surface features. First, we observe trends in parabolas' morphology that shed light on how they are deposited and gradated. Changes in the size and radar albedo of parabolas are likely linked to the height and density (respectively) of ejecta plumes at time of formation. Next, we discovered that parabolas show orientations inconsistent with present atmospheric dynamics. This discrepancy may record a change in these dynamics or geologically recent true polar wander at a rate of ∼1° Myr −1 , which is similar to that observed on Earth over the past century. These results highlight how overlapping observations at different radar wavelengths provide important insights into the history and character of geologic processes on Venus. Overall, atmospheric superrotation has probably persisted for at least the age of Venus' surface.",

To understand the role of these environments during hyperthermals, we herein investigate the Permian–Triassic environmental crisis, which led to the most severe mass extinction event in the Phanerozoic. Our analysis of siliciclastic deposits from the Boreal Ocean from Lusitaniadalen, Svalbard, reveals a distinct increase of the lipid biomarkers C 33 ‐ n ‐alkylcyclohexane (C 33 ‐ n ‐ACH) and phytanyl toluene following the extinction event. This increase does not appear to reflect facies changes. Rather, it coincides with the extinction horizon, and persists into the lowermost Triassic (Griesbachian). Our findings suggest that neither C 33 ‐ n ‐ACH nor phytanyl toluene are linked to short periods of photic zone euxinia recorded at Lusitaniadalen, but rather are derived from a specific group of phytoplankton. This indicates that higher‐latitude ecosystems may have supported regional blooms of unknown primary producers after the Permian–Triassic mass extinction, thus explaining the selective survival of some marine organisms. We also identify (albeit in lower abundance) C 33 ‐ n ‐ACH and its pseudohomologs in northern Italy, which is the first report of n ‐ACHs in the tropical Tethys region across the Permian–Triassic transition outside of South China, highlighting the wide paleogeographic distribution of this biomarker. Phytanyl toluene, however, is found exclusively in deposits recording higher‐latitude ecosystems, and is likely linked to organisms occupying a similar ecological niche as the source organism of C 33 ‐ n ‐ACH in these settings.",

Satellite observations can provide spatio‐temporal information on dust emission and transport pathways. However, satellite observations of dust plumes are frequently obscured by clouds. We use a method based on established, machine‐learning‐based image in‐painting techniques to restore the spatial extent of dust plumes for the first time. We train an artificial neural net (ANN) on modern reanalysis data paired with satellite‐derived cloud masks. The trained ANN is applied to cloud‐masked, gray‐scaled images, which were derived from false color images indicating elevated dust plumes in bright magenta. The images were obtained from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager instrument onboard the Meteosat Second Generation satellite. We find up to 15% of summertime observations in West Africa and 10% of summertime observations in Nubia by satellite images miss dust plumes due to cloud cover. We use the new dust‐plume data to demonstrate a novel approach for validating spatial patterns of the operational forecasts provided by the World Meteorological Organization Dust Regional Center in Barcelona. The comparison elucidates often similar dust plume patterns in the forecasts and the satellite‐based reconstruction, but once trained, the reconstruction is computationally inexpensive. Our proposed reconstruction provides a new opportunity for validating dust aerosol transport in numerical weather models and Earth system models. It can be adapted to other aerosol species and trace gases.",

An accurate quantification of the energy input and ionization due to EEP is still lacking due to instrument limitations of low‐Earth‐orbit satellites capable of detecting EEP. The deployment of the Electron Losses and Fields InvestigatioN (ELFIN) CubeSats marks a new era of observations of EEP with an improved pitch‐angle (0°–180°) and energy (50 keV–6 MeV) resolution. Here, we focus on the EEP recorded by ELFIN coincident with electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, which play a major role in radiation belt electron losses. The EMIC‐driven EEP (∼200 keV–∼2 MeV) exhibits a pitch‐angle distribution (PAD) that flattens with increasing energy, indicating more efficient high‐energy precipitation. Leveraging the combination of unique electron measurements from ELFIN and a comprehensive ionization model known as Boulder Electron Radiation to Ionization (BERI), we quantify the energy input of EMIC‐driven precipitation (on average, ∼3.3 × 10 −2 erg/cm 2 /s), identify its location (any longitude, 50°–70° latitude), and provide the expected range of ion‐electron production rate (on average, 100–200 pairs/cm 3 /s), peaking in the mesosphere—a region often overlooked. Our findings are crucial for improving our understanding of the magnetosphere‐ionosphere‐atmosphere system as they accurately specify the contribution of EMIC‐driven EEP, which serves as a crucial input to state‐of‐the‐art atmospheric models (e.g., WACCM) to quantify the accurate impact of EMIC waves on both the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics.",

Presently, measures of the in‐situ distribution of fault damage remain limited and along‐strike studies are rare. This study focuses on an offshore section Palos Verdes Fault damage zone that spans 28 km, near Los Angeles, California. To investigate the previously unresolved shallow (∼400 m below the seafloor) fault damage zone we use densely spaced (∼500 m line separation) newly collected sparker multichannel seismic lines and sub‐bottom profiles. The combination of high‐resolution acquisition methods and specialized seismic processing workflows provide improved imaging of shallow faulting. We apply a multi‐trace similarity technique to identify discontinuities in the seismic data that may be attributed to faults and fractures. This fault detection approach reveals diverse fault damage patterns on adjacent seismic profiles. However, a discernible damage zone pattern emerges by stacking multiple damage detection profiles along strike. We find that peak damage identified in this way corresponds to the active main fault strand, confirmed in this study, and thus the technique may be useful for identifying active fault strands elsewhere. Additionally, we observe that the variable width of the damage zone along strike is controlled by fault obliquity. Furthermore, our observations reveal a correlation between fault damage and seafloor fluid seeps visible in the water column, suggesting that damage plays a role in controlling fluid flow around the fault.",

Estimates of the organic mass fraction of sea spray vary widely, and some results show a significant dependence on biological activity in the source seawater. We present airborne observations of the organic mass fraction of individual sea spray particles measured using the Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry (PALMS) instrument during the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission, which sampled a wide range of latitudes and altitudes over the remote Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across four seasons, from the marine boundary layer to the upper troposphere. The measured sea spray particles of about 0.15–0.7 μm dry diameter showed higher average organic mass fractions at smaller sizes, but values were low overall, with regional integrated submicron means almost always &lt;10%. Atmospheric aging adds organics to sea spray particles, leading to higher mean organic mass fractions (sometimes exceeding 50%) in the free troposphere than in the marine boundary layer. The average submicron sea spray organic mass fractions are on the low end of previously reported values and show weak seasonal variability for most regions. These results imply that recent biological activity in the surface ocean has only weak control over how much organic matter is in nascent submicron sea spray particles over the remote oceans, in contrast to findings from some observational studies and global numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the 2015–2016 El Niño, the Amazon basin released almost one gigaton of carbon (GtC) into the atmosphere due to extreme temperatures and drought. The link between the drought impact and recovery of the total carbon pools and its biogeochemical drivers is still unknown. With satellite‐constrained net carbon exchange and its component fluxes including gross primary production and fire emissions, we show that the total carbon loss caused by the 2015–2016 El Niño had not recovered by the end of 2018. Forest ecosystems over the Northeastern (NE) Amazon suffered a cumulative total carbon loss of ∼0.6 GtC through December 2018, driven primarily by a suppression of photosynthesis whereas southeastern savannah carbon loss was driven in part by fire. We attribute the slow recovery to the unexpected large carbon loss caused by the severe atmospheric aridity coupled with a water storage deficit during drought. We show the attenuation of carbon uptake is three times higher than expected from the pre‐drought sensitivity to atmospheric aridity and ground water supply. Our study fills an important knowledge gap in our understanding of the unexpectedly enhanced response of carbon fluxes to atmospheric aridity and water storage deficit and its impact on regional post‐drought recovery as a function of the vegetation types and climate perturbations. Our results suggest that the disproportionate impact of water supply and demand could compromise resiliency of the Amazonian carbon balance to future increases in extreme events.",

This scaling, while robust and defensible, has known limitations in representing carbon source limitations and spatial variability. Here, we develop and calibrate a CO 2 transport model for the continental United States, simulating carbon transport and transformation in &gt;22 million hydraulically connected rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. We estimate 25% lower CO 2 fluxes compared to upscaling estimates forced by the same observational calibration data. While precise CO 2 source distribution estimates are limited by the resolution of model parameterizations, our model suggests that stream corridor CO 2 production dominates over groundwater inputs at the continental scale. Our results further suggest that the lack of observational networks for groundwater CO 2 and scalable metabolic models of aquatic CO 2 production remain the most salient barriers to further coupling of our model with other Earth system components.",

Prior to the mid‐Mesozoic, tepee structures and pisoids – features associated with peritidal environments – co‐vary with available shelf area during cycles of supercontinent formation and rifting. In contrast, tepees and pisoids are consistently scarce after the mid‐Mesozoic, which coincides with a radiation in pelagic calcifiers as well as the breakup of Pangea. Numerical models suggest that the global and temporal abundances of tepee structures and pisoids are correlated with secular shifts in seawater chemistry, and that trends likely reflect the underlying influence of tectonics and biotic innovation on marine alkalinity and the saturation states of carbonate minerals. As independent sedimentary proxies, tepees and pisoids serve as benchmarks for global carbon cycle models and provide a new proxy record of seawater chemistry that can help discern links among tectonics, biotic innovation, and seawater chemistry.",

We employ an exponential distance‐decay model that confirms the presence of a higher frequency of surface water loss in the proximity of human settlements and provides innovative insights on surface water loss patterns at different spatial scales (i.e., river basins, water resource regions, and the CONUS). These spatial patterns are found to be influenced by climatic conditions, with more widely distributed losses in arid regions with respect to temperate and continental climates. Our results provide a new and deeper understanding of the spatial influence of urban areas on surface water loss, which could be effectively integrated in the definition of sustainable strategies for urbanization, water management, and surface water restoration, focused on both human and environmental water needs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The variability of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical large‐scale circulation is dominated by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), whose timescale is extensively used as a key metric in evaluating state‐of‐the‐art climate models. Past observational and theoretical studies suggest that the SAM lacks any internally generated (intrinsic) periodicity. Here, we show, using observations and a climate model hierarchy, that the SAM has an intrinsic 150‐day periodicity. This periodicity is robustly detectable in the power spectra and principal oscillation patterns (aka dynamical mode decomposition) of the zonal‐mean circulation, and in hemispheric‐scale precipitation and ocean surface wind stress. The 150‐day period is consistent with the predictions of a new reduced‐order model for the SAM, which suggests that this periodicity is associated with a complex interaction of turbulent eddies and zonal wind anomalies, as the latter propagate from low to high latitudes. These findings present a rare example of periodic oscillations arising from the internal dynamics of the extratropical turbulent circulations. Based on these findings, we further propose a new metric for evaluating climate models, and show that some of the previously reported shortcomings and improvements in simulating SAM's variability connect to the models' ability in reproducing this periodicity. We argue that this periodicity should be considered in evaluating climate models and understanding the past, current, and projected Southern Hemisphere climate variability.",

When convection is unaggregated, vertical velocity profiles are top‐heavy, mixing ratios increase and water vapor δD decreases as the mean precipitation rate increases, consistent with partial hydrometeor evaporation below anvils into a relatively humid atmospheric column. Aggregated convection is associated with bottom‐heavy vertical velocity profiles and a positive correlation between mixing ratio and δD , a result that is consistent with isotopic enrichment from detrainment of shallow convection near the observation level. Intermediate degrees of aggregation do not display significant variation in δD with mixing ratio or precipitation rate. Convective aggregation provides a useful paradigm for understanding the relationships between mixing ratio and isotopic composition across a range of convective settings. The results presented here may have utility for a variety of applications including the interpretation of paleoclimate archives and the evaluation of numerical simulations of convection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The monitoring of wildfire smoke is important to help mitigate impacts on people such as by sending early warnings to affected areas. Received signal levels (RSLs) from radio links have been used as an opportunistic way to accurately measure rainfall and humidity. Radio links provide integrated measurements along their paths and are an exceptional untapped resource to complement air quality stations in areas affected by smoke events, or in developing countries without air quality monitoring capability. This study analyzed radio link signal fluctuations during smoke events associated with the 2019–2020 Australian wildfires. Concurrently, the atmospheric boundary layer was characterized using atmospheric soundings and surface observations, as well as air quality proxies such as particulate matter concentrations less than 2.5 μm (10 μm), or PM 2.5 (PM 10 ). Observations showed that dry air containing large amounts of smoke within a surface layer above the ground acted as a lid, reducing dispersion, trapping and maintaining high ground‐level concentrations of smoke. These conditions also created anomalous propagation conditions for radio links and operational weather radars. Power‐law relations between signal fluctuations and PM 10 and PM 2.5 were derived based on the link data collected and the closest air quality station observations. While there was variability in retrieval performance across smoke events, the best performance determination coefficients exceeded 0.5, with an RMSE on the order of less than 50 μg m −3 for concentrations of more than 400 μg m −3 . Mid‐range link lengths (5–20 km) provided the best results.",

They can propagate thousands of kilometers before breaking in shoaling bathymetry and the ensuing turbulent mixing affects coastal processes and climate feedbacks. Despite their importance, internal waves are intrinsically difficult to detect as they result in only minor amplitude deflection of the sea surface; the need for global detection and long time series of internal waves motivates a search for geophysical detection methods. The pressure coupling of a propagating internal wave with the sloping seafloor provides a potential mechanism to generate seismically observable signals. We use data from the South China Sea where exceptional oceanographic and satellite time series are available for comparison to identify internal wave signals in an onshore passive seismic data set for the first time. We analyze potential seismic signals on broadband seismometers in the context of corroborating oceanographic and satellite data available near Dongsha Atoll in May–June 2019 and find a promising correlation between transient seismic tilt signals and internal wave arrivals and collisions in oceanic and satellite data. It appears that we have successfully detected oceanic internal waves using a subaerial seismometer. This initial detection suggests that the onshore seismic detection and amplitude determination of oceanic internal waves is possible and can potentially be used to expand the historical record by capitalizing on existing island and coastal seismic stations.",

This study uses a general circulation model and an energy balance model (EBM) to assess the parameters that govern the seasonal cycle. We define two metrics to describe the seasonal cycle, ϕ s , the latitudinal shift of the maximum temperature, and Δ T , the maximum seasonal temperature variation amplitude. We show that alongside the expected dependence on the obliquity and orbital period, where seasonality generally strengthens with an increase in these parameters, the seasonality depends in a nontrivial way on the rotation rate. While the seasonal amplitude decreases as the rotation rate slows down, the latitudinal shift, ϕ s , shifts poleward. A similar result occurs in a diffusive EBM with increasing diffusivity. These results suggest that the influence of the rotation rate on the seasonal cycle stems from the effect of the rotation rate on the atmospheric heat transport.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is widely believed that precipitation extremes will increase in response to a warming climate, as inferred from both observations and numerical simulations. In the absence of changes in atmospheric circulations, extreme precipitation is expected to increase in already‐moist regions along a thermodynamical Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling. However, within the tropics, the sensitivities inferred from observations of interannual variability are roughly twice as large, implying an unknown contribution from atmospheric dynamics. In this paper, we use satellite observations and climate model simulations to investigate the relationship between convective aggregation and precipitation and the role that convective aggregation plays in amplifying the response of tropical precipitation extremes to interannual surface warming. We find that the occurrence of heavier precipitation coincides with a higher degree of convective aggregation. Extreme precipitation events and convective aggregation tend to increase during warm, El Niño events compared to colder, La Niña events. Although both the frequency and intensity of heavy to extreme precipitation can increase with increased aggregation during El Niño, the changes in frequency are more consistent among the observations and models than changes in intensity. In both the observations and models, increases in large‐scale convective aggregation contribute to roughly one third of the increase in extreme precipitation frequency due to interannual warming by shifting moderate‐to‐heavy precipitation events to more extreme precipitation intensities. The linkages between convective aggregation and precipitation extremes considered here offer insights into their potential response to anthropogenic warming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The lower cell of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is sourced by dense Antarctic Bottom Waters (AABWs), which form and sink around Antarctica and subsequently fill the abyssal ocean. For the MOC to “overturn,” these dense waters must upwell via mixing with lighter waters above. Here, we investigate the processes underpinning such mixing, and the resulting water mass transformation, using an observationally forced, high‐resolution numerical model of the Drake Passage in the Southern Ocean. In the Drake Passage, the mixing of dense AABW formed in the Weddell Sea with lighter deep waters transported from the Pacific Ocean by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is catalyzed by energetic flows impinging on rough topography. We find that multiple topographic interaction processes facilitate the mixing of the two water masses, ultimately resulting in the upwelling of waters with neutral density greater than 28.19 kg m −3 , and the downwelling of the lighter waters above. In particular, we identify the role of sharp density interfaces between AABW and overlying waters and find that the dynamics of the interfaces' interaction with topography can modify many of the processes that generate mixing. Such sharp interfaces between water masses have been observed in several parts of the global ocean, but are unresolved and unrepresented in climate‐scale ocean models. We suggest that they are likely to play an important role in abyssal dynamics and mixing, and therefore require further exploration.",

While smaller than most active moons or planets, Ceres has many features commonly associated with active, icy bodies including: hydrothermal, cryovolcanic, and tectonic features. Yet on active icy moons tidal heating is a significant component of the thermal budget; it is unclear whether radiogenic heating alone would be sufficient to supply the heat necessary for Ceres' interior to undergo solid‐state convection. Here we show that transient asymmetric convection develops as the temperature within the body rises from heat generated by the decay of long‐lived radionuclides (e.g., U, Th, K). The onset of transient asymmetric convection may reconcile a number of puzzling features on Ceres including: the missing large craters, Hanami Planum—the region of thickened crust, the gravity and crustal thickness, and the lithospheric stress state represented by the Samhain Catenae. Hemispheric‐scale instabilities may also be important in the evolution of small bodies with small cores throughout the solar system, including the small icy moons of Saturn and Uranus as well as Kuiper belt objects.",

    "abstract": "Climate change affects the terrestrial carbon cycle through many pathways. In particular, CO2 fertilization can shape tree growth, death, and tolerance or resilience to climate change (Walker et al., 2021). Titrating the role of the different influences of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) on the carbon cycle through forest ecology has encouraged large experiments (Free-Air CO2 Enrichment [FACE] experiments), analyses of dendrochronological and inventory data sets (Brienen et al., 2020), and vegetation model simulations to identify and quantify potential effects at different scales (Needham et al., 2020). In this issue, Marquès et al. (2023) tackle a potentially critical yet empirically challenging indirect consequence of eCO2 fertilization: although faster growth in response to eCO2 might accelerate carbon fixation, this acceleration could be offset by an increase in large tree mortality. Termed the Grow Fast-Die Young hypothesis (GFDY), this reflects a role of tree size thresholds associated with increased mortality, or “size-driven senescence” in shaping the population-wide consequences of accelerated tree growth. GFDY requires that size, and not age, is the primary determinant of the mortality of mature trees. Were senescence (late-life increase in mortality) due solely to age, growing fast would be decoupled from dying young, and any increase in life-time productivity would lead to a direct increase in forest biomass. This would offset atmospheric CO2 concentration increases as the fertilization effect of eCO2 would lead to a larger terrestrial carbon sink. Although certainly age plays a role in tree mortality (e.g., the advance of pathogens, damage accrued over life) the types of processes that lead to animal death due to age (telomere shortening, mutation accumulation, etc.) appear not to be prevalent in the meristems or distal tissues and organs of even very old trees (Klimešová et al., 2015; Mencuccini et al., 2005; Thomas, 2013); but see (Cannon et al., 2022). Size-based tree senescence supports the premise that the GFDY would subtract from any potential sink gained from eCO2 growth stimulation. This raises critical questions: how quickly and how universally might the GFDY operate? Any potential GFDY responses will be entangled with other trends in climate change, and complex physiological and ecological tradeoffs from the scale of the cell to the community. This complicates distinguishing the signal from noise. Marquès et al. (2023), recognizing that multiple mechanisms contribute to stand-level growth, conceived an elegant way of testing hypotheses about the eCO2 effect, acknowledging contingencies of stand dynamics, and identifying key sensitivities that determine stand responses to eCO2. They use forest inventory data and simulations to demonstrate potential and observed changes in the stand thinning line (STL, Marques et al., 2023 Figure 1a). STL is a line fit to the upper boundary of the relationship between stand-level biomass and stem number--a relationship that, within a stand, describes the distribution of biomass distributed across stems (Figure 1a). Stand development in phase space (a) and over time (b). Stand phase space (a) shows how forest stands develop following disturbance in a plot of biomass versus stem number (green line), with disturbance resetting the stand (dashed green line). The maximum biomass for a stand of a given stem density (black line) is the self thinning line (STL). Increases in STL as shown in Marquès et al. are marked by a shift (red arrows) to a new STL (red dashed line). The same conceptual relationships are shown across a stand development timeline in (b) (adapted from McMahon et al. (2010)). As the stand develops over time, biomass increases, with reduced stem density implicit in this process. Equivalent to (a), however, is that biomass has a maximum amount for stands of any given age (black solid line), and an increase in biomass across stands would result in a new biomass line (red dashed line). Both Marquès et al. and McMahon et al. (2010) found an increasing amount of biomass across these different conceptual charts of stand development. McMahon et al. (2010) used repeated recent censuses of stands of different ages (a chronosequence [connected lines in different colors]) and showed that the recent growth of these stands did not reflect the implied trajectory of their biomass development (black line), but instead showed increased recent growth (red arrows). A strength of using the STL to identify GFDY effects is that it emerges from a simple bivariate distribution easily acquired from inventory data that captures whole-forest dynamics. Essentially, an increase in the intercept of the STL indicates an increase in carbon carrying capacity in the stand across size-classes (i.e., if the STL shifts up, all stems are larger). By applying this analysis only to data from mature, undisturbed forests of similar composition over time, Marquès et al. were able to account for many of the confounding factors in GFDY analyses. A similar pattern was also found in McMahon et al., 2010 (Figure 1b). Both observational data analyses and simulations demonstrated that eCO2 may not be completely offset by earlier mortality and that some forests have been gaining biomass even as mortality has increased due to the GFDY. They qualify some early work that found a complete offset of fertilization response (Brienen et al., 2020; Bugmann & Bigler, 2010), and support model analyses that also found incomplete offset (Needham et al., 2020). More importantly, the Marquès et al. finding advances the discussion as it indicates that the critical determinant of the strength of the GFDY (or its existence at all), and therefore the extent to which eCO2 might lead to a change in the carbon sink, is through the shape of the curve relating size to mortality (Figure 1a). This advances the eCO2 discussion from the physiology of growth to the relative importance of mechanisms of size-based senescence. Research into the GFDY impacts on the carbon cycle requires we better understand the mechanisms of tree senescence, essentially asking: how do mature individuals die as a function of size? Three categories of mortality processes may help organize efforts to answer this question: (a) large size can leave an individual more vulnerable to exogenous mortality agents, such as wind damage or hydraulic failure, or the high ratio of maintenance costs to crown area (McDowell et al., 2018); (b) an interaction between genetic programs and exogenous factors may accelerate death at maturity through the reallocation of resources that maintain vigor to reproductive organs at the expense of maintenance (Thomas, 2013); and (c) an extension of 2, where genetic programs triggered at a size threshold lead to internal shifts in function that lead to death, such as is observed in monocarpic trees that die when flowering (Batalova & Krutovsky, 2023; Read et al., 2021; Thomas, 2013). We know these categories to be non-mutually exclusive and the processes to be complex. How we better identify the ways in which these mechanisms shape the mortality curves of species globally requires continued collections of inventory data, experiments, and simulations. In order to properly scale observations, the use of remote sensing technologies such as lidar and hyperspectral imaging might improve observations of canopy stress and structural damage (a) from flowering patterns and canopy function (b). Gene expression data and better annotated genomes, especially of important tropical species which are poorly represented in gene databases, would also better identify internal mechanisms of stress response and senescence pathways (1, 2, and 3). The exploration of tree senescence marks not only a fascinating area of interdisciplinary research in understanding eCO2 and climate change influences on tree performance, but also one critical to our better understanding and predicting the future of the Earth System. The authors declare no conflicts of interest relevant to this study. Data were not used, nor created for this research.",

Taking advantage of the modulation of free tropospheric relative humidity by vertical motions, we derive analytical relationships that allow us to retrieve vertical motions in clear air from geostationary measurements of brightness temperature in the infrared absorption band of water vapor. The new observations have a resolution of 1 hr and 2 km in time and space, respectively. They capture the variability of mesoscale and large‐scale vertical velocity measured during field campaigns. In the mid‐troposphere, clear‐sky vertical motions are mostly subsiding but highly heterogeneous in space and time. Around organized deep convective systems, strong subsidence (&gt;500 hPa·day −1 ) is observed within a distance of a few hundred kilometers. In contrast, transient upward motions of up to 100 hPa·day −1 can occur at the mesoscale. Vertical motions in the clear‐sky atmosphere appear to be primarily associated with buoyancy and gravity waves at the mesoscale, and with radiative cooling and equatorial waves at larger spatial scales. This new retrieval reveals a rich range of dynamical features that were previously invisible, thus shedding new light on tropical meteorology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Because of its global abundance and reactivity with hydroxyl radicals (OH•), tropospheric carbon monoxide indirectly impacts the lifetimes of other OH•‐reactive gases, in particular methane and reactive hydrocarbons. The origin and chemistry of atmospheric CO have been studied using stable isotopes. Both 13 CO and C 18 O undergo isotopic fractionation during its main chemical loss reaction, CO + OH•. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for 13 CO is mass dependent, with a value of ∼5‰; 12 CO reacts faster than 13 CO with OH. Whereas C 18 O + OH• exhibits an inversely mass dependent KIE ∼−10‰. We hypothesize these KIEs result in a relative depletion of 13 C 18 O, a CO clumped isotope. To test this, we collected CO from air samples on Long Island, NY, and discovered a −3 to −8‰ difference in the clumped isotope ratio, Δ 31 , relative to a random distribution of 13 C and 18 O in CO. A clear negative trend between [CO] and Δ 31 is driven by two factors: (a) the atmospheric addition of CO from either a primary or secondary source with a Δ 31 of ∼0‰ and (b) the continuing reaction of CO with OH•, leaving the remaining CO pool relatively depleted in 13 C 18 O. This is analogous to the mechanism that determines CO Δ 17 O values. This study is among the first to show clumped isotope fractionation resulting from atmospheric chemistry and not thermal equilibration, which may inform the identification of clumped isotope KIEs in other atmospheric trace gases. These first Δ 31 observations motivate future experimental and observational studies targeted at characterizing the clumped isotopes of CO sources, background CO, and experimentally fractionated CO.",

A large population of 0–165 Ma old zircons have coherent oxygen (δ 18 O 3.8–5.9‰) and hafnium (εHf (t) +3.5–+12.5) mantle isotopic signatures. These results are consistent with the crystallization of zircon from plume‐related melts. In addition, a chemically diverse population with ages from the Paleozoic to the Archean was found. These older populations are enigmatic but they could represent remnants of ancient subducted sediments. Meanwhile, the ∼0–165 Ma population is interpreted as plume‐derived, suggesting that the hotspot started at least ∼165 Ma ago. A spike of ∼164–160 Ma zircons could represent a Large Igneous Province (LIP) stage upon the first arrival of the plume. We use plate reconstructions to show that such a LIP would have formed on the Phoenix Plate and would have subducted below the Antarctic Peninsula around 100–105 Ma. There, LIP subduction would offer a solution for the enigmatic Palmer Land deformation event, previously proposed to result from a collision with an unknown indenter. The here‐reported “ghost” of a prolonged hotspot activity suggests that fragments of the Easter plume and of the ambient sub‐lithospheric mantle stored and re‐sampled zircon xenocrysts due to convective (re)circulation at the scale of the plume head. Our study demonstrates how zircon geochronology and geochemistry provide novel insights into global‐scale geodynamics, offering new perspectives on the dynamics of mantle plumes and hotspot activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we demonstrate that several ubiquitous hyporheic exchange mechanisms can be represented simply as a one‐dimensional diffusion process, where the diffusivity decays exponentially with depth into the streambed. Based on a meta‐analysis of 106 previously published laboratory measurements of hyporheic exchange (capturing a range of bed morphologies, hydraulic conditions, streambed properties, and experimental approaches) we find that the reference diffusivity and mixing length‐scale are functions of the permeability Reynolds Number and Schmidt Number. These dimensionless numbers, in turn, can be estimated for a particular stream from the median grain size of the streambed and the stream's depth, slope, and temperature. Application of these results to a seminal study of nitrate removal in 72 headwater streams across the United States, reveals: (a) streams draining urban and agricultural landscapes have a diminished capacity for in‐stream and in‐bed mixing along with smaller subsurface storage zones compared to streams draining reference landscapes; (b) under steady‐state conditions nitrate uptake in the streambed is primarily biologically controlled; and (c) median reaction timescales for nitrate removal in the hyporheic zone are 0.5 and 20 hr for uptake by assimilation and denitrification, respectively. While further research is needed, the simplicity and extensibility of the framework described here should facilitate cross‐disciplinary discussions and inform reach‐scale studies of pollutant fate and transport and their scale‐up to watersheds and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cities in warmer climate zones have experienced extreme heat and unbearable drought conditions due to climate change. Developing a practical and integrated framework to tackle the trade‐off between land surface temperature (LST) reduction and water conservation is essential for heat mitigation and resilience planning. We developed a multi‐objective framework of spatial optimization for priority areas that considers environmental justice. We identified the priority areas (i.e., residential districts, socio‐economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, hotspot regions, and opportunity areas) using ECOSTRESS‐based LST, actual evapotranspiration (ETa, as a proxy to outdoor water use [OWU]), Landsat‐based LST and ETa changes (2000–2020), and the evaporative stress index. The configuration of vegetation was spatially optimized to achieve the highest co‐benefits by equally balancing both objectives. We found that LST decreased and OWU increased as the vegetation percentage rose from 25% to 45%. The trade‐off between heat reduction and water conservation indicates that LST is not significantly reduced, as OWU reaches above the mid‐level if we focus mainly on LST reduction. The associated green space configurations suggest that grass coverage gradually increases as tree coverage decreases slightly in unmanaged soil. Overall, hotspot regions have a higher potential to lower LST by consuming less water than other areas with the same percentage of new vegetation. Based on this perspective, we suggest that urban planners and city managers prioritize hotspot regions by considering environmental justice and co‐benefits to ensure highly efficient LST amelioration and OWU conservation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Jupiter's atmosphere comprises several dynamical regimes: the equatorial eastward flows and surrounding retrograde jets; the midlatitudes, with the eddy‐driven, alternating jet‐streams and meridional circulation cells; and the jet‐free turbulent polar region. Despite intensive research conducted on each of these dynamical regimes over the past decades, they remain only partially understood. Saturn's atmosphere also encompasses similar distinguishable regimes, but observational evidence for midlatitude deep meridional cells is lacking. Models offer a variety of explanations for each of these regions, but only a few are capable of simulating more than one of the regimes at once. This study presents new numerical simulations using a 3D deep anelastic model that can reproduce the equatorial flows as well as the midlatitudinal pattern of the mostly barotropic, alternating eddy‐driven jets and the meridional circulation cells accompanying them. These simulations are consistent with recent Juno mission gravity and microwave data. We find that the vertical eddy momentum fluxes are as important as the meridional eddy momentum fluxes, which drive the midlatitudinal circulation on Earth. In addition, we discuss the parameters controlling the number of midlatitudinal jets/cells, their extent, strength, and location. We identify the strong relationship between meridional circulation and the zonal jets in a deep convection setup, and analyze the mechanism responsible for their generation and maintenance. The analysis presented here provides another step in the ongoing pursuit of understanding the deep atmospheres of gas giants.",

The results suggest that the mechanism responsible for the optical emission might involve a point‐like source of superthermal electrons energized locally, which can excite the atomic oxygen.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rivers around the world have been heavily engineered, and these man‐made changes are affecting important biogeochemical cycles. Rivers play a key role in the global carbon cycle, by mobilizing organic carbon from land and delivering it to the oceans. River engineering techniques, like levees that prevent flooding, change the way carbon is cycled through rivers, but it is difficult to identify and quantify these changes. Shen et al. (2021) were able to quantify changes in river organic carbon fluxes induced by bank stabilization in the Mississippi River. The authors compared the age distribution of organic carbon in modern river sediment and old river sediment deposited before the construction of extensive levee systems. They found that bank stabilization significantly reduces the amount of time organic carbon spends in the river system before being exported to the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, less organic carbon is oxidized to CO 2 and more organic carbon is exported to the ocean, ultimately reducing atmospheric CO 2 . This study highlights an important effect of anthropogenic activity on river carbon fluxes that should be considered in global carbon cycle models.",

    "abstract": "The interior of the Earth at depths greater than about 70 km is entirely devoid of earthquakes, except for a few limited regions associated with current or recent subduction. The absence of earthquakes is expected, since friction along faults becomes too great for brittle failure at these pressures. The difficult question, which has been debated for decades, is what physical process allows deep earthquakes to occur in subduction environments. Now, in a recent publication in AGU Advances, Shirey et al. (2021) provide strong evidence that fluids exist in deep subduction environments, and play a crucial role in producing deep earthquakes. It is generally accepted that at least some earthquakes at intermediate depths (70–300 km) result from the dehydration of minerals in the subducting slab. This is indicated by the occurrence of upper zone earthquakes of double seismic zones in the subducting crust at pressure and temperature conditions where hydrous minerals dehydrate (Hacker et al., 2003). High fluid pressures from dehydration reactions will reduce normal stresses and thus friction along faults and allow fault motion to occur. Alternatively, dehydration reactions may produce weak nanocrystalline reaction products and transfer stress to the surrounding rock, allowing shear failure (Ferrand et al., 2017). Despite this evidence that intermediate depth earthquakes are linked to dehydration reactions, the connection between fluids and deep seismicity (depths 300–690 km) have been poorly understood and little explored. Mechanisms for deep earthquakes are often ascribed to phase transformations that produce seismicity through stresses induced by volume decrease and the creation of weak nanocrystalline reaction products. Experimental evidence shows that shear failure can be created by rapid non-equilibrium phase transformations from metastable olivine to wadsleyite or ringwoodite. These transformations are thought to occur in a metastable olivine wedge in the cold slab core if the reactions are kinetically inhibited (Green & Houston, 1995; Kirby et al., 1996). However, the existence of metastable olivine wedges is uncertain, and the fault dimensions of large deep earthquakes are larger than can be accommodated in a metastable wedge (Wiens, 2001). Alternatively, another widely cited model for deep earthquakes is shear heating and thermal runaway, where slip along a shear zone generates heat which reduces viscosity promoting faster movement (Ogawa, 1987). In some versions, a thin melt layer forms along the fault zone, further reducing resistance. It is possible that large deep earthquakes are triggered in the slab core by transformational faulting, and propagate into the outer regions of the slab by runaway shear instabilities (McGuire et al., 1997; Zhan, 2020). The lack of interest in devolatilization and fluids as a mechanism for deep earthquakes has largely been due to the lack of definitive evidence for fluids associated with deep slabs. In addition, there are uncertainties about the transport mechanism for volatiles to transition zone depths, as well as questions about whether mantle minerals actually devolatilize in the transition zone. However, Shirey et al. (2021) now bring together evidence from diamond inclusions and thermal models to show that fluids are present in the transition zone near subduction zones and represent a viable mechanism for deep earthquakes. Shirey et al. (2021) present evidence from diamond inclusions that has been accumulating over the past few years showing that subduction zone fluids occur in the transition zone. Mineral barometry indicates that almost all majorite garnet diamond inclusions formed in the transition zone, and hydrous ringwoodite has been found in a diamond inclusion, conclusively demonstrating a transition zone origin (Pearson et al., 2014). The diamonds show growth textures and layers that indicate formation by crystallization from fluids rather than transformation from graphite. The diamond and inclusion compositions also provide evidence for the origin of the diamond-forming fluids. The fluids forming sublithospheric carbonatitic diamonds have affinity with carbonated oceanic crust, suggesting a formation from altered oceanic crust. In contrast, fluids forming aqueous sublithospheric diamonds are geochemically similar to serpentinized oceanic upper mantle. The diamond results demonstrate that free hydrous and carbonatitic fluids occur in or near subducting slabs at transition zone depths, adding important information to the debate over the mechanism of deep earthquakes. Shirey et al. (2021) then use thermal models to predict the transport of volatiles to the transition zone in slabs. These calculations use finite element flow models incorporating temperature and stress-dependent rheologies to predict the pressure and temperature paths of subducting slab material for a variety of subduction zones. The results show that for colder subducting slabs, antigorite and chlorite in mantle peridotite will transfer water to a series of dense hydrous magnesium silicate phases (10 angstrom phase, phase A, phase E, and phase D), thus delivering water to the transition zone. In contrast, slabs that are warmer due to slow subduction of young lithosphere fully dehydrate at depths of 100–250 km. Slabs with deep earthquakes retain water to transition zone depths, whereas slabs without deep earthquakes are predicted to dehydrate at intermediate depths. Thus, thermal modeling suggests the delivery of hydrous minerals to the transition zone may be a necessary condition for deep earthquakes. Examination of phase relationships for carbonate-bearing altered ocean crust suggests that carbonate will also be retained in old, cold subduction zones to transition zone depths, where it will form carbonated melt. These developments show that fluids exist in the transition zone in the vicinity of subducting slabs, making fluid-assisted faulting a viable explanation for the mechanism of deep earthquakes. Thermal models showing that volatiles are delivered to the transition zone in cold slabs with deep earthquakes but escape at shallower depths in warmer slabs lacking deep earthquakes provide important evidence. However, several difficulties remain. Since slab temperature controls many factors related to possible faulting mechanisms, similar arguments about the occurrence of deep earthquakes in warm and cold slabs have been made for other deep earthquake mechanisms (e.g. Kirby et al, 1996). An additional difficulty with fluid-assisted faulting is that dense hydrous magnesium silicates dehydrate at temperatures significantly greater than those expected in the transition zone portion of cold slabs. Shirey et al. (2021) suggest that slabs may stagnate in the transition zone until they become warm enough to dehydrate and liberate fluids. However, deep earthquakes are primarily observed in the cold core of continuous slabs extending through the transition zone, not in stagnated slabs. This requires fluid transport to the seismically active region, and eliminates faulting mechanisms linked to weak reaction products and stress transfer produced by the dehydration reaction itself. Further observational, laboratory, and modeling work will be needed to fully understand the relationship between slab volatiles, fluids, and deep earthquakes.",

    "abstract": "Geoscientists are studying some of the most pressing problems for humanity today—from earthquake prediction to sustainable energy resources to the quality of air we breathe to climate change and sea level rise. The lack of a geosciences workforce that is representative of our society grossly limits our science and our ability to meet the challenges of sustaining our population on this planet. The representation of women in geosciences in the United States has markedly improved in the last several decades. And yet, women still remain underrepresented and underpaid compared to men in the science and engineering workforce (NCSES, 2021). The geosciences are cited as one of the least diverse fields in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics overall, and the gains seen in gender diversity are significant only for white women (Bernard & Cooperdock, 2018; Ranganathan et al., 2021). This has direct and damaging consequences for the current and future health of our nation and our economy. Ranganathan et al. (2021) is a timely update on the statistical makeup of faculty in the geosciences (Earth, ocean, atmospheric, and planetary sciences). While geoscience faculty are a very small percentage of the overall geoscience workforce in the United States, we have an outsized impact and influence on the undergraduate and graduate students who ultimately enter the workforce. Ranganathan et al. (2021) find that women currently represent up to ∼27% of all tenured and tenure-track faculty across 62 highly ranked geoscience programs (an increase from ∼20% reported in Glass, 2015). While many geoscience graduate programs are now seeing near parity in the (binary) gender makeup of their graduate programs, the loss of women from the academy following graduate school, and a gendered wage gap postgrad are still rampant. Ranganathan et al. quantify the disproportionate attrition of women at every stage from graduate school to postdoctoral positions to levels of the professoriate. They quantify this, cleverly, using a familiar geochemistry concept of the \"fractionation factor\" and detailing the statistics within fields in the Earth, ocean, atmospheric, and planetary sciences. At least two National Academy of Sciences reports document a suite of scholarly research, surveys, and testimonies that detail the bias, barriers, and hostile work climates that women scientists face as they attempt to succeed in their careers (NASEM, 2007, 2018). This is also concretely displayed in the recent film Picture a Scientist (https://www.pictureascientist.com/). Another recent National Academy of Sciences report (NASEM, 2020) also makes clear that we need to do much more than simply get more women and minoritized scholars into the \"leaky pipeline.\" This metaphor is a grossly inadequate representation of the obstacles minoritized scholars face in their efforts to succeed in a scientific career (Batchelor et al., 2021; Marín-Spiotta, 2018; Marín-Spiotta et al., 2020). Recent articles written by our own colleagues in the geosciences make clear that the path to a successful career in science, especially for BIPOC scientists, is a vicious obstacle course (e.g., Berhe, 2020; Chaudhary & Berhe, 2020; Dutt, 2020; Morris, 2021; Shepherd, 2020). We know a fair amount about the experiences of people who have succeeded in their science and in their careers despite these conditions; we know very little about the much larger percentage of people whose scientific careers were derailed by these conditions. So where do we go from here? As scientists, we constantly seek to improve our understanding; challenging our hypotheses with each new discovery to expand our thinking. We can and should do the same when it comes to our institutional structures and our cultural norms that perpetuate bias and barriers. We need to educate ourselves, not just about our science but also about how we can make becoming a scientist a possibility for anyone. We need to seek out and learn from different perspectives and bring that learning into practice within our structures, cultural norms, and hiring practices. As scientists, we critically review each other's work, interrogating data collection methods, and holding interpretations to high standards of reproducibility and understanding. Likewise, we should be open to interrogating our own biases, regularly, and demanding accountability of ourselves and our colleagues to treat people with as much respect as we treat data. In science, we seek to learn from our mistakes, improving technology, and knowledge capacity; and we need to critically examine the mistakes in the system, learn from them and evolve our culture. As a woman scientist, I was tenured at Brown by 44. In print, that picture of success does not speak of the obstacles I faced because of my gender. I navigated countless slights, losses of credit for ideas, unfair criticism of my work, harassment and so on. Much of my ability to overcome was the understanding I built through the community of women of the Earth Science Women's Network (ESWN). Today, ESWN is a nonprofit organization led by passionate women scientists who volunteer their time to increase diversity across the geosciences. There are many challenges in a scientific career that can result in success of a few at the expense of many equally talented scholars (NASEM, 2020). ESWN empowers early career scientists through professional development by creating a nurturing, trusting community to support women, in their professional and personal lives. And we created initiatives working for cultural change to eliminate barriers to a more diverse scientific workforce (https://eswnonline.org/; https://geosciencewomen.org/; https://serc.carleton.edu/advancegeo/index.html). In my own career, I have learned to recognize that not all norms in our community are rules. I have navigated the institutional structures we have in place, and carved out a path that works for me. I have benefited from policies enacted in the last several decades to improve our workplaces for (white) women; and I have benefited from support within the departments that I have worked. To also thrive and not just survive, I had the support of a community of women that inspired and gave me courage when I needed it, making it possible for me to navigate breast cancer as a postdoc and have two children pre-tenure. Making our community a better place for everyone to be will make our science and our scientific enterprise better, and I ask that you join me in these efforts.",

Elite and highly ranked Geoscience programs have a duty to use these benefits to lead on equity. Unfortunately, they too are starkly underrepresented in faculty and scientists from historically excluded communities. A lack of scientists from historically excluded groups, who can serve as role models potentially alienates, and disincentivizes marginalized students and scientists, and further hinders geoscience progress in diversity. Best ranked institutions can disrupt the cycle of underrepresentation by using their stature and visibility to serve as role models for diversity, equity, and inclusion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mesoscale convective systems (MCS) contribute about half of the world's precipitation and create flash flooding as well as other extreme weather events. Despite steady progress in research of these systems in the last several decades, better theoretical understanding is still needed to understand their dynamical organizations and to improve their forecasts in numerical models. By using the Moncrieff‐Green horizontal vorticity equation, this paper presents an analytical model of one type of MCS, the steady‐state squall lines. It describes the organization, propagation, and properties of mesoscale circulations of two‐dimensional steady‐state convective systems under sheared environment. Far‐side solutions are formulated to illustrate the underlying physical processes of squall line flows. Numerical procedures are described to solve the model under general environmental conditions. The model leads to the following prediction of squall line properties: Given the environmental profiles of wind and convective available potential energy (CAPE), the propagation speed, the depths and mass fluxes of the tilted ascending front‐to‐rear flow, the overturning updraft, and the descending rear inflow of the squall line can be all determined from the cold pool buoyancy or CAPE. The squall lines are therefore self‐organized dynamical systems that have limited degrees of freedom in their properties. The model advances the theoretical understanding of how mesoscale flow components interact to sustain organized convection. It provides a new tool to interpret squall line systems in high resolution models and to parameterize them in climate models.",

    "abstract": "One of the most significant recent advances in understanding Earth's structure, dynamics, and evolution has been the recognition of two Large Low S-wave Velocity Provinces, or LLSVPs, at the base of the mantle: one beneath Africa, the other beneath the South-Central Pacific. Each has an aerial extent of thousands of km2 and rise several hundreds of km above the core-mantle boundary. Their nature is unclear, but several lines of evidence suggest they are both hotter and denser than surrounding mantle (see review by McNamara, 2019). Importantly, most mantle plumes appear to be generated from these regions, particularly along the margins, while subduction appears to be focused on regions surrounding the LLSVPs. Mantle plumes come in a limited variety of enriched geochemical flavors derived from recycling of oceanic and continental crust into the mantle. In a new paper in AGU Advances, Jackson and Macdonald (2022) argue that the EMI and EMII mantle flavors result from deep subduction of ancient rifted passive margins during the assembly of Gondwana in the Neoproterozoic. Jackson and Mcdonald build their case on a number of observations. First, the oldest high pressure metamorphic belts are of Neoproterozoic age (Brown & Johnson, 2019), implying wholesale deep subduction of continental crust only began around that time (Condie, 2021). Second, EM plumes are rooted within or on the margins of the two LLSVPs in the southern hemisphere. Third, assembly of Gondwana occurred in the southern hemisphere in the Neoproterozoic. They argue that while sediment subduction and subduction erosion may have occurred throughout Earth's history, “sediments and the products of subduction erosion are not attached to a down-going slab, so they are buoyant and relaminate” to the base of continents (Hacker et al., 2011) rather than being carried into the deep mantle. They also argue that lower crust foundering can be ruled out as a source because lower continental crust does not have the appropriate isotopic composition to produce EM geochemical flavors. This provocative proposal ties into two vigorous debates about crust and mantle evolution. The first of these is the question of when did modern plate tectonics begin and how much continental crust has been destroyed through subduction and related processes through time? On the one hand, continental crust bears the geochemical fingerprint of subduction in relative depletions of elements such as Ta and Nb and enrichment in others such as Pb, suggesting modern style plate tectonics has persisted through much of Earth's history. On the other hand, most Archean terranes lack modern analogs and there are clear geochemical distinctions between Archean and post-Archean crust and magmatism. These, and other observations, have led some (e.g., Davaille et al., 2017) to argue that mantle convection in the early Earth was fundamentally different, lacking lateral lithospheric motion (“stagnant-lid tectonics”). At one extreme, Stern (2008) argued that modern-style plate tectonics only began in the Neoproterozoic (<1 Ga). At the other, Aarons et al. (2020) argue that modern style subduction began in the Archean. Many other estimates of when modern plate tectonics began fall somewhere in between. Despite the debate over when modern plate tectonics began, most recognize that substantial volumes of continental crust have been lost since the early Archean. Thus Jackson and Mcdonald's argument that continental material carried into the mantle by sediment subduction and subduction erosion is “relaminated” to the base of continents is a key part of their hypothesis. The relamination model (Hacker et al., 2011) is based on a variety of observations, most notably that metasediments are surprisingly abundant among lower crustal lithologies and that silica-rich material, including most sediments and upper crustal lithologies, will become buoyant when carried into the upper mantle. However, in the Hacker et al. (2011) model, only two-thirds of the crust-to-mantle flux is relaminated, with the remaining third continuing into the deep mantle, a flux of about 3 × 1012 Tg/yr. This is a substantial flux of continental material into the mantle, comprising, for example, ∼1/3 of the long-term average crustal growth rate of 9 × 1012 Tg/yr estimated by Dhuime et al. (2017), although substantially lower than some estimates of present crustal recycling rates. Furthermore, the relamination rate estimated by Hacker et al. (2011) is much greater than needed to account for the abundance of metasediments in lower crustal granulites. That said, even if crustal recycling has occurred throughout Earth's history and has thoroughly polluted the mantle, it is nonetheless possible that creation of the EMI and EMII reservoirs is a direct result of a specific tectonic event such as the assembly of Gondwana. Indeed, 87Sr/86Sr ratios in some Samoan lavas are well above typical continental crust values and so extreme (0.7126; Jackson et al., 2007) that they require very substantial amounts of continental material in their source. The second debate is over the evolution of the LLSVPs and whether their location controls plate tectonic processes, particularly assembly and breakup of supercontinents, or vice versa. Dziewonski et al. (2010) suggested that deep mantle structure “may have formed early in the history of the convecting mantle, remained locked in place with respect to the Earth's rotation axis ever since, and is currently imposing the planform of flow in the mantle and of plate tectonics at the surface.” Indeed, eruption of large igneous provinces and kimberlites appear also to have been associated with these features in their current locations over the last 300 Ma and perhaps the entire Phanerozoic (Torsvik et al., 2021). Variations in xenon and tungsten isotope ratios produced by extinct radionuclides 129I, 244Pu, and 182Hf indicate that some plumes sample material that has been largely isolated since very early in Earth history (Jackson et al., 2020; Mukhopadhyay & Parai, 2019), which favors the long-term persistence of LLSVPs. On the other hand, others, Li and Zhong (2009), for example, have argued that circum-supercontinent subduction leads to the formation of LLSVPs. Regardless of whether LLSVPs control mantle flow and the supercontinent cycle or vice versa, processes at the base of the mantle and at the Earth's surface are intimately connected (Torsvik et al., 2021). The Neoproterozoic was a time of great changes at the surface of the Earth. In addition to assembly of Gondwana, it is marked by extreme glaciations, a rise in atmospheric oxygen, and the first appearance of metazoans. If, as Jackson and Mcdonald propose, it also saw the initiation of deep crustal subduction and consequent formation of highly incompatible element enriched reservoirs within LLSVPs, then the Neoproterozoic Revolution would have encompassed the entire silicate portion of the Earth. At the least, Jackson and Mcdonald proposal should generate some quite interesting future debate. The authors declare no conflicts of interest relevant to this study.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, many global studies have shown plausible pathways for keeping global temperature increases below 1.5–2°C/2.7–3.6°F above preindustrial levels (IPCC, 2014b, 2018), above which scientists have been warning significant damages are highly likely (IPCC, 2014a, 2014b; U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2017, 2018). The +2°C and +1.5°C temperature goals roughly correspond with net-zero CO2 emissions and deep reductions in other greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 2070 and 2050, followed in the +1.5°C case by 5–20 GtC per year net-negative emissions for the foreseeable future. These global studies are not, however, sufficiently granular for national or regional infrastructure planning and policymaking, which is where the power for climate action lies. Williams et al. (2021) maps out eight regionally detailed scenarios for the United States to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions in time to hold global temperatures below 2°C (3.6F), 1.5°C (2.7F), and 1°C (1.8F) over preindustrial levels later this century if other countries make similar efforts; we currently stand at +1.1°C (2.0F). To the author's knowledge, this work is the first broad exploration of US scenarios compliant with the Paris Agreement that includes all energy-using sectors and natural land sinks since the US Mid-Century Strategy was submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in November 2016. The study also includes the first that returns to +1.0°C via a 500 Mt CO2 net negative land sink by 2050, a level of ambition beyond most discussion by undoing existing climate damages. Williams et al. (2021) directly address several key sectoral debates, especially the roles of variable wind and solar versus on-demand clean power options (e.g., geothermal, hydrogen turbines, nuclear, or fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage [CCS]), and human-made versus agricultural and land use sinks. While not the end of the story, this project provides a firm foundation for establishing state and federal stakeholder dialogue and adaptive policy moving forward. There is wide agreement on the key strategies for deep decarbonization: (1) demand but not necessarily end-use service reductions (e.g., reduced home heating needs through efficiency and electric heat pumps), (2) decarbonization of the end-use electricity, liquid and gaseous fuels, and feedstocks used by households and firms, and (3) the use of land-use and human-made negative emissions measures, including biomass combustion or direct air CO2 capture (Keith et al., 2018) followed by CCS, to directly return CO2 to the geosphere (Baker et al., 2020; Bataille et al., 2016; Clarke et al., 2014; Grubler et al., 2018; Van Vuuren et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2012). What is newly done by Williams et al. (2021) is the systematic modeling of eight different but related scenarios, specifically for the United States, at a sufficient level of state detail to begin infrastructure planning and sectoral policymaking. These include a least cost pathway, low fossil fuel and renewable cost variations, a low land for renewables variation, delayed electrification, lower overall demand, 100% renewable primary energy, and 500 Mt of net negative emissions to allow a return to +1.0°C. These scenarios address siloed literature debates and provide a systematic treatment of \"known unknowns\" through diverse scenarios, critical to building confidence for establishing robust, adaptive policy (Waisman et al., 2019). In particular, the authors address the role of variable renewable generation and clean firm power to temporally match electricity demand and supply via multiple scenarios. They find 100% renewables with hydrogen firm power backup is possible, but it is not the least expensive option and needs more land. In the least cost option, firm clean power is provided by hydropower, remaining nuclear units, and fossil methane turbines running infrequently, with their emissions absorbed by biorefineries with CCS and long-lived chemical feedstock sinks. The recent dramatic and continuing fall in the cost of wind and solar photovoltaics, often below the running cost of coal and natural gas plants, means variable renewables provide 80% or more of primary energy in all the scenarios described, and even 90% in the least cost scenario. Industry may bear further exploration, as it still consumes significant amounts of fossil-fuel crude oil and methane in the least cost scenario, and expensively but renewably sourced biomass liquid fuels and gases in the 100% renewable scenario; it's mainly business-as-usual with cleaner feedstocks and CCS. Since the Paris Agreement, which pushed the global target for this century from a maximum −80% reduction to net-zero & negative, transformational technical if not yet commercial means have been established to reduce all industrial emissions to very low or negative levels. These include full thermal or electrocatalytic electrification, use of alternative low GHG heat sources (e.g., solar, biofuels, nuclear), use of hydrogen made via electrolysis or from methane with CCS, use of low carbon feedstocks, and direct CCS where appropriate. The methods used will depend on accelerated innovation and commercialization, regional clean energy resources and amenable CCS geology (Bataille, 2019; Bataille et al., 2018; Friedmann et al., 2019; Leeson et al., 2017; Rissman et al., 2020). Future national net-zero studies should ideally reflect this range of options. One of the intriguing findings, the relatively small costs of 0.2%–1.2% of GDP for reaching net-zero compared to the reference case, not including the benefits of avoided climate damages, suggests another line of inquiry. The authors use a 2% discount rate (which can be thought of as the interest rate paid for loans), a typical rate when valuing society-wide opportunity costs of capital and time. Most CO2 mitigation actions across the economy require more upfront capital but reduce fuel costs over the long term; a lower discount rate values the long-term benefits and costs more, and vice versa. Private, risk-adjusted rates of capital faced by firms and households when borrowing capital are typically at least several percent more than the social discount rate (Murphy & Jaccard, 2011). The upshot is while the net costs to society for reaching net-zero before accounting for reduced climate damages are likely low, from a firm and household perspective their relative individual costs will likely be higher, and this will reduce their incentive to act, e.g. for a household to replace their furnace with an electric heat pump. Given the long lifetimes of residences, buildings, infrastructure and industrial facilities, policymakers must address these challenges, and soon, if the net-zero targets are to be reached. More detailed economic and policy analyses, technically enriched by studies like this which provide a physical map to net-zero, are needed to address these questions. To help start this conversation, the paper's scenarios also serve as the quantitative foundation for America's Zero Carbon Action Plan, a climate policy road map for the new US administration and ambitious states, with contributions from influential American and international technical and policy specialists (https://www.unsdsn.org/Zero-Carbon-Action-Plan).

    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, citizen scientist photographs led to the discovery of a new auroral form called “the dune aurora” which exhibits parallel stripes of brighter emission in the green diffuse aurora at about 100 km altitude. This discovery raised several questions, such as (i) whether the dunes are associated with particle precipitation, (ii) whether their structure arises from spatial inhomogeneities in the precipitating fluxes or in the underlying neutral atmosphere, and (iii) whether they are the auroral manifestation of an atmospheric wave called a mesospheric bore. This study investigates a large‐scale dune aurora event on 20 January 2016 above Northern Europe. The dunes were observed from Finland to Scotland, spanning over 1,500 km for at least 4 h. Spacecraft observations indicate that the dunes are associated with particle precipitation and reveal the presence of a temperature inversion layer below the mesopause during the event, creating suitable conditions for mesospheric bore formation. The analysis of a time lapse of pictures by a citizen scientist from Scotland leads to the estimate that, during this event, the dunes propagate toward the west‐southwest direction at about 200 m s −1 , presumably indicating strong horizontal winds near the mesopause. These results show that citizen science and dune aurora studies can fill observational gaps and be powerful tools to investigate the least‐known region of near‐Earth space at altitudes near 100 km.",

    "abstract": "Ice shelves play an important role in controlling how fast ice moves off the Antarctic continent into the oceans, promoting sea-level rise. These floating bodies of ice effectively buttress the grounded ice behind them, hindering the flow of ice off land while also somewhat reducing the exposure of the grounding line to ocean melting (Gudmundsson, 2013). Their importance can perhaps be exemplified by comparing Antarctic ice streams terminating at ice shelves to Greenland's directly exposed calving fronts (Benn et al., 2017), where ice is currently being lost at a far greater rate (Oppenheimer et al., 2019). However, Antarctic ice shelves are vulnerable to rifting (Larour et al., 2021) and catastrophic breakup (Glasser & Scambos, 2008). Olinger et al. (2024) use seismology to shed new light on how such rifting can be limited by ocean coupling. Olinger et al. (2024) use observations combined with numerical modeling to highlight how vulnerable ice shelves can be to rifting, and in particular how the ocean can play a role in setting rifting velocity (see Figure 1). This work is particularly exciting for two reasons. First, they combine satellite and seismic observations with a numerical model, to not only understand but also quantify the rifting process. Second, they find that coupling of the ice shelf rift with the ocean actually limits the rate of rift propagation. This is contrary to the majority of ice shelf-ocean interactions, which generally act to exacerbate ice shelf instability (e.g., Holland et al. (2008)). Schematic diagram, adapted from Figure 2 of Olinger et al. (2024), summarizing the findings of that work. Satellite observations are one of the most effective means of observing ice shelf rifting. Olinger et al. (2024) use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to map changes in the rift extent at Pine Island Glacier (PIG) ice shelf, before and after a major rifting event. However, one of the greatest challenges posed by such remote sensing data is the poor temporal sampling (Baumhoer et al., 2018). This is evident in the data used by Olinger et al. (2024), where they analyze images six days apart, only capturing the rift extent prior to and post the major rifting episode. During this time, they find that the rift lengthens by 10.5 km. Capturing higher resolution temporal behavior of the rift is critical for understanding rifting in more detail. Olinger et al. (2024) use seismic observations from instruments deployed on the ice shelf to provide continuous temporal sampling of the rift. They searched through the continuous data to identify the dominant rifting event, which they assume accommodated the majority of rifting observed in the satellite data. From this rifting event, they observe an increase in seismic energy from surface waves of 300 s duration, which allows them to quantify a rifting velocity of 35 m s−1. Although this velocity may appear fast from a glaciology perspective, theory suggests that fractures of pure ice exhibiting brittle fracturing should propagate near the Rayleigh wave speed (Freund, 1990), ∼1,500 m s−1 (Roethlisberger, 1972). To address the considerable difference in observed versus theoretical rift propagation velocity, Olinger et al. (2024) turn to numerical modeling. Combining observations with models is inherently challenging, yet can provide important new insights into physical processes. The authors exemplify this in their work. They present a simplified ocean-coupled fracture model based on coupling the conservation of fluid momentum with linear elastic fracture mechanics. The key take-home message from the authors' work is that water entrained into the rift acts to oppose rift opening, which limits the rift opening rate. Their result demonstrates the insight that a simple model can provide: in this case an explanation for the seismically-observed rift opening rate, at least to first order. While the results of Olinger et al. (2024) are exciting in themselves, the work also raises some questions about future research directions. One limitation of their work is that they assume that most of the rifting is confined to one seismic episode. However, in many cases, especially where there might be many suture zones, rifts may propagate via many short episodes rather than one long episode. Satellite data are currently blind to this. The authors show the value of seismic observations in quantifying the rift process, and it would be feasible going forward to search for many smaller rifting episodes in a similar data set. It is also possible that some rifting is accommodated aseismically and that the seismic efficiency of rifting may be significantly less than 1. In that case, seismic data alone might not provide a sufficient picture of the process. One further thought is that ice shelves can vary considerably, especially regarding basal topography and cavity depth. Going forward, it would be interesting to understand how consistent the behavior observed by Olinger et al. (2024) is for other ice shelves. In summary, Olinger et al. (2024) show how high temporal sampling of rift dynamics combined with simple numerical modeling can shed light on a fundamental process. Their intriguing result demonstrates that hydrodynamical coupling of the ocean with the ice rift actually acts to limit rift propagation rates. Whereas most ocean-ice interactions tend to promote ice shelf damage, this is an example of how fluid interactions can enhance ice shelf stability, or at least slow the processes that promote collapse. The authors' work shows promise for using remote sensing and seismic data in combination with models to better understand rifting, a critical process that influences the stability of ice shelves.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mid‐ocean ridges generate basalt and harzburgite, which are introduced into the mantle through subduction as a mechanical mixture, contributing to both lateral and radial compositional heterogeneity. The possible accumulation of basalt in the mantle transition zone has been examined, but details of the mantle composition below the 660‐km discontinuity (hereafter d660) remain poorly constrained. In this study, we utilize the subtle waveform details of S660S , the underside shear‐wave reflection off the d660, to interpret the seismic velocity, density, and compositional structure near, and particularly below, the d660. We identify a significant difference in S660S waveform shape in subduction zones compared to other regions. The inversion results reveal globally enriched basalt at the d660, with a notably higher content in subduction zones, consistent with the smaller impedance jump and S660S peak amplitude. The basalt fraction decreases significantly to less than 10% near 800‐km depth, forming a global harzburgite‐enriched layer and resulting in a steep seismic velocity gradient just below the d660, in agreement with 1D global reference models. The striking compositional radial variations near the d660 verify geodynamic predictions and challenge the applicability of homogeneous radial compositional models in the mantle. These variations may also affect the viscosity profile and, consequently, the dynamics at the boundary between the upper and lower mantle.",

We generate the first meridional profiles of Mars' REB at seasonal and annual timescales through measurements based on long term multi‐instrument observations from spacecraft orbiting Mars. Then, we compare our findings to Earth's REB using contemporary satellite data sets. Each planet exhibits remarkably distinct seasonal REB distributions due to differences in their orbital, atmospheric, and surface properties. Annually, Earth's REB exhibits a tropical energy surplus and a deficit at the poles. In contrast, Mars' annual REB displays an inverted meridional distribution with significant hemispheric asymmetry. Additionally, global dust storms significantly modify the Martian REB. Our observations are employable in future studies to improve models on Mars' general circulation, meteorology, and polar ice cap evolution.",

Previous views of this event have mainly come from places well away from Ground Zero, where we see the extinction of ~70% of life, the fallout of a globe‐spanning ejecta cloud, and the slumps and tsunamis that accompanied one of the biggest terrestrial earthquakes ever. The new view from the crater in a drill core records the collapse of the shattered and melted crater walls, the flood of the ocean back into the submarine crater, and the formation of hot vents over the pool of melt rock. The record shows that decades to centuries after the impact, the calm tropical marine lake was taken over by red tides and animals that colonized the previously sterile crater floor. The exact timing of appearance of the first newly evolved species is hard to pin down but probably occurred within a few centuries to several millennia based on evidence from the intensity of burrowing and estimates of sedimentation rates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere is regulated by stomata (small pores in the leaves of plants). Unsurprisingly, environmental factors controlling the opening and closure of stomata has been sought as early as 1800. One approach, popularized in the early 1970s, is a stomatal optimization framework. This framework is based on the hypothesis that plants optimize carbon gain subject to water loss or water availability constraints. This constraint optimization problem was solved in various forms assuming instantaneous adjustments of stomatal aperture to maximize a reward function with no future foresight or legacy effects. Holtzman et al. (2024, https://doi.org/10.1029/2023av001113 ) offers a novel approach that can diagnose the effective timescale over which the reward function maximization must be time‐integrated. The developed method thus optimizes an integrated carbon gain function but adjusted by a discount factor subject to water availability in the root zone. The discount factor considers how the plant values carbon gain to save water and its timescale can be inferred from observations because the model is analytically tractable. The results suggest that the most important climate factor that determines this discount timescale is multi‐annual mean of the longest dry period during the growing season. The findings highlight how local climate traits influence the spatial variation in ecosystem‐level water use strategies. This sets the stage for expanding such a framework to cases where multiple constraints act in concert while operating at distinct time scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract I investigate the detectability of magma reservoirs in the vertical gravity gradient (VGG) anomalies calculated from satellite altimetry data. First, I calculate a suite of synthetic seamount models to show the expected VGG anomaly characteristic wavelength and amplitude for a simplified magmatic system, hydrothermal system, and a caldera infill, varying their dimensions for a given depth and density contrast. I find that most magmatic and hydrothermal systems create VGG anomalies with a characteristic wavelength and amplitude greater than the data uncertainty and are therefore detectable. The proposed approach consists in three main steps: (a) calculate the VGG from the two components of the deflection of the vertical, (b) calculate and remove the gravity contribution of the bathymetry interface using an independent bathymetry data set (e.g., acquired by multibeam echosounders) to obtain a VGG Bouguer gravity anomaly, (c) invert the Bouguer VGG anomaly to obtain a 3D density model. I image a 6‐by‐8‐km low density body between 3 and 9 km depth under Brothers volcano in the Kermadec arc. I hypothesize that it represents the main magmatic system, possibly with a minor fraction of hydrothermal fluids at the shallower depths. There are about 225 submarine volcanoes globally that could be studied with satellite altimetry‐derived gravity data to potentially image their magmatic system. Future altimetry data will increase the gravity data resolution and allow us to image smaller features. This is thus an invaluable data set for the study of underexplored submarine volcanoes and can help improve our volcano hazards assessment.",

While acknowledging the high value of Chang et al.’s analysis, this commentary argues that the way its results are emphasized and discussed matters. As it is, the proposed narrative might even inadvertently (not intentionally) contribute to a “climate delay discourse,” that is, a discourse that fully accepts climate change but justifies inadequate efforts. From a climate emergency perspective, one important result of the study is that total emissions have increased substantially in the last two decades, at odds with climate change mitigation targets. A more transformative narrative would highlight the need to cultivate synergies between production and more ambitious demand‐side efforts, rather than the differences between their respective mitigation potentials.",

    "abstract": "Earth's earliest epochs are shrouded by billions of years of planetary and biological evolution. As a result, many questions surround the origins of life, ranging from what surface conditions prevailed to where and how key prebiotic precursors formed and combined to give rise to life as we know it. Stanley Miller and Harold Urey performed some of the first laboratory explorations of those questions with their spark discharge experiments (Miller, 1953, 1955; Miller & Urey, 1959). Six decades on, researchers are describing plausible mechanisms that can form the building blocks of life (e.g., Becker et al., 2019) from molecules anticipated to exist in a prebiotic atmosphere (Cleaves et al., 2008) and ocean (Rimmer & Shorttle, 2019). These advances are all important components of the long voyage toward discovering how life originated on Earth. And while the ultimate destination is set, the route is not fully mapped, nor has the ship been fully assembled. Part of that missing map is due to the limits in our understanding of sulfur, as is discussed by Ranjan et al. Sulfur is thought to play critical roles in prebiotic chemistry, volatile cycling, and climate in large part due to its ability to gain and lose electrons and participate in chemistry as a gas, dissolved in liquids, or as a solid. Sulfur aerosols, formed from either sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or elemental sulfur (Sn), contribute to the present-day climates of both Venus (e.g., Taylor & Grinspoon, 2009) and Earth (e.g., Storelvmo et al., 2016), and substantial hazes may have appeared at multiple points in Earth's (e.g., Kasting et al., 1989) and Mars' (e.g., Tian et al., 2010) histories. The work of Ranjan et al. helps to draw a more complete map and furnishing a seaworthy vessel in three ways. First, their efforts are advancing our understanding of the earliest part of Earth's history. Because of the potential effect sulfate and elemental sulfur have on the climate of the early Earth, as well as the secondary effect that those species have on other sulfur-bearing molecules in the atmosphere (e.g., Kasting et al., 1989), understanding how sulfite reacts is an important region of the molecular map. Sulfate is also critical in several proposed pathways to form prebiotic molecules (e.g., Becker et al., 2019), making it a vital component of the vessel traversing the abiotic to biotic seascape. Second, the experiments described are neither quick nor easy to perform, which matters when many of the remaining problems are difficult to accomplish on \"graduate student lifetime\" timescales. Of all the atoms that stock the prebiotic shipyard, including carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur, sulfur is perhaps the thorniest. Given its moderate electronegativity, sulfur can (and does) form numerous distinct molecules with other species, but this is also a double-edged sword. Sulfur compounds tend to be more reactive and unstable, posing hazards to lab personnel and equipment (e.g., Raab & Feldmann, 2019). Additionally, much like carbon, sulfur can form numerous allotropes, but molecular sulfur species are notorious for clogging instrumentation and gumming up experiments. All these effects together mean that sulfur reactions are some of the most poorly constrained (if at all), and given sulfur's chemical flexibility, that's a large fraction of the prebiotic chemical toolbox that is inaccessible or unknown. The experiments of Ranjan et al. in particular probe slow reactions, which are competing with other processes that are orders of magnitude faster, but are a necessary component if we are to understand the environment in which life arose on the early Earth. Lastly, Ranjan et al.'s results and their evaluations are presented in a clear, compelling, and forthright fashion, representing a textbook example of the scientific method in action. Their work should be held up as a demonstration for not just enterprising young scientists but to those of us who occupy more than one discipline or that struggle to communicate with a new audience. Laying out the reasons why an experiment should be performed, developing a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the desired outcome, and then coming to terms with what did and didn't work so that the next experiment (whether yours or someone else's) showcases praise-worthy professionalism. Notably, persistent issues with maintaining anoxic conditions prevented the experiments from determining the rate of sulfur disproportionation, but the long-term constraints provided by these new data strongly suggest this process is indeed slow. As a result, we have a better idea of where we might expect the disproportionation rate to fall and where the major experimental hurdles exist in moving from order-of-magnitude estimates to clear constraints. Furthermore, the broader implication of these constraints will anchor ongoing laboratory prebiotic chemistry experiments to plausible physical conditions for the early Earth. Finally, the consideration of photolysis as dominating over disproportionation over a large fraction of the parameter space highlights further laboratory studies that will be needed to inform our understanding of the possible climate and atmospheric states on the early Earth. The authors declare no conflicts of interest relevant to this study.",
