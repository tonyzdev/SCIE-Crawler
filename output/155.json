    "abstract": "While metal nanoparticles are being increasingly used in many sectors of the economy, there is growing interest in the biological and environmental safety of their production. The main methods for nanoparticle production are chemical and physical approaches that are often costly and potentially harmful to the environment. The present review is devoted to the possibility of metal nanoparticle synthesis using plant extracts. This approach has been actively pursued in recent years as an alternative, efficient, inexpensive, and environmentally safe method for producing nanoparticles with specified properties. This review provides a detailed analysis of the various factors affecting the morphology, size, and yield of metal nanoparticles. The main focus is on the role of the natural plant biomolecules involved in the bioreduction of metal salts during the nanoparticle synthesis. Examples of effective use of exogenous biomatrices (peptides, proteins, and viral particles) to obtain nanoparticles in plant extracts are discussed.",

When the technology of aptamer selection was developed almost a quarter of a century ago, a suggestion was immediately put forward that it might be a revolutionary start into solving many problems associated with diagnostics and the therapy of diseases. However, multiple attempts to use aptamers in practice, although sometimes successful, have been generally much less efficient than had been expected initially. This review is mostly devoted not to the successful use of aptamers but to the problems impeding the widespread application of aptamers in diagnostics and therapy, as well as to approaches that could considerably expand the range of aptamer application.",

Monoclonal antibodies to the NeuN protein have been actively used in the immunohistochemical research of neuronal differentiation to assess the functional state of neurons in norm and pathology for more than 20 years. Recently, NeuN antibodies have begun to be applied in the differential morphological diagnosis of cancer. However, the structure of the protein, which can be revealed by antibodies to NeuN, remained unknown until recently, and the functions of the protein are still not fully clear. In the present mini-review, data on NeuN accumulated so far are summarized and analyzed. Data on the structure and properties of the protein, its isoforms, intracellular localization, and hypothesized functions are reported. The application field of immunocytochemical detection of NeuN in scientific and clinical studies, as well as the difficulties in the interpretation of the obtained experimental data and their possible causes, is described in details.",

    "abstract": "Cancer invasion and the ability of malignant tumor cells for directed migration and metastasis have remained a focus of research for many years. Numerous studies have confirmed the existence of two main patterns of cancer cell invasion: collective cell migration and individual cell migration, by which tumor cells overcome barriers of the extracellular matrix and spread into surrounding tissues. Each pattern of cell migration displays specific morphological features and the biochemical/molecular genetic mechanisms underlying cell migration. Two types of migrating tumor cells, mesenchymal (fibroblast-like) and amoeboid, are observed in each pattern of cancer cell invasion. This review describes the key differences between the variants of cancer cell migration, the role of epithelial-mesenchymal, collective-amoeboid, mesenchymal-amoeboid, and amoeboid-mesenchymal transitions, as well as the significance of different tumor factors and stromal molecules in tumor invasion. The data and facts collected are essential to the understanding of how the patterns of cancer cell invasion are related to cancer progression and therapy efficacy. Convincing evidence is provided that morphological manifestations of the invasion patterns are characterized by a variety of tissue (tumor) structures. The results of our own studies are presented to show the association of breast cancer progression with intratumoral morphological heterogeneity, which most likely reflects the types of cancer cell migration and results from different activities of cell adhesion molecules in tumor cells of distinct morphological structures.",

Though, there are few methods, that meet high standards of efficiency, safety and accessibility for a wide range of researchers. In 2011 and 2013 novel methods of genome editing appeared - this are TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) and CRISPR (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9 systems. Although TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 appeared recently, these systems have proved to be effective and reliable tools for genome engineering. Here we generally review application of these systems for genome editing in conventional model objects of current biology, functional genome screening, cell-based human hereditary disease modeling, epigenome studies and visualization of cellular processes. Additionally, we review general strategies for designing TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 and analyzing their activity. We also discuss some obstacles researcher can face using these genome editing tools.",

Bacterial enzymes play a key role in the emergence of resistance. Classification of these enzymes is based on their participation in various biochemical mechanisms: modification of the enzymes that act as antibiotic targets, enzymatic modification of intracellular targets, enzymatic transformation of antibiotics, and the implementation of cellular metabolism reactions. The main mechanisms of resistance development are associated with the evolution of superfamilies of bacterial enzymes due to the variability of the genes encoding them. The collection of all antibiotic resistance genes is known as the resistome. Tens of thousands of enzymes and their mutants that implement various mechanisms of resistance form a new community that is called the enzystome. Analysis of the structure and functional characteristics of enzymes, which are the targets for different classes of antibiotics, will allow us to develop new strategies for overcoming the resistance.",

However, the proteins involved in the formation and maintenance of the chromosomal architecture and the organization of regulatory domains remain insufficiently studied. This review attempts to collate the available data on the abundant but still poorly understood family of proteins with clusters of the C2H2 zinc finger domains. One of the best known proteins of this family is a well conserved protein known as CTCF, which plays a key role in the establishment of the chromosomal architecture in vertebrates. The distinctive features of C2H2 zinc finger proteins include strong and specific binding to a long and unique DNA recognition target sequence and rapid expansion within various animal taxa during evolution. The reviewed data support a proposed model according to which many of the C2H2 proteins have functions that are similar to those of the CTCF in the organization of the chromatin architecture.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol is an important constituent of cell membranes and plays a crucial role in the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane and signaling. Brain cholesterol accounts for a large proportion of the bodys total cholesterol, existing in two pools: the plasma membranes of neurons and glial cells and the myelin membranes . Cholesterol has been recently shown to be important for synaptic transmission, and a link between cholesterol metabolism defects and neurodegenerative disorders is now recognized. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by impaired cholesterol turnover in the brain. However, at which stage the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is perturbed and how this contributes to pathogenesis remains unknown. Cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration may be associated with impaired synaptic transduction. Defects in cholesterol biosynthesis can trigger dysfunction of synaptic transmission. In this review, an overview of cholesterol turnover under physiological and pathological conditions is presented (Huntingtons, Niemann-Pick type C diseases, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome). We will discuss possible mechanisms by which cholesterol content in the plasma membrane influences synaptic processes. Changes in cholesterol metabolism in Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and autistic disorders are beyond the scope of this review and will be summarized in our next paper.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence was first described as a failure of normal human cells to divide indefinitely in culture. Until recently, the emphasis in the study of cell senescence has been focused on the accompanying intracellular processes. The focus of the attention has been on the irreversible growth arrest and two important physiological functions that rely on it: suppression of carcinogenesis due to the proliferation loss of damaged cells, and the acceleration of organism aging due to the deterioration of the tissue repair mechanism with age. However, the advances of the past years have revealed that senescent cells can impact the surrounding tissue microenvironment, and, thus, that the main consequences of senescence are not solely mediated by intracellular alterations. Recent studies have provided evidence that a pool of molecules secreted by senescent cells, including cytokines, chemokines, proteases and growth factors, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), via autocrine/paracrine pathways can affect neighboring cells. Today it is clear that SASP functionally links cell senescence to various biological processes, such as tissue regeneration and remodeling, embryonic development, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. The present article aims to describe the social life of senescent cells: basically, SASP constitution, molecular mechanisms of its regulation, and its functional role.",

At pH 7.4, the cell zeta potential for different types of cells showed variations over a wide range and was equal to -19.4 ± 0.8 mV for HeLa cells and -31.8 ± 1.1 mV for erythrocytes. The difference could presumably be attributed to the differences in the biochemical composition of the cell plasma membrane. As a result of the heating of HeLa cells, the zeta potential shifted towards more negative voltages by 4.2 mV. An increase in the zeta potential correlated with an increase in the content of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface, which is considered to be an early marker of apoptosis. The DLS technique was also used to study the interactions between the cells and membranotropic polymers, such as polycations and nonionogenic Pluronic L121.",

    "abstract": "Silver nanoparticles (NPs), widely used in the manufacture of various types of consumer products and for medical applications, belong to novel types of materials that pose potential risks to human health. The potential negative effects of the influence of these NPs on reproduction are insufficiently researched. A quantitative assessment of the transfer of metallic silver nanoparticles through the placenta and breast milk was carried out during an in vivo experiment. We used 34.9 14.8 nm in size silver NPs that were stabilized by low-molecularweight polyvinylpyrrolidone and labeled with the 110mAg radioactive isotope using thermal neutron irradiation in a nuclear reactor. [110mAg]-labeled NPs preparations were administered intragastrically via a gavage needle to pregnant (20th day of gestation) or lactating (14-16th day of lactation) female rats at a dose of 1.69-2.21 mg/kg of body weight upon conversion into silver. The accumulation of NPs in rat fetuses and infant rats consuming their mothers breast milk was evaluated using a low-background semiconductor gamma-ray spectrometer 24 and 48 hours following labeling, respectively. In all cases, we observed a penetration of the [110mAg]-labeled NPs through the placenta and ther entry into the mothers milk in amounts exceeding by 100-1,000 times the sensitivity of the utilized analytical method. The average level of accumulation of NPs in fetuses was 0.085-0.147% of the administered dose, which was comparable to the accumulation of the label in the liver, blood, and muscle carcass of adult animals and exceeded the penetration of NPs across the hematoencephalic barrier into the brain of females by a factor of 10-100. In lactating females, the total accumulation of [110mAg]-labeled NPs into the milk exceeded 1.94 0.29% of the administered dose over a 48 h period of lactation; not less than 25% of this amount was absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract of infant rats. Thus, this was the first time experimental evidence of the transfer of NPs from mother to offspring through the placenta and breast milk was obtained.",

    "abstract": "The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) enzyme is one of the promising molecular targets for the discovery of antitumor drugs. PARP1 is a common nuclear protein (1-2 million molecules per cell) serving as a sensor for DNA strand breaks. Increased PARP1 expression is sometimes observed in melanomas, breast cancer, lung cancer, and other neoplastic diseases. The PARP1 expression level is a prognostic indicator and is associated with a poor survival prognosis. There is evidence that high PARP1 expression and treatment-resistance of tumors are correlated. PARP1 inhibitors are promising antitumor agents, since they act as chemo- and radiosensitizers in the conventional therapy of malignant tumors. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitors can be used as independent, effective drugs against tumors with broken DNA repair mechanisms. Currently, third-generation PARP1 inhibitors are being developed, many of which are undergoing Phase II clinical trials. In this review, we focus on the properties and features of the PARP1 inhibitors identified in preclinical and clinical trials. We also describe some problems associated with the application of PARP1 inhibitors. The possibility of developing new PARP1 inhibitors aimed at DNA binding and transcriptional activity rather than the catalytic domain of the protein is discussed.",

MiRNAs are key regulators of the immune response that affect maturation, proliferation, differentiation, and activation of immune cells, as well as antibody secretion and release of inflammatory mediators. Disruption of this regulation may lead to the development of various pathological conditions, including autoimmune inflammation.

The eucaryotic NER system eliminates DNA damage by the excision of 24-32 nt single-strand oligonucleotides from a damaged strand, followed by restoration of an intact double helix by DNA repair synthesis and DNA ligation.

Slow-type fibers demonstrate a high level of fatigue resistance and prolonged contraction duration, but decreased maximum contraction force and velocity. Fast-type fibers demonstrate high contraction force and velocity, but profound fatigability. During the last decades, it has been discovered that all these properties are determined by the predominance of slow or fast myosin-heavy-chain (MyHC) isoforms. It was observed that gravitational unloading during space missions and simulated microgravity in ground-based experiments leads to the transformation of some slow-twitch muscle fibers into fast-twitch ones due to changes in the patterns of MyHC gene expression in the postural soleus muscle. The present review covers the facts and mechanistic speculations regarding myosin phenotype remodeling under conditions of gravitational unloading. The review considers the neuronal mechanisms of muscle fiber control and molecular mechanisms of regulation of myosin gene expression, such as inhibition of the calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling pathway, epigenomic changes, and the behavior of specific microRNAs. In the final portion of the review, we discuss the adaptive role of myosin phenotype transformations.",

Despite extensive research into the causes of these diseases, clinical researchers have had very limited progress and, as of now, there is still no cure for any of these diseases. One of the main obstacles in the way of creating treatments for these disorders is the fact that their etiology and pathophysiology still remain unclear. This paper reviews results that support the so-called \"calcium hypothesis of neurodegenerative diseases.\" The calcium hypothesis states that the atrophic and degenerative processes in the neurons of AD, PD, ALS, HD, and SCA patients are accompanied by alterations in calcium homeostasis. Moreover, the calcium hypothesis states that this deregulation of calcium signaling is one of the early-stage and key processes in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Based on the results we reviewed, we conclude that the calcium channels and other proteins involved in the neuronal calcium signaling system are potential drug targets for AD, PD, ALS, HD, and SCA therapy.",

TLRs are found in many different cell types, ranging from epithelial to immunocompetent cells. TLR binding triggers the expression of several adapter proteins and downstream kinases, leading to the induction of key pro-inflammatory mediators. This results in the activation of both the innate immune response (elevated expression of antiapoptotic proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, and antibacterial proteins), as well as the adaptive immune response (maturation of the dendritic cells, antigen presentation, etc.). In consequence of their ability to enhance the specific and nonspecific immune reactions of an organism, TLR agonists are widely used in the therapy of infectious diseases and, as adjuvants, in the therapy of malignant neoplasia. However, to date, TLRs have had the opposite effects on tumor progression. On the one hand, TLR ligands can suppress tumor growth. On the other hand, TLR agonists can promote the survival of malignant cells and increase their resistance to chemotherapy. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available data on the effects of TLRs and their agonists on tumor progression, as well as the mechanisms underlying the differences in the effects of TLRs on tumor growth.",

Continuously growing interest in the study of this class of compounds is fueled by a number of factors: (i) a growing need for large-scale production of natural 2'-deoxy-β-D-ribonucleosides as well as their analogs with modifications in the carbohydrate and base fragments, which can then be used for the synthesis and study of oligonucleotides, including short-interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA), etc.; (ii) a necessity for the development of efficient practical technologies for the production of biologically important analogs of natural nucleosides, including a number of anticancer and antiviral drugs; (iii) a need for further study of known and novel enzymatic transformations and their use as tools for the efficient synthesis of new nucloside analogs and derivates with biomedical potential. This article will review all of these aspects and also include a brief retrospect of this field of research.",

    "abstract": "Cytokinins belong to one of the most important and well-known classes of plant hormones. Discovered over half a century ago, cytokinins have retained the attention of researchers due to the variety of the effects they have on the growth and development of vegetable organisms, their participation in a plant adaptation to external conditions, and the potential to be used in biotechnology, agriculture, medicine and even cosmetics. The molecular mechanism by which cytokinins function remained unknown for a long time. Things started to change only in the 21(st)century, after the discovery of the receptors for these phytohormones. It appeared that plants found ways to adapt a two-component signal transduction system borrowed from prokaryotic organisms for cytokinin signalling. This review covers the recent advances in research of the molecular basis for the perception and transduction of the cytokinin signal. Emphasis is placed on cytokinin receptors, their domain and three-dimensional structures, subcellular localization, signalling activity, effect of mutations, ligand-binding properties, and phylogeny.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease affects people all over the world, regardless of nationality, gender or social status. An adequate study of the disease requires essential understanding of the molecular fundamentals of the pathogenesis. The amyloid β-peptide, which forms amyloid plaques in the brain of people with Alzheimer's disease, is the product of sequential cleavage of a single-span membrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). More than half of the APP mutations found to be associated with familial forms of Alzheimer's disease are located in its transmembrane domain. The pathogenic mutations presumably affect the structural-dynamic properties of the APP transmembrane domain by changing its conformational stability and/or lateral dimerization. In the present study, the structure and dynamics of the recombinant peptide corresponding to the APP fragment, Gln686-Lys726, which comprises the APP transmembrane domain with an adjacent N-terminal juxtamembrane sequence, were determined in the membrane mimetic environment composed of detergent micelles using NMR spectroscopy. The structure obtained in dodecylphosphocholine micelles consists of two α-helices: a short surface-associated juxtamembrane helix (Lys687-Asp694) and a long transmembrane helix (Gly700-Leu723), both connected via a mobile loop region. A minor bend of the transmembrane α-helix is observed near the paired residues Gly708-Gly709. A cholesterol-binding hydrophobic cavity is apparently formed under the loop region, where the juxtamembrane α-helix comes into contact with the membrane surface near the N-terminus of the transmembrane α-helix.",

Here, we have analyzed disruptions in cholesterol homeostasis in widespread neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases) and autism spectrum disorders. We particularly focused on the synaptic dysfunctions that could arise from changes in both membrane cholesterol availability and oxysterol production. Notably, alterations in the brain cholesterol metabolism and neurotransmission occur in the early stages of these pathologies and the polymorphism of the genes associated with cholesterol homeostasis and synaptic communication affects the risk of onset and severity of these diseases. In addition, pharmacological and genetic manipulations of brain cholesterol homeostasis in animal models frequently have marked effects on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the development of Alzheimers, Parkinsons and autism spectrum disorders may be partially associated with an imbalance of cholesterol homeostasis that leads to changes in the membrane cholesterol and oxysterol levels that, in turn, modulates key steps in the synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia is one of the most severe gestational complications which is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A growth in the incidence of severe and combined forms of the pathology has been observed in recent years. According to modern concepts, inadequate cytotrophoblast invasion into the spiral arteries of the uterus and development of the ischemia-reperfusion syndrome in the placental tissue play the leading role in the development of preeclampsia, which is characterized by multipleorgan failure. In this regard, our work was aimed at studying the patterns of placental tissue transcriptome that are specific to females with PE and with physiological pregnancy, as well as identifying the potential promising biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of this pathology. We have identified 63 genes whose expression proved to differ significantly in the placental tissue of females with PE and with physiological pregnancy. A cluster of differentially expressed genes (DEG) whose expression level is increased in patients with preeclampsia includes not only the known candidate genes that have been identified in many other genome-wide studies (e.g., LEP, BHLHB2, SIGLEC6, RDH13, BCL6), but also new genes (ANKRD37, SYDE1, CYBA, ITGB2, etc.), which can be considered as new biological markers of preeclampsia and are of further interest. The results of a functional annotation of DEG show that the development of preeclampsia may be related to a stress response, immune processes, the regulation of cell-cell interactions, intracellular signaling cascades, etc. In addition, the features of the differential gene expression depending on preeclampsia severity were revealed. We have found evidence of the important role of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the failure of immunological tolerance and initiation of the pro-inflammatory cascade in the development of severe preeclampsia. The results obtained elaborate the concept of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and contain the information necessary to work out measures for targeted therapy of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived compounds with an estrogen-like activity. In mammalians, phytoestrogens bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) and participate in the regulation of cell growth and gene transcription. There are several reports of the cytotoxic effects of phytoestrogens in different cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to measure the phytoestrogen activity against breast cancer cells with different levels of ER expression and to elucidate the molecular pathways regulated by the leader compound. Methods used in the study include immunoblotting, transfection with a luciferase reporter vector, and a MTT test. We demonstrated the absence of a significant difference between ER+ and ER- breast cancer cell lines in their response to cytotoxic stimuli: treatment with high doses of phytoestrogens (apigenin, genistein, quercetin, naringenin) had the same efficiency in ER-positive and ER-negative cells. Incubation of breast cancer cells with apigenin revealed the highest cytotoxicity of this compound; on the contrary, naringenin treatment resulted in a low cytotoxic activity. It was shown that high doses of apigenin (50 μM) do not display estrogen-like activity and can suppress ER activation by 17β-estradiol. Cultivation of HER2-positive breast cancer SKBR3 cells in the presence of apigenin resulted in a decrease in HER2/neu expression, accompanied by cleavage of an apoptosis substrate PARP. Therefore, the cytotoxic effects of phytoestrogens are not associated with the steroid receptors of breast cancer cells. Apigenin was found to be the most effective phytoestrogen that strongly inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells, including HER2-positive ones.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most widespread and troublesome opportunistic pathogens that is capable of colonizing various human tissues and organs and is often resistant to many currently used antibiotics. This resistance is caused by different factors, including the acquisition of specific resistance genes, intrinsic capability to diminish antibiotic penetration into the bacterial cell, and the ability to form biofilms. This situation has prompted the development of novel compounds differing in their mechanism of action from traditional antibiotics that suppress the growth of microorganisms or directly kill bacteria. Instead, these new compounds should decrease the pathogens' ability to colonize and damage human tissues by inhibiting the virulence factors and biofilm formation. The lectins LecA and LecB that bind galactose and fucose, as well as oligo- and polysaccharides containing these sugars, are among the most thoroughly-studied targets for such novel antibacterials. In this review, we summarize the results of experiments highlighting the importance of these proteins for P. aeruginosa pathogenicity and provide information on existing lectins inhibitors and their effectiveness in various experimental models. Particular attention is paid to the effects of lectins inhibition in animal models of infection and in clinical practice. We argue that lectins inhibition is a perspective approach to combating P. aeruginosa. However, despite the existence of highly effective in vitro inhibitors, further experiments are required in order to advance these inhibitors into pre-clinical studies.",

One of the main targets of the toxic components from snake venoms is the cardiovascular system. Venom proteins and peptides can act in different ways, exhibiting either cardiotoxic or cardioprotective effects. The principal classes of these compounds are cobra cardiotoxins, phospholipases A2, and natriuretic, as well as bradykinin-potentiating peptides. There is another group of proteins capable of enhancing angiogenesis, which include, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factors possessing hypotensive and cardioprotective activities. Venom proteins and peptides exhibiting cardiotropic and vasoactive effects are promising candidates for the design of new drugs capable of preventing or constricting the development of pathological processes in cardiovascular diseases, which are currently the leading cause of death worldwide. For example, a bradykinin-potentiating peptide from Bothrops jararaca snake venom was the first snake venom compound used to create the widely used antihypertensive drugs captopril and enalapril. In this paper, we review the current state of research on snake venom components affecting the cardiovascular system and analyse the mechanisms of physiological action of these toxins and the prospects for their medical application.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is an enzyme that maintains the length of the telomere. The telomere length specifies the number of divisions a cell can undergo before it finally dies (i.e. the proliferative potential of cells). For example, telomerase is activated in embryonic cell lines and the telomere length is maintained at a constant level; therefore, these cells have an unlimited fission potential. Stem cells are characterized by a lower telomerase activity, which enables only partial compensation for the shortening of telomeres. Somatic cells are usually characterized by the absence of telomerase activity. Telomere shortening leads to the attainment of the Hayflick limit, the transition of cells to a state of senescence. The cells subsequently enter a state of crisis, accompanied by massive cell death. The surviving cells become cancer cells, which are capable both of dividing indefinitely and maintaining telomere length (usually with the aid of telomerase). Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase. It consists of two major components: telomerase RNA (TER) and reverse transcriptase (TERT). TER is a non-coding RNA, and it contains the region which serves as a template for telomere synthesis. An increasing number of articles focussing on the alternative functions of telomerase components have recently started appearing. The present review summarizes data on the structure, biogenesis, and functions of telomerase.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease of polygenic etiology affecting the central nervous system. In addition to genetic factors, epigenetic mechanisms, primarily DNA methylation, which regulate gene expression, play an important role in MS development and progression. In this study, we have performed the first whole-genome DNA methylation profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS) patients and compared them to those of healthy individuals in order to identify the differentially methylated CpG-sites (DMSs) associated with these common clinical disease courses. In addition, we have performed a pairwise comparison of DNA methylation profiles in RRMS and PPMS patients. All three pairwise comparisons showed significant differences in methylation profiles. Hierarchical clustering of the identified DMS methylation levels and principal component analysis for data visualization demonstrated a clearly defined aggregation of DNA samples of the compared groups into separate clusters. Compared with the control, more DMSs were identified in PPMS patients than in RRMS patients (67 and 30, respectively). More than half of DMSs are located in genes, exceeding the expected number for random distribution of DMSs between probes. RRMS patients mostly have hypomethylated DMSs, while in PPMS patients DMSs are mostly hypermethylated. CpG-islands and CpG-shores contain 60% of DMSs, identified by pairwise comparison of RRMS and control groups, and 79% of those identified by pairwise comparison of PPMS and control groups. Pairwise comparison of patients with two clinical MS courses revealed 51 DMSs, 82% of which are hypermethylated in PPMS. Overall, it was demonstrated that there are more changes in the DNA methylation profiles in PPMS than in RRMS. The data confirm the role of DNA methylation in MS development. We have shown, for the first time, that DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism is involved in the formation of two distinct clinical courses of MS: namely, RRMS and PPMS.",

Their increased conformational stability is among the main reasons for the high thermal stability of proteins in thermophilic bacteria. In addition, α-helices are often involved in protein interactions with other proteins, nucleic acids, and the lipids of cell membranes. That is why the highly stable α-helical peptides used as highly active and specific inhibitors of protein-protein and other interactions have recently found more applications in medicine. Several different approaches have been developed in recent years to improve the conformational stability of α-helical peptides and thermostable proteins, which will be discussed in this review. We also discuss the methods for improving the permeability of peptides and proteins across cellular membranes and their resistance to intracellular protease activity. Special attention is given to the SEQOPT method (http://mml.spbstu.ru/services/seqopt/), which is used to design conformationally stable short α-helices.",

It participates in blood cell formation, forms mesoderm in early embryogenesis, and regulates hematopoiesis in adult organisms. TAL1 is essential in maintaining the multipotency of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and keeping them in quiescence (stage G0). TAL1 forms complexes with various transcription factors, regulating hematopoiesis (E2A/HEB, GATA1-3, LMO1-2, Ldb1, ETO2, RUNX1, ERG, FLI1). In these complexes, TAL1 regulates normal myeloid differentiation, controls the proliferation of erythroid progenitors, and determines the choice of the direction of HSC differentiation. The transcription factors TAL1, E2A, GATA1 (or GATA2), LMO2, and Ldb1 are the major components of the SCL complex. In addition to normal hematopoiesis, this complex may also be involved in the process of blood cell malignant transformation. Upregulation of C-KIT expression is one of the main roles played by the SCL complex. Today, TAL1 and its partners are considered promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

    "abstract": "At the moment, developing new broad-spectrum influenza vaccines which would help avoid annual changes in a vaccines strain set is urgency. In addition, developing new vaccines based on highly conserved influenza virus proteins could allow us to better prepare for potential pandemics and significantly reduce the damage they cause. Evaluation of the humoral response to vaccine administration is a key aspect of the characterization of the effectiveness of influenza vaccines. In the development of new broad-spectrum influenza vaccines, it is important to study the mechanisms of action of various antibodies, including non-neutralizing ones, as well as to be in the possession of methods for quantifying these antibodies after immunization with new vaccines against influenza. In this review, we focused on the mechanisms of anti-influenza action of non-neutralizing antibodies, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The influenza virus antigens that trigger these reactions are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as highly conserved antigens, such as M2 (ion channel), M1 (matrix protein), and NP (nucleoprotein). In addition, the mechanisms of action and methods for detecting antibodies to neuraminidase (NA) and to the stem domain of hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus are considered.",

The development of nanomedicine offers new ways of increasing the therapeutic index and minimizing side effects. The development of photoactivatable dyes that are effectively absorbed in the first transparency window of biological tissues (700900 nm) and are capable of fluorescence and heat generation has led to the emergence of phototheranostics, an approach that combines the bioimaging of deep tumors and metastases and their photothermal treatment. The creation of near-infrared (NIR) light-activated agents for sensitive fluorescence bioimaging and phototherapy is a priority in phototheranostics, because the excitation of drugs and/or diagnostic substances in the near-infrared region exhibits advantages such as deep penetration into tissues and a weak baseline level of autofluorescence. In this review, we focus on NIR-excited dyes and discuss prospects for their application in photothermal therapy and the diagnosis of cancer. Particular attention is focused on the consideration of new multifunctional nanoplatforms for phototheranostics which allow one to achieve a synergistic effect in combinatorial photothermal, photodynamic, and/or chemotherapy, with simultaneous fluorescence, acoustic, and/or magnetic resonance imaging.",

    "abstract": "Progressive loss of the telomeric ends of chromosomes caused by the semi-conservative mechanism of DNA replication is an important timing mechanism which controls the number of cells doubling. Telomerase is an enzyme which elongates one chain of the telomeric DNA and compensates for its shortening during replication. Therefore, telomerase activity serves as a proliferation marker. Telomerase activity is not detected in most somatic cells, with the exception of embryonic tissues, stem cells, and reproductive organs. In most tumor cells (80-90%), telomerase is activated and plays the role of the main instrument that supports the telomere length, which can be used for the diagnostics of neoplastic transformation. This is the primary reason why assays regarding the development of telomerase activity have attracted the attention of researchers. Telomerase activity testing may be useful in the search for telomerase inhibitors, which have the potential to be anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, telomerase activation may play a positive role in tissue regeneration; e.g., after partial removal of the liver or cardiac infarction. All telomerase activity detection assays can be divided into two large groups: those based on direct detection of telomerase products, and those based on different systems of amplification of the signals from DNA that yield from telomerase. The methods discussed in this review are suitable for testing telomerase activity in different samples: in protozoa and mammalian cells, mixed cellular populations, and tissues.",

The taxonomic composition of the microbiome was analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Both the taxonomic and functional gene content of the microbiome of one participant were analyzed by whole metagenome sequencing using the SOLiD technique. Each participant had a specific microbiome that could be assigned to one of three recognized enterotypes. Two participants had enterotype I microbiomes characterized by the prevalence of Bacteroides, while the microbiomes of two others, assigned to type II, were dominated by Prevotella. One participant had a microbiome of mixed type. It was found that (1) changes in the taxonimic composition of the microbiomes occurred in the course of the experiment, but the enterotypes remained the same; (2) significant changes in the compositions of the microbiomes occurred just 14-30 days after the beginning of the experiment, presumably indicating the influence of stress factors in the first stage of the experiment; (3) a tendency toward a reversion of the microbiomes to their initial composition was observed two weeks after the end of the experiment, but complete recovery was not achieved. The metagenomic analysis of the microbiome of one of the participants showed that in spite of variations in the taxonomic compositions of microbiomes, the functional genetic composition was much more stable for most of the functional gene categories. Probably in the course of the experiment the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome was adaptively changed to reflect the individual response to the experimental conditions. A new, balanced taxonomic composition of the microbiome was formed to ensure a stable gene content of the community as a whole without negative consequences for the health of the participants.",

    "abstract": "The coactivator PGC-1α is the key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle expresses several PGC-1α isoforms. This review covers the functional role of PGC-1α isoforms and the regulation of their exercise-associated expression in skeletal muscle. The patterns of PGC-1α mRNA expression may markedly differ at rest and after muscle activity. Different signaling pathways are activated by different physiological stimuli, which regulate the expression of the PGC-1α gene from the canonical and alternative promoters: expression from a canonical (proximal) promoter is regulated by activation of the AMPK; expression from an alternative promoter, via a β2-adrenergic receptor. All transcripts from both promoters are subject to alternative splicing. As a result, truncated isoforms that possess different properties are translated: truncated isoforms are more stable and predominantly activate angiogenesis, whereas full-length isoforms manly regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. The existence of several isoforms partially explains the broad-spectrum function of this protein and allows the organism to adapt to different physiological stimuli. Regulation of the PGC-1α gene expression by different signaling pathways provides ample opportunity for pharmacological influence on the expression of this gene. Those opportunities might be important for the treatment and prevention of various diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of the PGC-1α gene expression and their functional role may provide an opportunity to control the expression of different isoforms through exercise and/or pharmacological intervention.",

    "abstract": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of the most dangerous infections affecting humans and animals. The first EVD outbreaks occurred in 1976 in Sudan and Zaire. Since then, more than 20 outbreaks have occurred; the largest of which (2014-2016) evolved into an epidemic in West Africa and claimed the lives of more than 11,000 people. Although vaccination is the most effective way to prevent epidemics, there was no licensed vaccine for EVD at the beginning of the latest outbreak. The development of the first vaccines for EVD started in 1980 and has come a long technological way, from inactivated to genetically engineered vaccines based on recombinant viral vectors. This review focuses on virus-vectored Ebola vaccines that have demonstrated the greatest efficacy in preclinical trials and are currently under different phases of clinical trial. Particular attention is paid to the mechanisms of immune response development, which are important for protection from EVD, and the key vaccine parameters necessary for inducing long-term protective immunity against EVD.",

    "abstract": "This review focuses on modeling of cancer tumors using tissue engineering technology. Tumor tissue engineering (TTE) is a new method of three-dimensional (3D) simulation of malignant neoplasms. Design and development of complex tissue engineering constructs (TECs) that include cancer cells, cell-bearing scaffolds acting as the extracellular matrix, and other components of the tumor microenvironment is at the core of this approach. Although TECs can be transplanted into laboratory animals, the specific aim of TTE is the most realistic reproduction and long-term maintenance of the simulated tumor properties in vitro for cancer biology research and for the development of new methods of diagnosis and treatment of malignant neoplasms. Successful implementation of this challenging idea depends on bioreactor technology, which will enable optimization of culture conditions and control of tumor TECs development. In this review, we analyze the most popular bioreactor types in TTE and the emerging applications.",

    "abstract": "Since 1980, in the post-smallpox vaccination era the human population has become increasingly susceptible compared to a generation ago to not only the variola (smallpox) virus, but also other zoonotic orthopoxviruses. The need for safer vaccines against orthopoxviruses is even greater now. The Lister vaccine strain (LIVP) of vaccinia virus was used as a parental virus for generating a recombinant 1421ABJCN clone defective in five virulence genes encoding hemagglutinin (A56R), the IFN--binding protein (B8R), thymidine kinase (J2R), the complement-binding protein (C3L), and the Bcl-2-like inhibitor of apoptosis (N1L). We found that disruption of these loci does not affect replication in mammalian cell cultures. The isogenic recombinant strain 1421ABJCN exhibits a reduced inflammatory response and attenuated neurovirulence relative to LIVP. Virus titers of 1421ABJCN were 3 lg lower versus the parent VACV LIVP when administered by the intracerebral route in new-born mice. In a subcutaneous mouse model, 1421ABJCN displayed levels of VACV-neutralizing antibodies comparable to those of LIVP and conferred protective immunity against lethal challenge by the ectromelia virus. The VACV mutant holds promise as a safe live vaccine strain for preventing smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown by an X-ray structural analysis that the amino acid residues Ala198, which are located in the coenzyme-binding domain of NAD(+)-dependent formate dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.2., FDH) from bacteria Pseudomonas sp.101 and Moraxella sp. C-1 (PseFDH and MorFDH, respectively), have non-optimal values of the angles ψ and φ. These residues were replaced with Gly by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants PseFDH A198G and MorFDH A198G were expressed in E.coli cells and obtained in active and soluble forms with more than 95% purity. The study of thermal inactivation kinetics showed that the mutation A198G results in a 2.5- fold increase in stability compared to one for the wild-type enzymes. Kinetic experiments indicate that A198G replacement reduces the KM (NAD+) value from 60 to 35 and from 80 to 45 μM for PseFDH and MorFDH, respectively, while the KM (HCOO-) value remains practically unchanged. Amino acid replacement A198G was also added to the mutant PseFDH D221S with the coenzyme specificity changed from NAD(+) to NADP(+). In this case, an increase in thermal stability was also observed, but the influence of the mutation on the kinetic parameters was opposite: KM increased from 190 to 280 μM and from 43 to 89 mM for NADP(+) and formate, respectively. According to the data obtained, inference could be drawn that earlier formate dehydrogenase from bacterium Pseudomonas sp. 101 was specific to NADP(+), but not to NAD(+).",

The class of transcription factors that carry a cluster of C2H2-type zinc fingers consisting of five or more domains (C2H2 proteins) is widely represented in all groups of animals.

    "abstract": "Bioscavengers are biopharmaceuticals that specifically react with toxicants. Thus, enzymes reacting with poisonous esters can be used as bioscavengers for neutralization of toxic molecules before they reach physiological targets. Parenteral administration of bioscavengers is, therefore, intended for prophylaxis or pre-treatments, emergency and post-exposure treatments of intoxications. These enzymes can also be used for application on skin, mucosa and wounds as active components of topical skin protectants and decontamination solutions. Human butyrylcholinesterase is the first stoichiometric bioscavenger for safe and efficient prophylaxis of organophosphate poisoning. However, huge amounts of a costly enzyme are needed for protection. Thus, the bioscavenger approach will be greatly improved by the use of catalytic bioscavengers. Catalytic bioscavengers are enzymes capable of degrading toxic esters with a turnover. Suitable catalytic bioscavengers are engineered mutants of human enzymes. Efficient mutants of human butyrylcholinesterase have been made that hydrolyze cocaine at a high rate. Mutants of human cholinesterases capable of hydrolyzing OPs have been made, but so far their activity is too low to be of medical interest. Human paraoxonase a promiscuous plasma enzyme is certainly the most promising phosphotriesterase. However, its biotechnology is still in its infancy. Other enzymes and proteins from blood and organs, and secondary biological targets of OPs and carbamates are potential bioscavengers, in particular serum albumin that reacts with OPs and self-reactivates. Lastly, non-human enzymes, phosphotriesterases and oxidases from various bacterial and eukaryotic sources could be used for external use against OP poisoning and for internal use after modifications for immunological compatibility.",

In the present work, heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations were used to demonstrate that the two most widely used media (detergent DPC micelles and lipid DMPC/DHPC bicelles) enable to perform structural studies of the specific interactions between transmembrane a-helices by the example of dimerizing the transmembrane domain of the bitopic protein glycophorin A.

    "abstract": "Non-thermal plasma (NTP) consists of a huge amount of biologically active particles, whereas its temperature is close to ambient. This combination allows one to use NTP as a perspective tool for solving different biomedical tasks, including antitumor therapy. The treatment of tumor cells with NTP caused dose-dependent effects, such as growth arrest and apoptosis. However, while the outcome of NTP treatment has been established, the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between NTP and eukaryotic cells have not been thoroughly studied thus far. In this work, the mechanisms and the type of death of human colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells upon application of non-thermal argon plasma were studied. The effect of NTP on the major stress-activated protein p53 was investigated. The results demonstrate that the viability of HCT116 cells upon plasma treatment is dependent on the functional p53 protein. NTP treatment caused an increase in the intracellular concentration of p53 and the induction of the p53-controlled regulon. The p53-dependent accumulation of active proapoptotic caspase-3 was shown in NTP-treated cells. The study was the first to demonstrate that treatment of human colon carcinoma cells with NTP results in p53-dependent apoptosis. The results obtained contribute to our understanding of the applicability of NTP in antitumor therapy.",

    "abstract": "Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are now being used in many sectors of industry; however, the impact of ENPs on the environment still requires further study, since their use, recycling, and accidental spill can result in the accumulation of nanoparticles in the atmosphere, soil, and water. Plants are an integral part of ecosystems; hence their interaction with ENPs is inevitable. It is important to understand the consequences of this interaction and assess its potential effects. The present research is focused on studying the effects of the industrial material Taunit, containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), on plants, and testing of its ability to penetrate into plant cells and tissues. Taunit has been found to stimulate the growth of roots and stems and cause an increase in peroxidase activity in Onobrychis arenaria seedlings. Peroxidase activity increases with decreasing concentration of Taunit from 1,000 to 100 mg/l. MWNTs from Taunit were detected in the cells and tissues of seedling roots and leaves, implying the ability of MWNTs to penetrate into roots and accumulate there, as well as their ability to be transported into seedling leaves. Thus, the changes in the physiological parameters of plants are associated not only with MWNT adsorption on the root surface, as previously believed, but also with their penetration, uptake and accumulation in the plant cells and tissues.",

Extracellular ribonuclease of Bacilli (binase) was shown to manifest antiviral activity during single- and multi-cycle viral replication in the range of concentrations non-toxic to epithelial cells and 0.01-0.1 multiplicity of infection. During antiviral treatment for 15-30 min, the concentration of 1 μg/ml binase reduced the amount of focus-forming units of viruses by a factor of 3-10 and suppressed the virus-induced cytopathic effect in A549 human lung cells. The possible mechanisms of interaction between the virus and enzyme are discussed. Positive charges in both binase and viral hemagglutinin cause electrostatic interaction with negatively charged sialic acid on the host cell's surface followed by its penetration into the cell. Capsid elimination and release of viral RNA from endosome to the cytoplasm allows catalytic RNA cleavage by internalized binase. The data obtained confirm that binase is an effective antiviral agent against the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. Certain progress in this field is associated with clarifying the detailed mechanism underlying the antiviral action of binase and development of the most effective way for its practical use.",

Derivatives F12 and F94 were found to inhibit the biosynthesis of GFP from the promoter of the eps operon encoding genes of the biofilm exopolysaccharide synthesis (EPS). Using the differential fluorescence staining of alive/dead cells, we demonstrated an increased bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics (kanamycin and chloramphenicol) in the presence of F12, F15, and F94, with F12 being the most efficient one. The derivative F15 was capable of disrupting an already formed biofilm and thereby increasing the efficiency of antibiotics.",

In contrast to neurotoxins with an overall similar fold, CTs are amphiphilic. The amphiphilicity is caused by positively charged lysine and arginine residues flanking the tips of the loops that consist primarily of hydrophobic amino acids. A similar distribution of amino acid residues is typical for linear (without disulfide bonds) cationic cytolytic peptides from the venoms of other snakes and insects. Many of them are now considered to be lead compounds in combatting bacterial infections and cancer. In the present review, we summarize the data on the antibacterial activity of CTs and compare it to the activity of linear peptides.",

    "abstract": "Some viral strains of the Paramyxoviridae family may be used as anti-tumor agents. Oncolytic paramyxoviruses include attenuated strains of the measles virus, Newcastle disease virus, and Sendai virus. These viral strains, and the Sendai virus in particular, can preferentially induce the death of malignant, rather than normal, cells. The death of cancer cells results from both direct killing by the virus and through virus-induced activation of anticancer immunity. Sialic-acid-containing glycoproteins that are overexpressed in cancer cells serve as receptors for some oncolytic paramyxoviruses and ensure preferential interaction of paramyxoviruses with malignant cells. Frequent genetic defects in interferon and apoptotic response systems that are common to cancer cells ensure better susceptibility of malignant cells to viruses. The Sendai virus as a Paramyxovirus is capable of inducing the formation of syncytia, multinuclear cell structures which promote viral infection spread within a tumor without virus exposure to host neutralizing antibodies. As a result, the Sendai virus can cause mass killing of malignant cells and tumor destruction. Oncolytic paramyxoviruses can also promote the immune-mediated elimination of malignant cells. In particular, they are powerful inducers of interferon and other cytokynes promoting antitumor activity of various cell components of the immune response, such as dendritic and natural killer cells, as well as cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Taken together these mechanisms explain the impressive oncolytic activity of paramyxoviruses that hold promise as future, efficient anticancer therapeutics.",

The concept of pro-drugs allows researchers to look for new approaches to obtain effective drugs with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Thiosulfinates, formed enzymatically from amino acid sulfoxides upon crushing cells of genus Allium plants, are known as antimicrobial compounds. The instability and high reactivity of thiosulfinates complicate their use as individual antimicrobial compounds. We propose a pharmacologically complementary pair: an amino acid sulfoxide pro-drug and vitamin B6 - dependent methionine γ-lyase, which metabolizes it in the patient's body. The enzyme catalyzes the γ- and β-elimination reactions of sulfoxides, analogues of L-methionine and L-cysteine, which leads to the formation of thiosulfinates. In the present work, we cloned the enzyme gene from Clostridium sporogenes. Ionic and tautomeric forms of the internal aldimine were determined by lognormal deconvolution of the holoenzyme spectrum and the catalytic parameters of the recombinant enzyme in the γ- and β-elimination reactions of amino acids, and some sulfoxides of amino acids were obtained. For the first time, the possibility of usage of the enzyme for effective conversion of sulfoxides was established and the antimicrobial activity of thiosulfinates against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in situ was shown.",

    "abstract": "A mechanism for the induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) upon dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain has been studied. Previously, we had found that inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome bc1, a component of the electron transport chain complex III, leads to activation of tumor suppressor p53, followed by apoptosis induction. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is coupled to the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway via the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). The p53 activation induced in response to the inhibition of the electron transport chain complex III has been shown to be triggered by the impairment of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis due to the suppression of DHODH. However, it remained unclear whether the suppression of the DHODH function is the main cause of the observed apoptotic cell death. Here, we show that apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells induced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III inhibition can be prevented by supplementation with uridine or orotate (products of the reaction catalyzed by DHODH) rather than with dihydroorotate (a DHODH substrate). We conclude that apoptosis is induced in response to the impairment of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis caused by the inhibition of DHODH. The conclusion is supported by the experiment showing that downregulation of DHODH by RNA interference leads to accumulation of the p53 tumor suppressor and to apoptotic cell death.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) demonstrates considerable intratumoral morphological heterogeneity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the relationship among different morphological structures, the rate of metastasis, and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in NAC-treated (n = 427) and NAC-nave (n = 249) BC patients. We also studied the involvement of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the development of the intratumoral morphological heterogeneity of BC. We found a significant association between the intratumoral morphological heterogeneity and the rate of BC metastasis and response to NAC, which, in most cases, correlated with the presence of alveolar and trabecular structures. In particular, the rate of lymph node metastasis in tumors containing alveolar and trabecular structures was higher compared to that in tumors lacking such structures. NAC-treated patients with alveolar and trabecular structures had a high distant metastasis rate and a low metastasis-free survival rate. Furthermore, alveolar and trabecular structures were found to be associated with a lack of response to NAC. Interestingly, the association between alveolar structures and a high distant metastasis rate was found only in NAC-unresponsive patients, whereas the association between trabecular structures and an increased distant metastasis was revealed in responders. Alveolar structures were associated with chemoresistance only in patients with lymph node metastases, whereas trabecular structures were associated with chemoresistance only in patients without lymph node metastases. In general, increased intratumoral morphological diversity correlated with considerable chemoresistance and a high metastasis rate of BC. We found variable expressions of epithelial (EPCAM and CDH1) and mesenchymal (ITGA5, ITGB5, CDH2, CDH11, TGFb2, ZEB1, MMP2, DCN, MST1R) markers and, thus, different EMT manifestations in different morphological structures. Therefore, intratumoral morphological heterogeneity of BC may serve as an indicator of the metastatic potential and tumor chemosensitivity.",

One of the most topical problems in the field of DNA repair is to understand the mechanism of the enzymatic process involving the human enzyme APE1 that provides recognition of AP sites and efficient cleavage of the 5'-phosphodiester bond. In this study, a thermodynamic analysis of the interaction between APE1 and a DNA substrate containing a stable AP site analog lacking the C1' hydroxyl group (F site) was performed. Based on stopped-flow kinetic data at different temperatures, the steps of DNA binding, catalysis, and DNA product release were characterized. The changes in the standard Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy of sequential specific steps of the repair process were determined. The thermodynamic analysis of the data suggests that the initial step of the DNA substrate binding includes formation of non-specific contacts between the enzyme binding surface and DNA, as well as insertion of the amino acid residues Arg177 and Met270 into the duplex, which results in the removal of \"crystalline\" water molecules from DNA grooves. The second binding step involves the F site flipping-out process and formation of specific contacts between the enzyme active site and the everted 5'-phosphate-2'-deoxyribose residue. It was shown that non-specific interactions between the binding surfaces of the enzyme and DNA provide the main contribution into the thermodynamic parameters of the DNA product release step.",

    "abstract": "About 90% of all malignant tumors are of epithelial nature. The epithelial tissue is characterized by a close interconnection between cells through cellcell interactions, as well as a tight connection with the basement membrane, which is responsible for cell polarity. These interactions strictly determine the location of epithelial cells within the body and are seemingly in conflict with the metastatic potential that many cancers possess (the main criteria for highly malignant tumors). Tumor dissemination into vital organs is one of the primary causes of death in patients with cancer. Tumor dissemination is based on the so-called epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), a process when epithelial cells are transformed into mesenchymal cells possessing high mobility and migration potential. More and more studies elucidating the role of the EMT in metastasis and other aspects of tumor progression are published each year, thus forming a promising field of cancer research. In this review, we examine the most recent data on the intracellular and extracellular molecular mechanisms that activate EMT and the role they play in various aspects of tumor progression, such as metastasis, apoptotic resistance, and immune evasion, aspects that have usually been attributed exclusively to cancer stem cells (CSCs). In conclusion, we provide a detailed review of the approved and promising drugs for cancer therapy that target the components of the EMT signaling pathways.",

A water solution of silver nanoparticles (SNP) with particle sizes of 9±6 nm was obtained by means of the original method of biochemical synthesis. The effect of the SNP solution was compared to those of AOT (anionic surfactant used as SNP stabilizer) and silver nitrate (i.e. Ag- ions) introduced as water solutions. In studies of the toxic effects, the death of mice was registered 12-24 hours after injection only at two maximum dozes of SNP (equivalent to 0.54 and 0.36 gAg/l). It is shown that the toxic effect decreases in the sequence SNP>AOT>>AgNO3. The LE50/30 values for SNP and AOT are equal to 0.30±0.07 gAg/l and 13.3±2.1 gAg/l, respectively. Genotoxic effects were assessed by the abnormal sperm heads test and neutral Comet assay. The frequencies of abnormal sperm heads (ASHs) did not differ after treatment by SNP and AOT, but both were significantly higher than those found with AgNO3 and in control mice. Comet assay showed an increase of the DNA percentage in the comet tail in spleen cells after the injection of SNP and AOT in concentrations of ½ LE50/30. Tail DNA % was 32.8±1.3 and 26.3±1.7%, respectively, vs 16.2±0.7% for the untreated control.

Earlier, in the Postovsky Institute of Organic Synthesis, UB RAS, an original method of levofloxacin synthesis was developed, and now the pilot batch of the drug is being prepared.

    "abstract": "A large amount of clinical and experimental data suggest the involvement of neurotrophins, in particular the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in depression pathogenesis. However, the therapeutic use of BDNF is limited because of its instability in biological fluids, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and the presence of side effects. A low-molecular-weight mimetic GSB-106, which is a substituted dimeric dipeptide bis(N-monosuccinyl-L-seryl-L-lysine)hexamethylenediamide, was designed and synthesized based on the BDNF fourth loop structure at the V.V. Zakusov Institute of Pharmacology (RAMS). GSB-106 was found to exhibit an antidepressant activity in various models of depressive-like state when administered intraperitoneally to outbred mice and rats. An effect for the substance, when administered daily for 4-5 days, was detected in the Porsolt forced swimming test (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) and in the tail suspension test in mice (1.0 and 1.5 mg/ kg). An effect for GSB-106 at doses of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg was observed after a single application in experiments on rats in the Nomura water wheel test. The obtained evidence supports the hypothesis on the involvement of BDNF in the pathogenesis of various depression conditions, thus opening prospects for searching for new original antidepressants.",

    "abstract": "Comorbidity or a combination of several diseases in the same individual is a common and widely investigated phenomenon. However, the genetic background for non-random disease combinations is not fully understood. Modern technologies and approaches to genomic data analysis enable the investigation of the genetic profile of patients burdened with several diseases (polypathia, disease conglomerates) and its comparison with the profiles of patients with single diseases. An association study featuring three groups of patients with various combinations of cardiovascular disorders and a control group of relatively healthy individuals was conducted. Patients were selected as follows: presence of only one disease, ischemic heart disease (IHD); a combination of two diseases, IHD and arterial hypertension (AH); and a combination of several diseases, including IHD, AH, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypercholesterolemia (HC). Genotyping was performed using the My Gene genomic service (www.i-gene.ru). An analysis of 1,400 polymorphic genetic variants and their associations with the studied phenotypes are presented. A total of 14 polymorphic variants were associated with the phenotype IHD only, including those in the APOB, CD226, NKX2-5, TLR2, DPP6, KLRB1, VDR, SCARB1, NEDD4L, and SREBF2 genes, and intragenic variants rs12487066, rs7807268, rs10896449, and rs944289. A total of 13 genetic markers were associated with the IHD and AH phenotype, including variants in the BTNL2, EGFR, CNTNAP2, SCARB1, and HNF1A genes, and intragenic polymorphisms rs801114, rs10499194, rs13207033, rs2398162, rs6501455, and rs1160312. A total of 14 genetic variants were associated with a combination of several diseases of cardiovascular continuum (CVC), including those in the TAS2R38, SEZ6L, APOA2, KLF7, CETP, ITGA4, RAD54B, LDLR, and MTAP genes, along with intragenic variants rs1333048, rs1333049, and rs6501455. One common genetic marker was identified for the IHD only and IHD and AH phenotypes: rs4765623 in the SCARB1 gene; two common genetic markers, rs663048 in SEZ6L and intragenic rs6501455, were identified for the IHD and AH phenotype and a combination of several diseases (syntropy); there were no common genetic markers for the syntropy and IHD only phenotypes. Classificatory analysis of the relationships between the associated genes and metabolic pathways revealed that lipid-metabolizing genes are involved in the development of all three CVC variants, whereas immunity-response genes are specific to the IHD only phenotype. The study demonstrated that comorbidity presents additional challenges in association studies of disease predisposition, since the genetic profile of combined forms of pathology can be markedly different from those for isolated single forms of a disease.",

    "abstract": "Human secreted Ly-6/uPAR related proteins (SLURP-1 and SLURP-2) are produced by various cells, including the epithelium and immune system. These proteins act as autocrine/paracrine hormones regulating the growth and differentiation of keratinocytes and are also involved in the control of inflammation and malignant cell transformation. These effects are assumed to be mediated by the interactions of SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 with the 7 and 32 subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), respectively. Available knowledge about the molecular mechanism underling the SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 effects is very limited. SLURP-2 remains one of the most poorly studied proteins of the Ly-6/uPAR family. In this study, we designed for the first time a bacterial system for SLURP-2 expression and a protocol for refolding of the protein from cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Milligram quantities of recombinant SLURP-2 and its 13С-15N-labeled analog were obtained. The recombinant protein was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, and a structural model was developed. A comparative study of the SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 effects on the epithelial cell growth was conducted using human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, which express only 7-nAChRs. A pronounced antiproliferative effect of both proteins was observed. Incubation of cells with 1 M SLURP-1 and 1 M SLURP-2 during 48 h led to a reduction in the cell number down to ~ 54 and 63% relative to the control, respectively. Fluorescent microscopy did not reveal either apoptotic or necrotic cell death. An analysis of the dose-response curve revealed the concentration-dependent mode of the SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 action with EC50 ~ 0.1 and 0.2 nM, respectively. These findings suggest that the 7-nAChR is the main receptor responsible for the antiproliferative effect of SLURP proteins in epithelial cells.",

This approach has enables the suppression of virus replication in the body, which significantly prolongs the life of HIV patients. The main downside of the method is the development of viral resistance to many anti-HIV drugs, which requires the creation of new drugs effective against drug-resistant viral forms. Currently, several fundamentally new approaches to HIV-1 treatment are under development, including the use of neutralizing antibodies, genome editing, and blocking an integrated latent provirus. This review describes a traditional approach involving HIV-1 inhibitors as well as the prospects of other treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of neutrophils play an important role in the animal and human host defenses. We have isolated two AMPs (average molecular masses of 2895.5 and 2739.3 Da), with potent antimicrobial activity from neutrophils of the domestic goat (Capra hircus). A structural analysis of the obtained peptides revealed that they encompass N-terminal fragments (1-21 and 1-22) of the proline-rich peptide bactenecin 7.5. The primary structure of caprine bactenecin 7.5 had been previously deduced from the nucleotide sequence, but the corresponding protein had not been isolated from leukocytes until now. The obtained caprine AMPs were designated as mini-batenecins (mini-ChBac7.5N and mini-ChBac7.5N), analogously to the reported C-terminal fragment of the ovine bactenecin 7.5 named Bac7.5mini [Anderson, Yu, 2003]. Caprine mini-ChBac7.5N and mini-ChBac7.5N exhibit significant antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including drug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter baumannii at a range of concentrations of 0.5-4 M, as well as against some species of Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes EGD, Micrococcus luteus). The eptides demonstrate lipopolysaccharide-binding activity. Similarly to most proline-rich AMPs, caprine peptides inactivate bacteria without appreciable damage of their membranes. Mini-ChBac7.5N and mini-ChBac7.5N have no hemolytic effect on human red blood cells and are nontoxic to various cultured human cells. Therefore, they might be considered as promising templates for the development of novel antibiotic pharmaceuticals. Isolation of highly active fragments of the antimicrobial peptide from goat neutrophils supports the hypothesis that fragmentation of cathelicidin-related AMPs is an important process that results in the generation of potent effector molecules, which are in some cases more active than full-size AMPs. These truncated AMPs may play a crucial role in host defense reactions.",

    "abstract": "The MBD4 enzyme initiates the process of DNA demethylation by the excision of modified DNA bases, resulting in the formation of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites. MBD4 contains a methyl-CpG-binding domain which provides the localization of the enzyme at the CpG sites, and a DNA glycosylase domain that is responsible for the catalytic activity. The aim of this work was to clarify the mechanisms of specific site recognition and formation of catalytically active complexes between model DNA substrates and the catalytic N-glycosylase domain MBD4cat. The conformational changes in MBD4cat and DNA substrates during their interaction were recorded in real time by stopped-flow detection of the fluorescence of tryptophan residues in the enzyme and fluorophores in DNA. A kinetic scheme of MBD4cat interaction with DNA was proposed, and the rate constants for the formation and decomposition of transient reaction intermediates were calculated. Using DNA substrates of different lengths, the formation of the catalytically active complex was shown to follow the primary DNA binding step which is responsible for the search and recognition of the modified base. The results reveal that in the primary complex of MBD4cat with DNA containing modified nucleotides, local melting and bending of the DNA strand occur. On the next step, when the catalytically competent conformation of the enzyme-substrate complex is formed, the modified nucleotide is everted from the double DNA helix into the active center and the void in the helix is filled by the enzyme's amino acids.",

However, along with high immunogenicity, the vaccinia virus (VACV) caused serious side effects in vaccinees, sometimes with lethal outcomes. Therefore, after global eradication of smallpox, VACV vaccination was stopped. For this reason, most of the human population worldwide lacks specific immunity against not only smallpox, but also other zoonotic orthopoxviruses. Outbreaks of diseases caused by these viruses have increasingly occurred in humans on different continents. However, use of the classical live VACV vaccine for prevention against these diseases is unacceptable because of potential serious side effects, especially in individuals with suppressed immunity or immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV-infected patients). Therefore, highly attenuated VACV variants that preserve their immunogenicity are needed. This review discusses current ideas about the development of a humoral and cellular immune response to orthopoxvirus infection/vaccination and describes genetic engineering approaches that could be utilized to generate safe and highly immunogenic live VACV vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown the importance of the human intestinal microbiome in maintaining a healthy gastrointestinal tract, as well as in the development of pathological processes. The intestinal microbiome manifests itself primarily as fecal metabolites. In the past decade, there has been growing interest in studying its composition, which for the most part had to do with the possibility of using the metabolomic analysis in clinical diagnosis. In contrast to the comprehensive description of blood serum, urine, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid metabolites, data on fecal metabolites is sparse. Despite the instrumental and methodological achievements in the metabolomic analysis in general, the analysis of fecal metabolome remains less well developed, mainly because of the inhomogeneity of its composition and the lack of standardized methods for collecting, processing, and analyzing fecal samples. This review summarizes data on methods for studying and describing various groups of fecal metabolites. It also assesses their potential as tools in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Antitumor therapy, including adoptive immunotherapy, inevitably faces powerful counteraction from advanced cancer. If hematological malignancies are currently amenable to therapy with CAR-T lymphocytes (T-cells modified by the chimeric antigen receptor), solid tumors, unfortunately, show a significantly higher degree of resistance to this type of therapy. As recent studies show, the leading role in the escape of solid tumors from the cytotoxic activity of immune cells belongs to the tumor microenvironment (TME). TME consists of several types of cells, including neutrophils, the most numerous cells of the immune system. Recent studies show that the development of the tumor and its ability to metastasize directly affect the extracellular traps of neutrophils (neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs) formed as a result of the response to tumor stimuli. In addition, the nuclear DNA of neutrophils - the main component of NETs - erects a spatial barrier to the interaction of CAR-T with tumor cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the promising potential of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) in the destruction of NETs. In this regard, the use of eukaryotic deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is promising in the effort to increase the efficiency of CAR-T by reducing the NETs influence in TME. We will examine the role of NETs in TME and the various approaches in the effort to reduce the effect of NETs on a tumor.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells capable of long-term proliferation and differentiation into different cell types may be a promising source of cells for regenerative medicine. Recently, much attention has been paid to fetal stem cells, among which are cells from amniotic fluid (AF). We have isolated amniotic stem cells from 3 AF samples. Flow cytometry, RT -PCR and immunohistochemistry have shown that these cells express mesenchymal (CD90, CD73, CD105, CD13, CD29, CD44, and CD146), neural (≤3-tubulin, Nestin, and Pax6), epithelial (keratin 19 and p63) markers and also markers of pluripotency (Oct4, Nanog, and Rex-1). Transplantation of the cells to nude mice does not lead to tumor formation. Thus, putative stem/progenitor cells from AF are capable of long-term proliferation in vitro and the profile of gene expression led us to speculate that they have greater differentiation potential than mesenchymal stem cells and may be useful for cell therapy.",

The interest towards quadruplex DNAs is determined by their involvement in the functioning of telomeres and onco-promoters as well as by the possibility to create on their basis aptamers and nanostructures. Here, we present an algorithm for a general analysis of the polymorphism of the G-quadruplex structure from the data bank PDB using original parameters. 74 structures were grouped according to the following parameters: the number of DNA strands, the number of G-quartets, and the location and orientation of the connecting loops. Two quantitative parameters were used to describe the quadruplex structure: the twist angle between two adjacent quartets (analogous to that for the complementary pair in the duplex DNA) and the quartet planarity (an original parameter). The distribution patterns of these values are specific for each group of quadruplex structures and are dependent upon the type of connecting loops used (diagonal, lateral or propeller). The tetramolecular loopless parallel quadruplex was used as a comparison template. The lateral loops introduce the strongest distortion into the structure of quadruplexes: the values of the twist angles are the lowest and are not typical for the other quadruplex groups. The loops of the diagonal type introduce much weaker deformation into quadruplexes; the structures with propeller loops are characterized by the optimum geometry of G-quartets. Hence, the correlation between the twist angle and the tension in the structure of quadruplex DNA is revealed.",

It regulates several physiological processes, such as stimulation of retinoblastoma cell differentiation into neuron cells, and facilitation of the growth and viability of photoreceptor cells and neurons of the central nervous system. Moreover, this factor protects neuronal cells against apoptosis. PEDF is not only a neurotrophic factor, but also a natural angiogenesis inhibitor. This protein, as well as its biologically active fragments, possesses significant neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and antiangiogenic capabilities. The precise molecular mechanisms underpinning the effects of PEDF are still not quite clear. However, this protein generates great interest as a promising drug for the therapy of a wide range of neurodegenerative, ophthalmological, and oncological diseases.

    "abstract": "The Type III secretion system (T3SS) is currently considered to be one of the main pathogenicity factors in Gram-negative bacteria, which exhibit different types of parasitizing activity. The presence of this structure is essential for the development of an acute infection; the chronicity of the infection is fundamentally dependent upon its functioning. In this regard, T3TS is one of the most promising targets for the development of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs that do not develop resistance and are efficacious for the acute and chronic forms of infection. The mechanism of action in drug development is based on the specific inhibition of T3SS, which should interrupt the infectious process, thereby enabling the immune system to eliminate the pathogen. As a result of pilot screening using specific cellular and bacterial tests, followed by chemical optimization and detailed characterization of the biological activity, a new class of chlamydial T3SS inhibitors was obtained. The selected compounds have obvious advantages over the currently available inhibitors of T3SS pathogens thanks to the high inhibitory activity of these compounds with minimal damaging effects on eukaryotic cells. Preclinical trials of the selected inhibitors are currently under way.",

To date, research effort has routinely focused on studying ligand binding to the functional sites of proteins (active sites of enzymes), whereas the molecular mechanisms of allosteric regulation, as well as binding to other pockets and cavities in protein structures, remained poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that allostery may be an intrinsic property of virtually all proteins. Novel approaches are needed to systematically analyze the architecture and role of various binding sites and establish the relationship between structure, function, and regulation. Computational biology, bioinformatics, and molecular modeling can be used to search for new regulatory centers, characterize their structural peculiarities, as well as compare different pockets in homologous proteins, study the molecular mechanisms of allostery, and understand the communication between topologically independent binding sites in protein structures. The establishment of an evolutionary relationship between different binding centers within protein superfamilies and the discovery of new functional and allosteric (regulatory) sites using computational approaches can improve our understanding of the structure-function relationship in proteins and provide new opportunities for drug design and enzyme engineering.",

Reports on biofilm formation in E. coli K12 showed that the genes participating in AR were differentially expressed. Herein, we investigated the relationship between AR genes, in particular those coding for specific transcriptional regulators, and their biofilm-forming ability at the phenotypic level. The latter was measured in 96-well plates by staining the bacteria attached to the well, following 24-hour growth under static conditions, with crystal violet. The growth conditions were as follows: Luria Bertani (LB) medium at neutral and acidic pH, at 37°C or 25°C. We observed that the three major transcriptional regulators of the AR genes (gadX, gadE, gadW) only marginally affected biofilm formation in E. coli. However, a striking and novel finding was the different abilities of all the tested E. coli strains to form a biofilm depending on the temperature and pH of the medium: LB, pH 7.4, strongly supported biofilm formation at 25°C, with biofilm being hardly detectable at 37°C. On the contrary, LB, pH 5.5, best supported biofilm formation at 37°C. Moreover, we observed that when E. coli carried a plasmid, the presence of the plasmid itself affected the ability to develop a biofilm, typically by increasing its formation. This phenomenon varies from plasmid to plasmid, depends on growth conditions, and, to the best of our knowledge, remains largely uninvestigated.",

The method is based on the spectral correlation interferometry (SCI) that allows real-time measuring of the thickness of a biomolecular layer bound to the recognition molecular receptors on the sensor chip surface. The method is realized with compact 3-channel SCI-biosensors that employ as the sensor chips standard cover glass slips without deposition of any additional films. Different schemes for antibody immobilization on a glass surface have been experimentally compared and optimized toward a higher sorption capacity of the sensor chips. Comparative characterization of the kinetics of each immunoassay stage has been implemented with the optimized protocols: i) covalent immobilization of antibody on an epoxylated surface and ii) biotinylated antibody sorption on a biotinylated surface via a high-affinity biotin-streptavidin bond. We have shown that magnetic nanoparticles employed as labels with model detection of cardiac troponin I further amplify the SCI signal, resulting in 100-fold improvement of the detection limit. The developed protocols can also be used with the alternative immunoassay platforms, including the label methods based on registration of only the final assay result, which is the quantity of bound labels.",

A rare recessive form of the disease may be caused by a mutation in the PARK2 gene, whose product, Parkin, controls mitophagy and programmed cell death. The level of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors of the Bcl-2 family was determined in dopaminergic neurons derived from the induced pluripotent stem cells of a healthy donor and a Parkinson's disease patient bearing PARK2 mutations. Western blotting was used to study the ratios of Bax, Bak, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-W proteins. The pro-apoptotic Bak protein level in PARK2-neurons was shown to be two times lower than that in healthy cells. In contrast, the expression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and Bcl-2 was statistically significantly higher in the mutant cells compared to healthy dopaminergic neurons. These results indicate that PARK2 mutations are accompanied by an imbalance in programmed cell death systems in which non-apoptotic molecular mechanisms play the leading role.",

We have isolated and studied a set of antimicrobial peptides from leukocytes of the Russian sturgeon Acipenser gueldenstaedtii belonging to a subclass of chondrosteans, an ancient group of bony fish. Structural analysis of the isolated peptides, designated as acipensins (Ac), revealed in leukocytes of the Russian sturgeon six novel peptides with molecular masses of 5336.2 Da, 3803.0 Da, 5173.0 Da, 4777.5 Da, 5449.4 Da, and 2740.2 Da, designated as Ac1-Ac6, respectively. Complete primary structures of all the isolated peptides were determined, and the biological activities of three major components - Ac1, Ac2, and Ac6 - were examined. The peptides Ас1, Ас2, Ас3, Ас4, and Ac5 were found to be the N-terminal acetylated fragments 1-50, 1-35, 1-49, 1-44, and 1-51 of the histone Н2А, respectively, while Ас6 was shown to be the 62-85 fragment of the histone Н2А. The peptides Ac1 and Ac2 displayed potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Escherichia coli ML35p, Listeria monocytogenes EGD, MRSA ATCC 33591) and the fungus Candida albicans 820, while Ac6 proved effective only against Gram-negative bacteria. The efficacy of Ac 1 and Ac2 towards the fungus and MRSA was reduced upon an increase in the ionic strength of the solution. Ac1, Ac2, and Ac6, at concentrations close to their minimum inhibitory concentrations, enhanced the permeability of the E.coli ML35p outer membrane to the chromogenic marker, but they did not affect appreciably the permeability of the bacterial inner membrane in comparison with a potent pore-forming peptide, protegrin 1. Ac1, Ac2, and Ac6 revealed no hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes at concentrations of 1 to 40 M and had no cytotoxic effect (1 to 20 M) on K-562 and U-937 cells in vitro. Our findings suggest that histone-derived peptides serve as important anti-infective host defense molecules.",

Already , DC-based antitumor vaccines have been thoroughly explored both in animal tumor models and in clinical trials. DC-based vaccines are commonly produced from DC progenitors isolated from peripheral blood or bone marrow by culturing in the presence of cytokines, followed by loading the DCs with tumor-specific antigens, such as DNA, RNA, viral vectors, or a tumor cell lysate. However, the efficacy of DC-based vaccines remains low. Undoubtedly, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which DCs function would allow us to enhance the antitumor efficacy of DC-based vaccines in clinical applications.

According to modern concepts, the impairment of trophoblast invasion into maternal spiral arteries, leading to the development of ischemia in placenta, is considered to be the major pathogenetic factor of PE development. Ischemic lesions initiate the development of a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) and endothelial dysfunction, which is the main cause of the multiple organ failure in PE. Some data has appear indicating the importance of a glycans-forming endothelial glycocalyx and extracellular matrix (ECM) for placenta morphogenesis, as well as their role in the regulation of vascular permeability and vascular tone in hypertension disorders and, in particular, PE. Since intact glycocalyx and ECM are considered to be the major factors that maintain the physiological vascular tone and adequate intercellular interactions, their value in PE pathogenesis is underestimated. This review is focused on hyaluronic acid (HA) as the key glycan providing the organization and stabilization of the ECM and glycocalyx, its distribution in tissues in the case of presence or absence of placental pathology, as well as on the regulatory function of hyaluronic acids of various molecular weights in different physiological and pathophysiological processes. The summarized data will provide a better understanding of the PE pathogenesis, with the main focus on glycopathology.",

In addition, we discuss the DR4 and DR5 agonistic antibodies that are being evaluated at various stages of clinical trials. Finally, we conclude by stating that death receptor agonists may be improved through increasing their stability, solubility, and elimination half-life, as well as by overcoming the resistance of tumor cells.

    "abstract": "Lipid-protein nanodiscs (LPNs) are nanoscaled fragments of a lipid bilayer stabilized in solution by the apolipoprotein or a special membrane scaffold protein (MSP). In this work, the applicability of LPN-based membrane mimetics in the investigation of water-soluble membrane-active peptides was studied. It was shown that a pore-forming antimicrobial peptide arenicin-2 from marine lugworm (charge of +6) disintegrates LPNs containing both zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) and anionic phosphatidylglycerol (PG) lipids. In contrast, the spider toxin VSTx1 (charge of +3), a modifier of Kv channel gating, effectively binds to the LPNs containing anionic lipids (POPC/DOPG, 3 : 1) and does not cause their disruption. VSTx1 has a lower affinity to LPNs containing zwitterionic lipids (POPC), and it weakly interacts with the protein component of nanodiscs, MSP (charge of -6). The neurotoxin II (NTII, charge of +4) from cobra venom, an inhibitor of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, shows a comparatively low affinity to LPNs containing anionic lipids (POPC/DOPG, 3 : 1 or POPC/DOPS, 4 : 1), and it does not bind to LPNs/POPC. The obtained data show that NTII interacts with the LPN/POPC/DOPS surface in several orientations, and that the exchange process among complexes with different topologies proceeds fast on the NMR timescale. Only one of the possible NTII orientations allows for the previously proposed specific interaction between the toxin and the polar head group of phosphatidylserine from the receptor environment (Lesovoy et al., Biophys. J. 2009. V. 97. № 7. P. 2089-2097). These results indicate that LPNs can be used in structural and functional studies of water-soluble membrane-active peptides (probably except pore-forming ones) and in studies of the molecular mechanisms of peptide-membrane interaction.",

    "abstract": "Genomic diseases or syndromes with multiple manifestations arise spontaneously and unpredictably as a result of contiguous deletions and duplications generated by unequal recombination in chromosomal regions with a specific architecture. The Williams syndrome is believed to be one of the most attractive models for linking genes, the brain, behavior and cognitive functions. It is a neurogenetic disorder resulting from a 1.5 Mb deletion at 7q11.23 which covers more than 20 genes; the hemizigosity of these genes leads to multiple manifestations, with the behavioral ones comprising three distinct domains: 1) visuo-spatial orientation; 2) verbal and linguistic defect; and 3) hypersocialisation. The shortest observed deletion leads to hemizigosity in only two genes: eln and limk1. Therefore, the first gene is supposed to be responsible for cardiovascular pathology; and the second one, for cognitive pathology. Since cognitive pathology diminishes with a patients age, the original idea of the crucial role of genes straightforwardly determining the brains morphology and behavior was substituted by ideas of the brains plasticity and the necessity of finding epigenetic factors that affect brain development and the functions manifested as behavioral changes. Recently, non-coding microRNAs (miRs) began to be considered as the main players in these epigenetic events. This review tackles the following problems: is it possible to develop relatively simple model systems to analyze the contribution of both a single gene and the consequences of its epigenetic regulation in the formation of the Williams syndromes cognitive phenotype? Is it possible to use Drosophila as a simple model system?",

Chemoreception systems are found in organisms belonging to all biological kingdoms. In higher multicellular animals, chemoreception (along with photo- and mechanoreception) underlies the functioning of five traditional senses. Insects have developed a peculiar and one of the most sophisticated chemoreception systems, which exploits at least three receptor superfamilies providing perception of smell and taste, as well as chemical communication in these animals. The enormous diversity of physiologically relevant compounds in the environment has given rise to a wide-ranging repertoire of chemoreceptors of various specificities. Thus, in insects, they are represented by several structurally and functionally distinct protein classes and are encoded by hundreds of genes. In the current review, we briefly characterize the insect chemoreception system by describing the main groups of receptors that constitute it and putting emphasis on the peculiar architecture and mechanisms of functioning possessed by these molecules.",

The nuclei of a muscle fiber (myonuclei) are those located at the periphery of fiber in the space between myofibrils and sarcolemma. In theory, a mass change in skeletal muscle during exercise or unloading may be associated with the altered myonuclear number, ratio of the transcription, and translation and proteolysis rates. Here we review the literature data related to the phenomenology and hypothetical mechanisms of the myonuclear number alterations during enhanced or reduced muscle contractile activity. In many cases (during severe muscle and systemic diseases and gravitational unloading), muscle atrophy is accompanied by a reduction in the amount of myonuclei. Such reduction is usually explained by the development of myonuclear apoptosis. A myonuclear number increase may be provided only by the satellite cell nuclei incorporation via cell fusion with the adjacent myofiber. It is believed that it is these cells which supply fiber with additional nuclei, providing postnatal growth, work hypertrophy, and repair processes. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms controlling satellite cell proliferation during exercise, functional unloading, and passive stretch.",

These viral vectors were constructed on the basis of the potato virus X (PVX) genome and Alternanthera mosaic virus (AltMV) CP gene. The expression, based on the hybrid viral vectors, is genetically safe, since the systemic transport and formation of infective viral particles are blocked. CP AltMV can self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) in the absence of genomic RNA. The vectors can be used for the presentation of foreign peptides (including epitopes of human pathogens) on the surface of the VLP. The N-terminal extracellular domain (M2e) of the influenza virus A M2 protein and its truncated variant (ΔM2e) were used as model heterologous peptides for the construction of the chimeric CP AltMV. Chimeric CP AltMV retains its ability to self-assemble into VLP. The epitopes of the M2 influenza virus protein were not eliminated during the process of accumulation, polymerization and purification of chimeric VLP AltMV, providing evidence of the stability of chimeric VLP with C-terminal heterologous epitopes. It appears that VLP produced by the vectors PVX-CP AltMV and PVXdt-CP AltMV can be used in the field of biotechnology for the presentation of the epitopes of vaccine proteins on their surfaces.

This study was aimed at elucidating the role of the protein factors that promote aggregate formation or prevent the process, respectively, glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and Hsp70 molecular chaperone. The siRNA technology was used to show that the inhibition of GAPDH expression leads to a 4550% reduction in the aggregation of mutant huntingtin, with a repeat of 103 glutamine residues in a model of Huntingtons disease (HD). Similarly, the blockage of GAPDH synthesis was found for the first time to reduce the degree of aggregation of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (G93A) in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The treatment of cells that imitate HD and ALS with a pharmacological GAPDH inhibitor, hydroxynonenal, was also shown to reduce the amount of the aggregating material in both disease models. Tissue transglutaminase is another factor that promotes the aggregation of mutant proteins; the inhibition of its activity with cystamine was found to prevent aggregate formation of mutant huntingtin and SOD1. In order to explore the protective function of Hsp70 in the control of the aggregation of mutant huntingtin, a cell model with inducible expression of the chaperone was used. The amount and size of polyglutamine aggregates were reduced by increasing the intracellular content of Hsp70. Thus, pharmacological regulation of the function of three proteins, GAPDH, tTG, and Hsp70, can affect the pathogenesis of two significant neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has the ability to evade the adaptive immune response due to high mutation rates. Soon after the discovery of HIV-1, it was originally proposed that neutralizing of antibodies to the virus occurs rarely or cannot be elicited at all. In the 1990s, there appeared reports that sera of select HIV-1-infected individuals contained antibodies capable of neutralizing different virus subtypes. Such antibodies were named broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Since 2009, the development of new cell technologies has intensified research efforts directed at identifying new bNAbs with a neutralization potency of over 90% of primary HIV-1 isolates. These antibodies have unique characteristics which include high levels of somatic mutations and unusually long variable loops that penetrate through the glycan shield of HIV-1 Env to contact the protein surface. In this review, we will attempt to summarize the latest data on bNAbs against HIV-1 in terms of their interactions with the sites of vulnerability on HIV-1 glycoproteins.",

    "abstract": "Involvement of BDNF in the regulation of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus, impairment of which underlies the pathophysiology of depression, makes this endogenous protein a promising object for the development of new-generation antidepressants with a neurophysiologically based mechanism of action. A low-molecular-weight BDNF mimetic, GSB-106 (a substituted dimeric dipeptide, bis-(N-monosuccinyl- L-seryl-L-lysine) hexamethylenediamide), was designed and synthesized at the Zakusov Institute of Pharmacology. GSB-106 was found to activate BDNF-specific TrkB receptors and their main post-receptor signaling pathways MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT. GSB-106 exhibited pronounced antidepressant activity in a rodent test battery at a dose of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally. Because oral administration is preferable in the treatment of depression, which is associated with a prolonged duration and outpatient character of pharmacotherapy, we examined the antidepressant properties of GSB-106 administered orally as a pharmaceutical substance (PS) and in tablet dosage form (TDF). In the study, we used the Porsolt forced swim test in rats; a conventional antidepressant, Amitriptyline, was used as a reference drug. The antidepressant activity of GSB-106 was found to retain upon oral administration and to manifest at doses of 0.5-5.0 mg/kg for PS and 0.01-5.0 mg/kg for TDF. The effective dose of TDF was 50-fold lower than that of PS, and the efficacy of tableted GSB-106 exceeded that of Amitriptyline, the gold standard in antidepression care. Therefore, GSB-106, both as a substance and as a tablet dosage form, exhibits antidepressant activity when administered orally, which makes it a promising antidepressant agent, the first in the class of BDNF mimetics.",

Unlike other members of the family, PON2 exhibits substantial antioxidant activity, is localized predominantly inside the cell, and is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues. Previously, it was proffered that defense against pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is the main function of paraoxonases. However, recent findings have highlighted the important role played by PON2 in protection against oxidative stress, inhibition of apoptosis, and progression of various types of malignancies. In the current study, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of RNA and DNA sequencing data extracted from tumor samples taken from more than 10,000 patients with 31 different types of cancer and determined expression levels and mutations in the PON2 gene. Next, we investigated the intracellular localization of PON2 in multiple cancer cell lines and identified the proteins interacting with PON2 using the LC-MS/MS technique. Our data indicate that a high PON2 expression level correlates with a worse prognosis for patients with multiple types of solid tumors and suggest that PON2, when localized on the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum, may protect cancer cells against unfavorable environmental conditions and chemotherapy.",

Norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations in the tear fluid of patients were found to increase compared to those in age controls, which was especially pronounced on the side where motor symptoms appeared. On the contrary, the epinephrine concentration in the tear fluid of patients was reduced bilaterally. Since there was no reason to consider the markers found in the clinical stage of PD as markers of the preclinical stage, we additionally studied the tear fluid composition in mouse neurotoxic models of PD preclinical and clinical stages. The norepinephrine concentration in the tear fluid of mice from the clinical stage model was found to be higher than that in controls; in the preclinical stage model, the norepinephrine concentration had a tendency to increase. Therefore, both PD patients and mice from PD preclinical and clinical stage models manifest unidirectional changes in their tear fluid compositions, which may be considered as promising biomarkers for the development of early diagnosis.",

Dipole modifiers, flavonoids and styryl dyes, were used as a tool to study the molecular mechanisms of polyene channel-forming activity. The introduction of dipole modifiers into the membrane bathing solutions was shown to change the conductance of single channels and the steadystate transmembrane current induced by polyene antibiotics in the sterol-containing phospholipid-bilayers. The conductance of single amphotericin B channels was found to depend on the dipole potential of the membrane. The experiments with various phospholipids, sterols, and polyenes led to the assumption that the shape of a phospholipid molecule, the presence of double bonds at the positions 7 and 22 of a sterol molecule, the number of conjugated double bonds, and the presence of an amino sugar in the polyene antibiotic molecule are important factors impacting the stability of polyene-lipid complexes forming ion-permeable pores. Experimental and literature data presented in the paper suggest that the channel-forming activity of polyene antibiotics is also affected by the physicochemical properties of polyene-enriched ordered membrane domains.",

Developed biotechnological approaches were based on earlier fundamental researches into anaerobic stress in plants, so Introduction briefly covers the importance of the problem and focuses on works considering two main strategies of plants adaptation to anaerobic stress. Those are adaptation at molecular level where key factor is anaerobic metabolism of energy (true tolerance) and adaptation of the entire plant via formation of aerenchyma and facilitated transportation of oxygen (apparent tolerance). Thus, sugarcane and wheat cells resistant to anaerobic stress were obtained through consecutive in vitro selection under conditions of anoxia and absence of exogenous carbohydrates. Tolerant wheat cells were used to regenerate entire plants of higher resistance to root anaerobiosis. It has been demonstrated that cells tolerance to anoxia is significantly supported by their ability to utilize exogenous nitrate. Cells tolerance established itself at the genetic level and was inherited by further generations. Apart from that, other successful attempts to increase tolerance of plants to anaerobic stress by means of stimulation of glycolysis and overexpression of genes responsible for cytokinin synthesis and programmed cell death are also discussed. The presented data proved the notion of two main strategies of plants adaptation to anaerobic stress proposed earlier on the base of fundamental studies.",

Both genetic and epigenetic factors, including microRNAs (miRNAs), are involved in MDS development. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that are important regulators of normal hematopoiesis, and abnormal changes in their expression levels can contribute to hematological tumor development. To assess the prognosis of the disease, an international assessment system taking into account a karyotype, the number of blast cells, and the degree of deficiency of different blood cell types is used. However, the overall survival and effectiveness of the therapy offered are not always consistent with predictions. The search for new biomarkers, followed by their integration into the existing prognostic system, will allow for personalized treatment to be performed with more precision.

The review also discusses the osteogenic cell's pathways of signal transduction and the mechanisms of gravitational sensitivity. It was shown, that the earliest multipotent stromal precursor cells of an adult organism's bone marrow can sense changes of intensity in a gravitational or mechanic field in model conditions, which may play a certain role in the development of osteopenia in microgravity.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed the gene expression profile under specific conditions during reversible transition of M. tuberculosis cells to the \"non-culturable\" (NC ) state in a prolonged stationary phase. More than 500 genes were differentially regulated, while 238 genes were upregulated over all time points during NC cell formation. Approximately a quarter of these upregulated genes belong to insertion and phage sequences indicating a possible high intensity of genome modification processes taking place under transition to the NC state. Besides the high proportion of hypothetical/conserved hypothetical genes in the cohort of upregulated genes, there was a significant number of genes belonging to intermediary metabolism, respiration, information pathways, cell wall and cell processes, and genes encoding regulatory proteins. We conclude that NC cell formation is an active process involved in the regulation of many genes of different pathways. A more detailed analysis of the experimental data will help to understand the precise molecular mechanisms of dormancy/latency/persistence of M. tuberculosis in the future. The list of upregulated genes obtained in this study includes many genes found to be upregulated in other models of M. tuberculosis persistence. Thirteen upregulated genes, which are common for different models, can be considered as potential targets for the development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs directed mainly against latent tuberculosis.",

In the excess of hydrogen peroxide, the decrease in enzyme activity follows first-order kinetics. Therefore, the first-order effective inactivation kinetic constants determined for various FDH forms at a constant H 2O 2 concentration can be used as a quantitative measure of the enzyme stability. It was shown that two cysteine residues located in the active site formate- and coenzyme-binding domains (Cysl45 and Cys255, respectively) make similar contributions to the enzyme stability, while the contribution of Cys354 is insignificant. The inactivation kinetics of wild-type PseFDH, mutant PseFDH Cysl45Ser/Cys255Ala, and FDH produced under stress conditions by bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, higher plants Arabidopsis thaliana, and soya Glycine max, was studied. It was found that the stress-induced FDHs are at least 20 times more stable than the nonstress-induced PseFDH from Pseudomonas sp. 101 grown on methanol.",

Two mouse strains differing in their susceptibility to tuberculosis were used for experimental infection with M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterial transcriptomes obtained from the infected tissues of the mice at two different time points were analyzed by deep sequencing and compared. It was hypothesized that the changes in the M. tuberculosis transcriptome may attest to the activation of the metabolism of lipids and amino acids, transition to anaerobic respiration, and increased expression of the factors modulating the immune response. A total of 209 genes were determined whose expression increased with disease progression in both host strains (commonly upregulated genes, CUG). Among them, the genes related to the functional categories of lipid metabolism, cell wall, and cell processes are of great interest. It was assumed that the products of these genes are involved in M. tuberculosis adaptation to the host immune system defense, thus being potential targets for drug development.",

Mutations in this protein, including Gly380Arg or Ala391Glu substitutions in the transmembrane (TM) region, can cause different disorders in bone development. The determination of the spatial structure of the FGFR3 TM domain in a normal protein and in a protein with single Gly380Arg and Ala391Glu mutations is essential in order to understand the mechanisms that control dimerization and signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases. The effective system of expression of eukaryotic genes in bacteria and the purification protocol for the production of milligram amounts of both normal TM fragments of FGFR3 and those with single pathogenic mutations Gly380Arg and Ala391Glu, as well as their(15)N- and [(15)N,(13)C]-isotope-labelled derivatives, were described. Each peptide was produced inEscherichia coliBL21(DE3)pLysS cells as a C-terminal extension of thioredoxin A. The purification protocol involved immobilized metal affinity chromatography and cation- and anion-exchange chromatography, as well as the fusion protein cleavage with the light subunit of human enterokinase. The efficiency of the incorporation of target peptides into DPC/SDS and DPC/DPG micelles was confirmed using NMR spectroscopy. The described methodology of production of the native FGFR3 TM domain in norma and with single Gly380Arg and Ala391Glu mutations enables one to study their spatial structure using high-resolution heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor PTEN controls multiple cellular functions, including cell cycle, apoptosis, senescence, transcription, and mRNA translation of numerous genes. In tumor cells, PTEN is frequently inactivated by genetic mutations and epimutations. The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation patterns of the PTEN gene and its pseudogene PTENP1 as potential genetic markers of endometrial hyperplasia (EH) and endometrial carcinoma (EC). Methylation of the 5'-terminal regions of the PTEN and PTENP1 sequences was studied using methyl-sensitive PCR of genomic DNA isolated from 57 cancer, 43 endometrial hyperplasia, and normal tissue samples of 24 females aged 17-34 years and 19 females aged 45-65 years, as well as 20 peripheral venous blood samples of EC patients. None of the analyzed DNA samples carried a methylated PTEN gene. On the contrary, the PTENP1 pseudogene was methylated in all analyzed tissues, except for the peripheral blood. Comparison of PTENP1 methylation rates revealed no differences between the EC and EH groups (0.80 < p < 0.50). In all these groups, the methylation level was high (71-77% in patients vs. 58% in controls). Differences in PTENP1 methylation rates between normal endometrium in young (4%) and middle-aged and elderly (58%) females were significant (p < 0.001). These findings suggest that PTENP1 pseudogene methylation may reflect age-related changes in the body and is not directly related to the endometrium pathology under study. It is assumed that, depending on the influence of a methylated PTENP1 pseudogene on PTEN gene expression, the pseudogene methylation may protect against the development of EC and/or serve as a marker of a precancerous condition of endometrial cells.",

For at least 80% of its lifespan, this animal shows no signs of aging or any increased likelihood of death and retains the ability to reproduce. The naked mole-rat draws the heightened attention of researchers who study the molecular basis of lengthy lifespan and cancer resistance.

Replicative senescence in the somatic cells of naked mole-rats is missing, while an additional p53/pRb-dependent mechanism of early contact inhibition has been revealed in its fibroblasts, which controls cell proliferation and its mechanism of arf-dependent aging. The unique traits of phenotypic and molecular adaptations found in the naked mole-rat speak to a high stability and effective functioning of the molecular machinery that counteract damage accumulation in its genome.

The widespread application of RNA interference is made difficult because of the imperfections of the methods used for efficient target cell delivery of whatever genes are under study. One of the most convenient and efficient gene transfer and expression systems is based on the use of lentiviral vectors, which direct the synthesis of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), the precursors of siRNAs. The application of these systems enables one to achieve sustainable and long-term shRNA expression in cells. This review considers the adaptation of the processing of artificial shRNA to the mechanisms used by cellular microRNAs and simultaneous expression of several shRNAs as potential approaches for producing lentiviral vectors that direct shRNA synthesis. Approaches to using RNA interference for the treatment of cancer, as well as hereditary and viral diseases, are under active development today. The improvement made to the methods for constructing lentiviral vectors and the investigation into the mechanisms of processing of small interfering RNA allow one to now consider lentiviral vectors that direct shRNA synthesis as one of the most promising tools for delivering small interfering RNAs.",

That GK-2 possesses neuroprotective activity has been observed in various models of cerebral ischemia. GK-2 was found to statistically significantly reduce the cerebral infarct volume in experimental stroke, even at treatment onset 24 h after injury. This suggests that GK-2 possesses neuroregenerative properties, which may be associated with the activation of neurogenesis and/or synaptogenesis. We studied the effect of GK-2 on neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in experimental ischemic stroke caused by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats. GK-2 was administered 6 or 24 h after surgery and then once a day for 7 days. One day after the last administration, proliferative activity in the hippocampus and striatum of the affected hemisphere was assessed using Ki67 and synaptogenesis in the striatum was evaluated using synaptophysin and PSD-95. Ki67 immunoreactivity, both in the striatum and in the hippocampus of the ischemic rats, was found to have dropped by approximately 30% compared to that in the sham-operated controls. Synaptic markers - synaptophysin and PSD-95 - were also statistically significantly reduced, by 14 and 29%, respectively. GK-2 in both administration schedules completely restored the level of Ki67 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and promoted its increase in the striatum. In addition, GK-2 restored the level of the postsynaptic marker PSD-95, with the therapeutic effect amounting to 70% at the start of its administration after 6 h, and promoted restoration of the level of this marker at the start of administration 24 h after an experimental stroke. GK-2 had no effect on the synaptophysin level. These findings suggest that the neurotrophin mimetic GK-2, which mainly activates one of the main Trk receptor signaling pathways PI3K/ AKT, has a stimulating effect on neurogenesis (and, probably, gliogenesis) and synaptogenesis in experimental cerebral ischemia. This effect may explain the protective effect observed at the start of dipeptide administration 24 h after stroke simulation.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family play an important role in the realization of the protective functions of innate immunity and are the key mediators involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases, including various manifestations of allergy. The IL-1 family includes more than 11 members. However, the functions of many of them remain to be elucidated. Recently, new members of the IL-1 family have been discovered. In 2000, several independent research groups reported the discovery of a new interleukin of this family, which was named IL-37, or IL-1F7 (according to the new nomenclature). IL-37 was assigned to the IL-1 family based on its structural similarity with other members of this family. The study of its biological properties showed that its activity changes in inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, as well as allergic diseases (allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and atopic dermatitis). However, unlike most members of the IL-1 family, IL-37 acts as a negative regulator of inflammation. Activation of IL-37 suppresses inflammation, resulting in the suppression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which in turn prevents infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells, mainly eosinophils and neutrophils. The exact molecular and cellular mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect of IL-37 in the development of allergic diseases (AD) have not been fully studied. This review summarizes and analyzes the accumulated experimental data on the role of IL-37 in the pathogenesis of AD, such as allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and atopic dermatitis.",

    "abstract": "The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is a key part of the transcription complex of RNA polymerase II. Alone or as a part of the basal transcription factor TFIID, TBP binds the TATA box located in the core region of the TATA-containing promoters of class II genes. Previously, we studied the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on TBP/TATA-box interactions using gel retardation assay. It was demonstrated that most SNPs in the TATA boxes of some human gene promoters cause a 2- to 4-fold decrease in TBP/TATA affinity, which is associated with an increased risk of hereditary diseases, such as β thalassemias of diverse severity, hemophilia B Leyden, myocardial infarction, thrombophlebitis, lung cancer, etc. In this work, the process of TBP/TATA complex formation has been studied in real time by a stopped-flow technique using recombinant human TBP and duplexes, which were identical to the TATA box of the wild-type and a SNP-containing triosephosphate isomerase gene promoter and were fluorescently labeled by the Cy3/Cy5 FRET pair. It has been demonstrated for the first time that real-time binding of TBP to the TATA box of the TPI gene promoter is complete within 10 s and is described by a single-stage kinetic model. The complex formation of TBP with the wild-type TATA box occurs 5.5 times faster and the complex dissociation occurs 31 times slower compared with the SNPcontaining TATA box. Within the first seconds of the interaction, TBP binds to and simultaneously bends the TATA box. Importantly, the TATA box of the wild-type TPI gene promoter requires lower TBP concentrations compared to the TATA box containing the -24T → G SNP, which is associated with neurological and muscular disorders, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases.",

Noopept (10 μM) was shown to increase the DNA-binding activity of HIF-1 only, while lacking the ability to affect that of CREB, NFAT, NF-κB, p53, STAT1, GAS, VDR, and HSF1. Noopept provoked an additional increase in the DNA-binding activity of HIF-1 when applied in conditions of CoCl2-induced HIF- 1 stabilization. The degree of this HIF-positive effect of Noopept was shown to be concentration-dependent. Piracetam (1 mM) failed to affect significantly any of the TF under study. The results of molecular docking showed that Noopept (L-isomer), as well as its metabolite, L-isomer of N-phenyl-acetylprolyl, unlike its pharmacologically ineffective D-isomer, is able to bind to the active site of prolyl hydroxylase 2. Taking into account the important role of the genes activated by HIF-1 in the formation of an adaptive response to hypoxia, data on the ability of Noopept to provoke a selective increase in the DNA-binding activity of HIF-1 explain the wide spectrum of neurochemical and pharmacological effects of Noopept revealed before. The obtained data allow one to propose the HIF-positive effect as the primary mechanism of the activity of this Pro-Gly-containing dipeptide.",

The main reason for the increased interest is the processes of freshwater adaptation taking place in natural populations of this species. Freshwater three-spined stickleback populations form when marine water three-spined sticklebacks fish start spending their entire lifecycle in freshwater lakes and streams. To boot, these freshwater populations acquire novel biological traits during their adaptation to a freshwater environment. The processes taking place in these populations are of great interest to evolutionary biologists. Here, we present differential gene expression profiling in G. aculeatus gills, which was performed in marine and freshwater populations of sticklebacks. In total, 2,982 differentially expressed genes between marine and freshwater populations were discovered. We assumed that differentially expressed genes were distributed not randomly along stickleback chromosomes and that they are regularly observed in the \"divergence islands\" that are responsible for stickleback freshwater adaptation.",

We cloned the ribokinase gene from Thermus sp. 2.9, as well as two different genes of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRPP-synthetase) and the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APR-transferase) gene from Thermus thermophilus HB27 into expression vectors, generated high-yield E. coli producer strains, developed methods for the purification of the enzymes, and investigated enzyme substrate specificity. The enzymes were used for the conversion of D-pentoses into 5-phosphates that were further converted into 5-phospho--D-pentofuranose 1-pyrophosphates by means of ribokinase and PRPP-synthetases. Target nucleotides were obtained through the condensation of the pyrophosphates with adenine and its derivatives in a reaction catalyzed by APR-transferase. 2-Chloro- and 2-fluoroadenosine monophosphates were synthesized from D-ribose and appropriate heterobases in one pot using a system of thermophilic enzymes in the presence of ATP, ribokinase, PRPP-synthetase, and APR-transferase.",

The two PHD-finger domains within a DPF form a single structure that interacts with the modification of the N-terminal histone fragment in a way different from that for single PHD fingers. Several histone modifications interacting with the DPF domain have already been identified. They include acetylation of H3K14 and H3K9, as well as crotonylation of H3K14. These modifications are found predominantly in transcriptionally active chromatin. Proteins containing DPF belong to two classes of protein complexes, which are the transcriptional coactivators involved in the regulation of the chromatin structure. These are the histone acetyltransferase complex belonging to the MYST family and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. The DPF domain is responsible for the specificity of the interactions between these complexes and chromatin. Proteins containing DPF play a crucial role in the activation of the transcription of a number of genes expressed during the development of an organism. These genes are important in the differentiation and malignant transformation of mammalian cells.",

The haplotype analysis of chromosomes with the c.35delG mutation in patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (N=112) and in population samples (N =358) permitted the reconstruction of an ancestral haplotype with this mutation, established the common origin of the majority of the studied mutant chromosomes, and provided the estimated time of the c.35delG mutation carriers expansion (11,800 years) on the territory of the Volga-Ural region.",

Significant association with MI was observed in carriage frequencies of the alleleTGFB1*-509T (p=0.046, OR =1.45, 95% CI: 1.02-2.06), genotypes TGFB1*869T/T (p=0.0024, OR =1.75, 95% CI: 1.22-2.51), andTGFB1*915G/G (p=0.048, OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.05-2.97). Linkage disequilibrium analysis for these SNPs has shown that the associations revealed can be considered to be independent. A complex analysis of MI association with combinations of alleles/genotypes of said SNPs indicates their cumulative effect. An analysis of susceptibility to early-onset MI (≤ 50 years old) revealed a positive association of the alleleTGFB1*-509T (p=0.002, OR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.35-3.71) and genotypeTGFB1*869T/T (p=0.008, OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.18-3.15), as well as their additivity. An analysis of susceptibility to recurrent MI revealed an association of the genotypeTGFB1*-509T/T (p=0.0078, OR=2.60, 95% CI: 1.28-5.28). The results obtained indicate the important role of theTGFB1gene in susceptibility to MI, including early-onset and recurrent MI, in Russians.",

However, it remains difficult to distinguish these bacteria at the intra- and inter-species level. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a member of the B. cereus group. In this work, we studied the inter-species structure of five entomopathogenic strains and 20 isolates of Bt, which were collected from different geo-ecological regions of Ukraine, using various methods: physiological and biochemical analyses, analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA and gyrB genes, by AP-PCR (BOX and ERIC), and by saAFLP. The analysis of the 16S rRNA and gyrB genes revealed the existence of six subgroups within the B. cereus group: B anthracis, B. cereus I and II, Bt I and II, and Bt III, and confirmed that these isolates belong to the genus Bacillus. All strains were subdivided into 3 groups. Seventeen strains belong to the group Bt II of commercial, industrial strains. The AP-PCR (BOX and ERIC) and saAFLP results were in good agreement and with the results obtained for the 16S rRNA and gyrB genes. Based on the derived patterns, all strains were reliably combined into 5 groups. Interestingly, a specific pattern was revealed by the saAFLP analysis for the industrial strain Bt 0376 р.о., which is used to produce the entomopathogenic preparation STAR-t.",

In addition to the well-studied Toll-like receptors, pathogens can be recognized by the receptors belonging to the other PRR families; including NOD-like receptors (NLR). Stimulation of members of NOD-like receptors (NOD1, 2) and Toll-like receptors results in the activation of the transcriptional factor NF-kB regulating gene expression in numerous molecules implicated in the development of proinflammatory reactions. As opposed to Toll-like receptors, the NF-kB-activating ability of NLRs has not been fully studied. In this work, we examine the ability of one member of the NLR family - NOD1 - to activate the main proinflammatory transcriptional factor NF-kB.

    "abstract": "Nucleolus is the major structural domain of the cell nucleus, which in addition to proteins contains ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at different stages of maturation (or pre-rRNA). In mammals, the onset of mitosis is accompanied by the inhibition of rRNA synthesis, nucleolus disassembly, and the migration of pre-rRNA to the cytoplasm. However, the precise role of cytoplasmic pre-rRNA in mitosis remains unclear, and no comparative analysis of its different forms at consequent mitotic stages has thus far been performed. The focus of this research was the study of the localization of pre-rRNA in mitotic NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes to several regions of mouse primary 47S pre-rRNA transcripts and by confocal laser microscopy. The results reveal that all types of pre-rRNA appear in the cytoplasm at the beginning of mitosis, following the breakdown of the nucleolus and nuclear envelope. However, not all pre-rRNA are transported by chromosomes from maternal cells into daughter cells. At the end of mitosis, all types of pre-rRNA and 28S rRNA can be visualized in nucleolus-derived foci (NDF), structures containing many proteins of mature nucleoli the appearance of which indicates the commencement of nucleologenesis. However, early NDF are enriched in less processed pre-RNA, whereas late NDF contain predominantly 28S rRNA. Altogether, the results of this study strengthen the hypotheses that postulate that different forms of pre-rRNA may play various roles in mitosis, and that NDF can be involved in the maturation of pre-rRNA, remaining preserved in the cytoplasm of dividing cells.",

Bibliometric analysis methods are the main methods for quantitative analysis of scientific cooperation, efficiency, and other aspects of scientific activity. The information base for this research includes materials from science citation databases containing bibliographic descriptions of the articles published in scientific journals (mainly written in English) in a significant number of fields of science. Various parameters (e.g. dynamics of the number of publications, the number of citation, the level of co-authorship, the scientific specialization index, etc.) at various levels of aggregation (e.g. individual researchers, research organizations, countries and regions of the world) can be calculated based on these data. The results of bibliometric studies can be used in a number of ways: - analysis of latest trends in the development of various scientific fields; - evaluation of the effectiveness of research organizations; - overall assessment of the scientific potential of Russia (its strengths and weaknesses); - identification the most productive scientists in various fields of science; - drawing the international comparisons of publications; - analysis of collaboration networks of scientific teams. The paper analyses the basic indicators of the publication activity of scientists in Russia and the leading countries over the period between 2001 and 2011. Publication activity of Russian scientists is analysed in the context of specific areas of science. This allows the identification of areas of specialization of Russian publications. The paper also examines the dynamics of highly-cited publications and the indicators of the international scientific collaboration of Russian researchers.

    "abstract": "11% of the human genome is composed of Alu-retrotransposons, whose transcription by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) leads to the accumulation of several hundreds to thousands of Alu-RNA copies in the cytoplasm. Expression of Alu-RNA Pol III is significantly increased at various levels of stress, and the increase in the Alu-RNA level is accompanied by a suppression of proliferation, a decrease in viability, and induction of apoptotic processes in human cells. However, the question about the biological functions of Pol III Alu-transcripts, as well as their mechanism of action, remains open. In this work, analogues of Alu-RNA and its evolutionary ancestor, 7SL RNA, were synthesized. Transfection of human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells with the Alu-RNA and 7SL RNA analogues is accompanied by a decrease in viability and by induction of proapoptotic changes in these cells. The analysis of the combined action of these analogues and actinomycin D or tamoxifen revealed that the decreased viability of MCF-7 cells transfected with Alu-RNA and 7SL RNA was due to the modulation of transcription. A whole transcriptome analysis of gene expression revealed that increased gene expression of the transcription regulator NUPR1 (p8), as well as the transcription factor DDIT3 (CHOP), occurs under the action of both the Alu- and 7SL RNA analogues on MCF-7 cells. It has been concluded that induction of proapoptotic changes in human cells under the influence of the Alu-RNA and 7SL RNA analogues is related to the transcriptional activation of the genes of cellular stress factors, including the endoplasmic reticulum stress response factors.",

    "abstract": "Organophosphate toxins (OPs) are the most toxic low-molecular compounds. The extremely potent toxicity of OPs is determined by their specificity toward the nerve system. Human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) is a natural bioscavenger against a broad spectrum of OPs, which makes it a promising candidate for the development of DNA-encoded bioscavengers. The high values of the protective index observed for recombinant hBChE (rhBChE) make it appropriate for therapy against OP poisoning, especially in the case of highly toxic warfare nerve agents. Nevertheless, large-scale application of biopharmaceuticals based on hBChE is restricted due to its high cost and extremely rapid elimination from the bloodstream. In the present study, we examine two approaches for long-acting rhBChE production: I) chemical polysialylation and II) in-vivo tetramerization. We demonstrate that both approaches significantly improve the pharmacokinetic characteristics of rhBChE (more than 5 and 10 times, respectively), which makes it possible to use rhBChE conjugated with polysialic acids (rhBChE-CAO) and tetrameric rhBChE (4rhBChE) in the treatment of OP poisonings.",

When bound to RNA, RBPs act as guardians of the genome integrity at different levels, from DNA damage prevention to the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Recently, RBPs have been shown to participate in DNA repair. This fact is of special interest as DNA repair pathways do not generally involve RNA. DNA damage in higher organisms triggers the formation of the RNA-like polymer - poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). Nucleic acid-like properties allow PAR to recruit DNA- and RNA-binding proteins to the site of DNA damage. It is suggested that poly(ADP-ribose) and RBPs not only modulate the activities of DNA repair factors, but that they also play an important role in the formation of transient repairosome complexes in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic biomolecules are subjected to similar sorting during the formation of RNA assemblages by functionally related mRNAs and promiscuous RBPs. The Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) is the major component of cytoplasmic RNA granules. Although YB-1 is a classic RNA-binding protein, it is now regarded as a non-canonical factor of DNA repair.",

A high activity and metastability by these arachidonic acid derivatives suggests the existence of supramolecular structures that are involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis and directed translocation of thromboxane to the receptor. The objective of this study was to identify TBXAS1 protein partners from human liver tissue lysate using a complex approach based on the direct molecular fishing technique, LC-MS/MS protein identification, and protein-protein interaction validation by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As a result, 12 potential TBXAS1 protein partners were identified, including the components regulating cytoskeleton organization (BBIP1 and ANKMY1), components of the coagulation cascade of human blood (SERPINA1, SERPINA3, APOH, FGA, and FN1), and the enzyme involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous bioregulators (CYP2E1). SPR validation on the Biacore 3000 biosensor confirmed the effectiveness of the interaction between CYP2E1 (the enzyme that converts prostaglandin H2 to 12-HHT/thromboxane A2 proantagonist) and TBXAS1 (Kd = (4.3 0.4) 10-7 M). Importantly, the TBXAS1CYP2E1 complex formation increases fivefold in the presence of isatin (indole-2,3-dione, a low-molecular nonpeptide endogenous bioregulator, a product of CYP2E1). These results suggest that the interaction between these hemoproteins is important in the regulation of the biosynthesis of eicosanoids.",

The presence of the listed properties and their preservation in the case of peroral treatment determines the prospects of research. Taking into account the previous findings on the ability of GK-2 to selectively activate PI3K/Akt, these data suggest that Akt-signaling is sufficient for pancreatic beta cell function.

    "abstract": "Spinal cord astrocytomas are rare diseases of the central nervous system. The localization of these tumors and their infiltrative growth complicate their surgical resection, increase the risk of postoperative complications, and require more careful use of radio- and chemotherapy. The information on the genetic mutations associated with the onset and development of astrocytomas provides a more accurate neoplasm diagnosis and classification. In some cases, it also allows one to determine the optimal methods for treating the neoplasm, as well as to predict the treatment outcomes and the risks of relapse. To date, a number of molecular markers that are associated with brain astrocytomas and possess prognostic value have been identified and described. Due to the significantly lower incidence of spinal cord astrocytomas, the data on similar markers are much more sparse and are presented with a lesser degree of systematization. However, due to the retrospective studies of clinical material that have been actively conducted abroad in recent years, the formation of statistically significant genetic landscapes for various types of tumors, including intradural spinal cord tumors, has begun. In this regard, the purpose of this review is to analyze and systematize the information on the most significant genetic mutations associated with various types of astrocytomas, as well as discuss the prospects for using the corresponding molecular markers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.",

However, only the total virion charge (isoelectric point) has been determined for most plant viruses. Here, we report on the first application of positively charged magnetic nanoparticles for mapping the surface charge distribution of helical plant viruses. The charge was demonstrated to be unevenly distributed on the surface of viruses belonging to different taxonomic groups, with the negative charge being predominantly located at one end of the virions. This charge distribution is mainly controlled by viral RNA.",

Thirty women with pelvic varicosities and a reflux blood flow were investigated using duplex ultrasonography. Group 1 included 18 patients with clinical signs of the pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), including venous pelvic pain (VPP). Group 2 consisted of 12 patients with pelvic varicosities with no clinical signs of PCS. Group 1. The score of VPP intensity ranged from 4 to 8; the mean score being 4.84 ± 0.43. The CGRP level in the studied group ranged from 0.39 to 1.01 ng/mL; the SP level ranged from 0.005 to 1.33 ng/mL. Group 2. The CGRP values were 0.15-0.32 ng/mL, and the SP range was 0.003-0.3 ng/mL. In this group, the levels of the studied peptides were 3-5 times lower than those for the patients with VPP. Group 3. The mean CGRP values were 0.06 ± 0.003 ng/mL, and the mean SP values were 0.03 ± 0.001 ng/mL. These values were considered as the reference parameters; a statistical analysis was performed for them. The correlation analysis revealed a strong relationship between the CGRP and VPP levels (r = 0.82) and a medium correlation between the SP level and pelvic pain in Group 1. The CGRP and SP levels in blood plasma highly correlate with the presence of pelvic venous pain.",

    "abstract": "The use of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) is limited by its cardiotoxic effect. The aim of this work was to study the effect of a new synthetic agonist of the galanin receptor GalR1-3 [βAla14, His15]-galanine (2-15) (G) on the metabolism, antioxidant enzyme activity, and cardiac function in rats with cardiomyopathy (CM) caused by chronic administration of Dox. Coadministration of peptide G and Dox significantly increased the fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) by an average of 30 ± 4% compared with the indices in the Dox group. The reduced severity of cardiac dysfunction under the action of G was accompanied by a 2.5-fold decrease in the activity of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) in blood plasma. The protective mechanism of the action of peptide G is caused by a reduced lipid peroxidation (LP) that is due to the increased activity of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the damaged heart. Administration of peptide G significantly increased the adenine nucleotide pool (ΣAH), ATP content, and the levels of phosphocreatine (PCr) and total creatine (ΣCr) in the damaged myocardium. It also reduced lactate accumulation relative to its content in the Dox group. The better energy supply of cardiomyocytes after treatment with peptide G prevented the accumulation of cytotoxic ammonia and disruption in the metabolism of the key myocardial amino acids (glutamic acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp), and alanine (Ala)). Peptide G significantly improved the morphological parameters of the heart in rats treated with Dox. The results show promise in using peptide G to efficiently correct functional, morphological, and metabolic damage to the heart caused by anthracycline chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluvoxamine, are widely used to treat depressive disorders in pregnant women. These antidepressants effectively penetrate through the placental barrier, affecting the fetus during the critical phase of neurodevelopment. Some clinical studies have linked prenatal exposure to SSRIs with increased neonatal mortality, premature birth, decreased fetal growth and delay in psychomotor development. However, the effects of prenatal exposure to SSRIs remain unknown. The administration of SSRIs in rodents during the first postnatal weeks is considered as an model for studying the effects of prenatal SSRIs exposure in human. The aim of this work was to study the acute effects of chronic fluvoxamine (FA) administration in white rat pups. The study was carried out in male and female rat pups treated with FA (10 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally) from postnatal days 1 to 14. The lethality level, body weight, age of eye opening, and motor reflex maturation were recorded. The contents of biogenic amines and their metabolites in different brain structures were also determined. It was shown that neonatal FA administration led to increased lethality level, reduced body weight, and delayed maturation of motor reflexes. Furthermore, increased noradrenalin level in hypothalamus, serotonin level in hippocampus and serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA level in frontal cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum were observed in drug-treated animals compared to the control group. We can conclude that the altered activity of the serotoninergic system induced by fluvoxamine administration at early developmental stages leads to a delay in physical and motor development.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes affects over 350 million people worldwide, with the figure projected to rise to nearly 500 million over the next 20 years, according to the World Health Organization. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 diabetes) is an endocrine disorder caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, which leads to insulin deficiency. Administration of exogenous insulin remains at the moment the treatment mainstay. This approach helps to regulate blood glucose levels and significantly increases the life expectancy of patients. However, type 1 diabetes is accompanied by long-term complications associated with the systemic nature of the disease and metabolic abnormalities having a profound impact on health. Of greater impact would be a therapeutic approach which would overcome these limitations by better control of blood glucose levels and prevention of acute and chronic complications. The current efforts in the field of regenerative medicine are aimed at finding such an approach. In this review, we discuss the time-honored technique of donor islets of Langerhans transplantation. We also focus on the use of pluripotent stem and committed cells and cellular reprogramming. The molecular mechanisms of pancreatic differentiation are highlighted. Much attention is devoted to the methods of grafts delivery and to the materials used during its creation.",

    "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope proteins E1 and E2, being virion components, are involved in the formation of infectious particles in infected cells. The detailed structure of the infectious particle of HCV remains poorly understood. Moreover, the virion assembly and release of virions by the cell are the least understood processes. It is believed that virion properties depend on glycosylation of the virus envelope proteins in a cell, while glycansat several glycosylation sites of these proteins play a pivotal role in protein functioning and the HCV life cycle. N-glycans of glycoproteins can influence viral particle formation, virus binding to cell surface, and HCV pathogenesis. We studied the effect of glycans on the folding ofthe E2 glycoprotein, formation of functional glycoprotein complexes and virus particles in insect and mammalian cells. In order to investigate these processes, point mutations of the N-glycosylation sites of HCV protein E2 (genotype 1b strain 274933RU) were generated and the mutant proteins were further analyzed in the baculovirus expression system. Elimination of the single glycosylation sites of the E2 glycoprotein, except for the N6 site, did not affect its synthesis efficiency in Sf9 insect cells, while the electrophoretic mobility of mutant proteins increased in proportion to the decrease in the number of glycosylation sites. The level of synthesis of HCV glycoprotein E2 in human HEK293T cells depended on the presence of glycans at the N1 and N8 glycosylation sites in contrast to Sf9 cells. At the same time, elimination of glycans at the N1, N2, and N10 sites led to the accumulation of unproductive E1E2 dimers as aggregates and productive assembly suppression of virus-like particles both in insect and mammalian cells. In addition, elimination of single glycosylation sites of HCV E2 had no impact on the RNA synthesis of structural proteins and formation of virus-like particles in insect and mammalian cells.",

A number of biochemical features have been identified in patients with GBA-associated Parkinson's disease (GBA-PD). In particular, these include decreased activity of glucocerebrosidase and accumulation of the glucosylceramide substrate. These features were the basis for putting forward a hypothesis about treatment of GBA-PD using new strategies aimed at restoring glucocerebrosidase activity and reducing the substrate concentration. This paper discusses the molecular and genetic mechanisms of GBA-PD pathogenesis and potential approaches to the treatment of this form of the disease.",

Basic achievements in genome research have resulted in the deciphering of the human genome and creation of a molecular landmarks map of the human haploid genome (HapMap Project), which has made a tremendous contribution to our understanding of common genetic and multifactorial (complex) disorders. Current genome studies mainly focus on genetic testing and gene association studies of multifactorial (complex) diseases, with the purpose of their efficient diagnostics and prevention . Identification of candidate (“predisposition”) genes participating in the functional genetic modules underlying each common disorder and the use of this genetic background to elaborate sophisticated measures to efficiently prevent them constitutes a major goal in personalized molecular medicine. The concept of a genetic pass as an individual DNA databank reflecting inherited human predisposition to different complex and monogenic disorders, with special emphasis on its present state, and the numerous difficulties related to the practical implementation of personalized medicine are outlined. The problems related to the uncertainness of the results of genetic testing could be overcome at least partly by means of new technological achievements in genome research methods, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), massive parallel DNA sequencing, and genetic and epigenetic profiling. The basic tasks of genomic today could be determined as the need to properly estimate the clinical value of genetic testing and its applicability in clinical practice. Feasible ways towards the gradual implementation of personal genetic data, in line with routine laboratory tests, for the benefit of clinical practice are discussed.",

The intramuscular administration of RNase A (0.35-7 µ g/kg) or DNase I (0.02-2.3 mg/kg) resulted in a considerable decrease in the metastasis number into the lungs of animals with Lewis lung carcinoma and a decrease of the hepatic index of animals with hepatoma 1A. A histological analysis of the organs occupied by metastases revealed that the administration of RNase A and DNase I induced metastasis pathomorphism as manifested by the destruction of oncocytes, an increase in necrosis and apoptosis foci in metastases, and mononuclear infiltration.

These two methods are partly complementary, and by using them in parallel one can significantly improve the selection efficiency. Parallel restriction analysis (finger-printing) of PCR-amplified cloned sequences coding for mini-antibodies (HMR-analysis) is proposed for identifying individual clones, as a replacement to sequencing (to a certain extent). Using this method, unique data were collected on the selection of mini-antibody variants with the required specificity at various stages of a multi-stage selection procedure.

    "abstract": "Recombinant immunoconjugates of marker enzymes with antigens or antibodies present considerably more advantages than those obtained by conventional methods of chemical synthesis; i.e. they are homogeneous, have a strictly determined stoichiometry, and retain the functional activity of both a marker protein and an antigen/antibody. Based on the pPICZαB shuttle vector, we first managed to obtain a recombinant conjugate of key marker enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) withFabfragments of antibodies against atrazine. The resulting genetic construction allows us to switch to any other antibody sequence, via the simple re-cloning of variable parts and an additional reporter enzyme. Conjugates were successfully produced in thePichia pastorismethylotrophic yeast expression system. The target activity of the conjugates (both enzymatic and antigen-binding) has been demonstrated by ELISA method.",

    "abstract": "The primary aim of this research report is to analyse the dynamics and structure of the publications of Russian authors, as well as to define the place of Russian science in the global scientific process. Bibliometric analysis methods are the main methods for quantitative analysis of scientific cooperation, efficiency, and other aspects of scientific activity. The information base for this research includes materials from science citation databases containing bibliographic descriptions of the articles published in scientific journals (mainly written in English) in a significant number of fields of science. Various parameters (e.g. dynamics of the number of publications, the number of citation, the level of co-authorship, the scientific specialization index, etc.) at various levels of aggregation (e.g. individual researchers, research organizations, countries and regions of the world) can be calculated based on these data. The results of bibliometric studies can be used in a number of ways: - analysis of latest trends in the development of various scientific fields; - evaluation of the effectiveness of research organizations; - overall assessment of the scientific potential of Russia (its strengths and weaknesses); - identification the most productive scientists in various fields of science; - drawing the international comparisons of publications; - analysis of collaboration networks of scientific teams. The paper analyses the basic indicators of the publication activity of scientists in Russia and the leading countries over the period between 2001 and 2011. Publication activity of Russian scientists is analysed in the context of specific areas of science. This allows the identification of areas of specialization of Russian publications. The paper also examines the dynamics of highly-cited publications and the indicators of the international scientific collaboration of Russian researchers. In this paper, materials of Web of Science database were used for analysis of publication activity.",

Proteins of the immune system, as well as proteins that are involved in the infiltration of activated immune cells in the CNS, play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS. We investigated the association and linkage with MS of the following immune-system genes polymorphisms: HLA-DRB1,CTLA4,TGFB1,IL4,CCR5 andRANTES, as well as of the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) genes polymorphisms. For this purpose we used the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). The group investigated was comprised of 100 nuclear families of Russian ethnicity, each consisting of an affected offspring and his nonaffected parents. It was found that HLA-DRB1*15alleleandMMP9*-1562C allele were transmitted from healthy heterozygous parents to affected children more frequently than alternative alleles (p = 0.02 andp = 0.04, respectively). Another family-based method, AFBAC (affected family-based control), showed MS association with HLA-DRB1*15, but not with theMMP9*-1562C allele.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) constitute one of the biggest families of membrane proteins. In spite of the fact that they are highly relevant to pharmacy, they have remained poorly explored. One of the main bottlenecks encountered in structural-functional studies of GPCRs is the difficulty to produce sufficient amounts of the proteins. Cell-free systems based on bacterial extracts fromE. colicells attract much attention as an effective tool for recombinant production of membrane proteins. GPCR production in bacterial cell-free expression systems is often inefficient because of the problems associated with the low efficiency of the translation initiation process. This problem could be resolved if GPCRs were expressed in the form of hybrid proteins with N-terminal polypeptide fusion tags. In the present work, three new N-terminal fusion tags are proposed for cell-free production of the human β2-adrenergic receptor, human M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and human somatostatin receptor type 5. It is demonstrated that the application of an N-terminal fragment (6 a.a.) of bacteriorhodopsin fromExiguobacterium sibiricum(ESR-tag), N-terminal fragment (16 а.о.) of RNAse A (S-tag), and Mistic protein fromB. subtilisallows to increase the CF synthesis of the target GPCRs by 5-38 times, resulting in yields of 0.6-3.8 mg from 1 ml of the reaction mixture, which is sufficient for structural-functional studies.",

    "abstract": "For the first time in the history of ethnic Russians, an association analysis the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) was performed for the mitochondrial haplogroups H, J, K, and U, as well as for the individual mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms discriminating these haplogroups (m.1719G A, m. 7028C T, m.9055G A, m.10398A G, m.12308A G). A total of 283 unrelated patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS and 290 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Association of haplogroup J with MS was observed (P = 0.0055, OR = 2.00 [95% CI 1.21-3.41]). After gender stratification, the association remained significant in women (P = 0.0083, OR = 2.20 [95% CI 1.19-4.03]). A multilocus analysis of the association between combinations of mtDNA haplogroups with variants of 38 nuclear immune-related genes and MS risk was carried out. MS-associated biallelic combinations of haplogroup J with the alleles CCL5 rs2107538*A, PVT1 rs2114358*G, TNFSF14 rs1077667*C, and IL4 rs2243250*C, which were not associated with MS individually, were identified. For the combination of haplogroup J and the CCL5*A allele (P = 0.00043, OR = 5.47 [95% CI 1.85-16.15]), a epistatic (synergistic) interaction between the components was established using two statistical criteria: the PFLINT value in the Fisher-like interaction numeric test and the synergy factor, SF (PFLINT = 0.025, SF = 4.32 [95% CI 1.20-15.60]). The combination of haplogroup J and the PVT1*G allele is characterized by PFLINT = 0.084; SF = 3.05 [95% CI 1.00-9.31] and can also be epistatic. Thus, interaction between nuclear and mitochondrial genome components in the risk of developing MS was demonstrated for the first time.",

We previously developed a polyvalent DNA vaccine based on five VARV antigens and an attenuated variant of the vaccinia virus (VACV) with targeted deletion of six genes (VAC6). Independent experiments demonstrated that triple immunization with a DNA vaccine and double immunization with VAC6 provide protection to mice against a lethal dose (10 LD50) of the ectromelia virus (ECTV), which is highly pathogenic for mice. The present work was aimed at comparing the immunity to smallpox generated by various immunization protocols using the DNA vaccine and VAC6. It has been established that immunization of mice with a polyvalent DNA vaccine, followed by boosting with recombinant VAC6, as well as double immunization with VAC6, induces production of VACV-neutralizing antibodies and provides protection to mice against a 150 LD50 dose of ECTV. The proposed immunization protocols can be used to develop safe vaccination strategies against smallpox and other human orthopoxvirus infections.",

SkQ1 is expelled from E. coli cells by the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump. In this study, we demonstrate that SkQ1 resistance in E. coli, in contrast to chloramphenicol resistance, does not depend on the presence of the multidrug efflux pump accessory protein AcrZ.",

Inhibitors of HIV-1 integration have been under development for over 10 years; yet, only one integration inhibitor, raltegravir, has been approved for clinical use so far. Raltegravir binds two metal ions in the enzyme's active centre and blocks one of the integration stages: the strand transfer. Unfortunately, the clinical use of raltegravir results in the development of viral resistance among some patients. Several more HIV-1 integration inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials at the moment. However, the structure and mechanism of action of those are similar to raltegravir, which results in the emergence of cross resistance with raltegravir. The present review is focused on the history of the development and clinical trials of raltegravir and its analogues, the problems connected with the emergence of viral resistance to integration inhibitors, and the prospect of their future clinical use.",

It was found that the growth in the number of articles covered by JCR (a 1.8-fold increase compared to 1995) is ahead of the growth rates of Russian publications (1.2-fold increase). Hence, the share of Russian articles covered by JCR-SE was down from 2.5% in 1995 to 1.7% in 2010. It was determined that the number of articles published in an average Russian journal reduced by 20% as compared to the number of articles in an average journal of the full data set. These facts could partly shed light on the question why Russian research performance is staggering (approximately 30,000 articles per year), although the coverage of Russian journals has expanded to 150 titles. Over the past 15 years, a twofold increase in the impact factor of the Russian journals has been observed, which is higher than that for the full data set of journals (a 1.4-fold increase).

    "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) triggers a chronic disease that is often accompanied by a spectrum of liver pathologies and metabolic alterations. The oxidative stress that occurs in the infected cells is considered as one of the mechanisms of HCV pathogenesis. It is induced by the viral core and NS5A proteins. It is already known that both of these proteins activate the antioxidant defense system controlled by the Nrf2 transcription factor. Here, we show that this activation is mediated by domain 1 of the NS5A protein and two fragments of the core protein. In both cases, this activation is achieved through two mechanisms. One of them is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein kinase C, whereas the other is triggered through ROS-independent activation of casein kinase 2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. In the case of the HCV core, the ROS-dependent mechanism was assigned to the 37-191 a.a. fragment, while the ROS-independent mechanism was assigned to the 1-36 а.a. fragment. Such assignment of the mechanisms to different domains is the first evidence of their independence. In addition, our data revealed that intracellular localization of HCV proteins has no impact on the regulation of the antioxidant defense system.",

In addition, there are protocols that enable ex vivo amplification of cord blood cells based on native hematopoietic microenvironmental cues, including stromal components and the tissue-relevant oxygen level. The newest techniques for ex vivo expansion of HSPCs are based on data from the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing the hematopoietic niche function. Application of these methods has provided an improvement of several important clinical outcomes. Alternative methods of cord blood transplantation enhancement based on optimization of HPSC homing and engraftment in patient tissues have also been successful.

    "abstract": "Terrestrial plants have contributed massively to the development of modern oncologic drugs. Despite the wide acceptance of Mauritian endemic flowering plants in traditional medicine, scientific evidence of their chemotherapeutic potential is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro tumor cytotoxicity of leaf extracts from five Mauritian endemic medicinal plants, namely Acalypha integrifolia Willd (Euphorbiaceae), Labourdonnaisia glauca Bojer (Sapotaceae), Dombeya acutangula Cav. subsp. rosea Friedmann (Malvaceae), Gaertnera psychotrioides (DC.) Baker (Rubiaceae), and Eugenia tinifolia Lam (Myrtaceae). The cytotoxicities of the extracts were determined against six human cancer cell lines, including cervical adenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The potent extracts were further investigated using cell cycle analysis and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis. The antioxidant properties and polyphenolic profile of the potent extracts were also evaluated. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses revealed the presence of (+)-catechin and gallocatechin in E. tinifolia and L. glauca, while gallic acid was detected in A. integrifolia. L. glauca, A. integrifolia, and E. tinifolia were highly selective towards human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (KYSE-30) cells. L. glauca and E. tinifolia arrested KYSE- 30 cells in the G2/M phase, in a concentration-dependent manner. RPPA analysis indicated that the extracts may partly exert their tumor growth-inhibitory activity by upregulating the intracellular level of 5AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). The findings highlight the potent antiproliferative activity of three Mauritian endemic leaf extracts against oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and calls for further investigation into their chemotherapeutic application.",

    "abstract": "Several new actinoporin isoforms with molecular weights of 18995.5 to 19398.7 Da exhibiting a high hemolytic activity were isolated from the tropical sea anemone Heteractis crispa using a combination of liquid chromatography techniques. The actinoporins were demonstrated to occur as mono-, di-, and trimers in aqueous solutions. The sequences of the genes encoding actinoporins were identified, and the amino acid sequences of the new polypeptides belonging to the Hct-A actinoporin family were obtained. The new acinoporins differ in their isoelectric points, the number and localization of charged amino acid residues at the functionally important N-terminal fragment of the molecule, as well as in the charge of a tetrapeptide (amino acid residues 74-77) involved in an electrostatic interaction with the cytoplasmic membrane. A recombinant actinoporin, rHct-A2, with a molecular weight of 19141 Da, pI of 9.64, and hemolytic activity of 4.0 104 HU/mg, was obtained. The conductivity of the ion channels formed by rHct-A2 in the BLM was demonstrated to be similar to that of the native actinoporin from H. crispa. The obtained data expand knowledge on the structural and functional relationships of actinoporins and contribute to our understanding of the functioning mechanism of these molecules, which is the basis for the development of compounds with a high biomedical potential. Currently, they are considered as models for obtaining antitumor, antibacterial, and cardiac-stimulating agents.",

    "abstract": "Current targeting strategies for genetic vectors imply the creation of a specific vector for every targeted receptor, which is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, the development of a universal vector system whose surface can specifically bind molecules to provide efficient targeting is of particular interest. In this study, we propose a new approach in creating targeted vectors based on the genome of human adenovirus serotype 5 carrying the modified gene of the capsid protein pIX (Ad5-EGFP-pIX-ER): recombinant pseudoadenoviral nanoparticles (RPANs). The surfaces of such RPANs are able to bind properly modified chimeric nanoantibodies that specifically recognize a particular target antigen (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) with high affinity. The efficient binding of nanoantibodies (аСЕА-RE) to the RPAN capsid surfaces has been demonstrated by ELISA. The ability of the constructed vector to deliver target genes has been confirmed by experiments with the tumor cell lines A549 and Lim1215 expressing CEA. It has been shown that Ad5-EGFP-pIX-ER carrying аСЕА-RE on its surface penetrates into the tumor cell lines A549 and Lim1215 via the CAR-independent pathway three times more efficiently than unmodified RPAN and Ad5-EGFP-pIX-ER without nanoantibodies on the capsid surface. Thus, RPAN Ad5-EGFP-pIX-ER is a universal platform that may be useful for targeted gene delivery in specific cells due to nanoantibody-modified RPAN binding.",

    "abstract": "IRR (insulin receptor-related receptor) is a receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the insulin receptor family, which also includes insulin receptor and IGF-IR receptor. We have previously shown that IRR is activated by extracellular fluid with pH > 7.9 and regulates excess alkali excretion in the body. We performed a bioinformatic analysis of the pH-sensitive potential of all three members of the insulin receptor family of various animal species (from frog to man) and their chimeras with swapping of different domains in the extracellular region. An analysis using the AcalPred program showed that insulin receptor family proteins are divided into two classes: one class with the optimal working pH in the acidic medium (virtually all insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor orthologs, except for the IGF-IR ortholog from Xenopus laevis) and the second class with the optimal working pH in the alkaline medium (all IRR orthologs). The program had predicted that the most noticeable effect on the pH-sensitive property of IRR would be caused by the replacement of the L1 and C domains in its extracellular region, as well as the replacement of the second and third fibronectin repeats. It had also been assumed that replacement of the L2 domain would have the least significant effect on the alkaline sensitivity of IRR. To test the in silico predictions, we obtained three constructs with swapping of the L1C domains, the third L2 domain, and all three domains L1CL2 of IRR with similar domains of the insulin-like growth factor receptor. We found that replacement of the L1C and L1CL2 domains reduces the receptor's ability to be activated with alkaline pH, thus increasing the half-maximal effective concentration by about 100%. Replacement of the L2 domain increased the half-maximal effective concentration by 40%. Thus, our results indicate the high predictive potential of the AcalPred algorithm, not only for the pH-sensitive enzymes, but also for pH-sensitive receptors.",

Since cognitive impairments in Williams syndrome are caused by LIMK1 hemizygosity, could the spontaneous and mutant variants of the Drosophila limk1 gene serve as a model for studying two diagnostic features from three distinct cognitive defects of the syndrome? These two symptoms are the disturbance of visuospatial orientation and an unusualy strong fixation on the faces of other people during pairwise interaction with a stranger. An experimental approach to the first cognitive manifestation might be an analysis of the locomotor behavior of Drosophila larvae involving visuospatial orientation during the exploration of the surrounding environment. An approach to tackle the second manifestation might be an analysis of the most natural ways of contact between a male and a female during courtship (the first stage of this ritual is the orientation of a male towards a female and following the female with constant fixation on the females image). The present study of locomotor activity and cognitive repertoire in spontaneous and mutant variants of the Drosophila agnostic locus allows one to bridge alterations in the structure of the limk1 gene and behavior.",

In 2014-2015, six lines were evaluated for resistance to herbicide treatment under semi-natural conditions. All selected transgenic lines were resistant to the herbicide Basta at doses equivalent to 10 l/ha (twofold normal field dosage) whereas the control plants died at 2.5 l/ha. Foliar NH4-N concentrations in transgenic plants did not change after treatment. Extremely low temperatures in the third ten-day period of October 2014 revealed differences in freeze tolerance between the lines obtained from Pt of f2 aspen genotypes.

The native conformation of the HA2 fragment was partially preserved upon its attachment to the C-terminus of flagellin within the recombinant fusion protein FlgMH.

    "abstract": "Production of novel polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), biodegradable polymers for biomedical applications, and biomaterials based on them is a promising trend in modern bioengineering. We studied the ability of an effective strain-producer Azotobacter chroococcum 7B to synthesize not only poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) homopolymer (PHB) and its main copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), but also a novel copolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy-4-methylvalerate) (PHB4MV). For the biosynthesis of PHB copolymers, we used carboxylic acids as additional carbon sources and monomer precursors in the chain of synthesized copolymers. The main parameters of these polymers biosynthesis were determined: strain-producer biomass yield, polymer yield, molecular weight and monomer composition of the synthesized polymers, as well as the morphology of A. chroococcum 7B bacterial cells. The physico-chemical properties of the polymers were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), contact angle test, and other methods. In vitro biocompatibility of the obtained polymers was investigated using stromal cells isolated from the bone marrow of rats with the XTT cell viability test. The synthesis of the novel copolymer PHB4MV and its chemical composition were demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy: the addition of 4-methylvaleric acid to the culture medium resulted in incorporation of 3-hydroxy-4-methylvalerate (3H4MV) monomers into the PHB polymer chain (0.6 mol%). Despite the low molar content of 3H4MV in the obtained copolymer, its physico-chemical properties were significantly different from those of the PHB homopolymer: it has lower crystallinity and a higher contact angle, i.e. the physico-chemical properties of the PHB4MV copolymer containing only 0.6 mol% of 3H4MV corresponded to a PHBV copolymer with a molar content ranging from 2.5% to 7.8%. In vitro biocompatibility of the obtained PHB4MV copolymer, measured in the XTT test, was not statistically different from the cell growth of PHB and PHBV polymers, which make its use possible in biomedical research and development.",

    "abstract": "One of the promising fields of modern molecular biology is the search for new proteins that regulate the various stages of the immune response and the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of action of these proteins. Such proteins include the multifunctional protein PGLYRP1/Tag7, belonging to the PGRP-S protein family, whose gene was discovered in mice at the Institute of Gene Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, in 1996. PGLYRP1/Tag7 is classified as a protein of innate immunity; however, it can also participate in the regulation of acquired immunity mechanisms. In this paper, we consider the involvement of PGLYRP1/Tag7 in the triggering of antimicrobial defense mechanisms and formation of subsets of cytotoxic lymphocytes that kill tumor cells. The paper emphasizes that the multifaceted functional activity of Tag7 in the immune response has to do with its ability to interact with various proteins to form stable protein complexes. Hsp70-associated Tag7 can induce the death of tumor cells carrying the TNFR1 receptor. Tag7, associated with the Mts1 (S100A4) protein, can stimulate the migration of innate and adaptive immune cytotoxic lymphocytes to a lesion site. Involvement of Tag7 in the regulation of immunological processes suggests that it may be considered as a promising agent in cancer therapy. These properties of Tag7 were used to develop autologous vaccines that have passed the first and second phases of clinical trials in patients with end-stage melanoma and renal cancer. The C-terminal peptide of Tag7, isolated by limited proteolysis, was shown to protect the cartilage and bone tissue of the ankle joint in mice with induced autoimmune arthritis and may be a promising drug for suppressing the development of inflammatory processes.",

Covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation affects the activity of the proteins engaged in DNA repair, chromatin structure regulation, gene expression, RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, and protein translation. Non-covalent PAR-dependent interactions are involved in the various types of cellular response to stress and viral infection, such as inflammation, hormonal signaling, and the immune response. The review discusses how structurally different poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) molecules composed of identical monomers can differentially participate in various cellular processes acting as the so-called \"PAR code.\" The article describes the ability of PAR polymers to form functional biomolecular clusters through a phase-separation in response to various signals. This phase-separation contributes to rapid spatial segregation of biochemical processes and effective recruitment of the necessary components. The cellular PAR level is tightly controlled by a network of regulatory proteins: PAR code writers, readers, and erasers. Impaired PAR metabolism is associated with the development of pathological processes causing oncological, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. Pharmacological correction of the PAR level may represent a new approach to the treatment of various diseases.",

    "abstract": "The structure of the haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) in 9 population groups from Northern Eurasia and populations of the international HapMap project was investigated in the present study. The data suggest that the architecture of LD in the human genome is largely determined by the evolutionary history of populations; however, the results of phylogenetic and haplotype analyses seems to suggest that in fact there may be a common old mechanism for the formation of certain patterns of LD. Variability in the structure of LD and the level of diversity of MTHFR haplotypes cause a certain set of tagSNPs with an established prognostic significance for each population. In our opinion, the results obtained in the present study are of considerable interest for understanding multiple genetic phenomena: namely, the association of interpopulation differences in the patterns of LD with structures possessing a genetic susceptibility to complex diseases, and the functional significance of the pleiotropic MTHFR gene effect. Summarizing the results of this study, a conclusion can be made that the genetic variability analysis with emphasis on the structure of LD in human populations is a powerful tool that can make a significant contribution to such areas of biomedical science as human evolutionary biology, functional genomics, genetics of complex diseases, and pharmacogenomics.",

PCP consists of 7 interrelated modules, each containing four levels of proteomic and biomedical data on the proteins in corresponding tissues or cells. The first data level, onto which each module is based, is a 2DE proteomic reference map where proteins separated by 2D electrophoresis, and subsequently identified by mass-spectrometry, are marked. The results of proteomic experiments form the second data level. The third level contains protein data from published articles and existing databases. The fourth level is formed with direct Internet links to the information on corresponding proteins in the NCBI and UniProt databases. PCP contains data on 359 proteins in total, including 17 potential biomarkers of prostate cancer, particularly AGR2, annexins, S100 proteins, PRO2675, and PRO2044. The database will be useful in a wide range of applications, including studies of molecular mechanisms of the aetiology and pathogenesis of prostate diseases, finding new diagnostic markers, etc.",

A panel of DNA immunogens has been developed, some are already in the clinical trials. However, the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines, specifically of those applied to humans, needs a considerable improvement. There are several approaches to increase DNA vaccine immunogenicity. One approach implies the modifications of the encoded immunogen that change its processing and presentation, and thus the overall pattern of anti-immunogen response. For this, eukaryotic expression vectors are constructed that encode the chimeric proteins composed of the immunogen and specialized targeting or signal sequences. The review describes a number of signals that if fused to immunogen, target it into the predefined subcellular compartments. The review gives examples of their application for DNA-immunization.",

    "abstract": "Hemophilia B patients suffer from an inherited blood-clotting defect and require regular administration of blood-clotting factor IX replacement therapy. Recombinant human factor IX produced in cultured CHO cells is nearly identical to natural, plasma-derived factor IX and is widely used in clinical practice. Development of a biosimilar recombinant human factor IX for medical applications requires the generation of a clonal cell line with the highest specific productivity possible and a high level of specific procoagulant activity of the secreted factor IX. We previously developed plasmid vectors, p1.1 and p1.2, based on the untranslated regions of the translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene from Chinese hamster. These vectors allow one to perform the methotrexate- driven amplification of the genome-integrated target genes and co-transfect auxiliary genes linked to various resistance markers. The natural open reading frame region of the factor IX gene was cloned in the p1.1 vector plasmid and transfected to CHO DG44 cells. Three consecutive amplification rounds and subsequent cell cloning yielded a producer cell line with a specific productivity of 10.7 0.4 pg/cell/day. The procoagulant activity of the secreted factor IX was restored nearly completely by co-transfection of the producer cells by p1.2 plasmids bearing genes of the soluble truncated variant of human PACE/furin signal protease and vitamin K oxidoreductase from Chinese hamster. The resulting clonal cell line 3B12-86 was able to secrete factor IX in a protein-free medium up to a 6 IU/ml titer under plain batch culturing conditions. The copy number of the genome- integrated factor IX gene for the 3B12-86 cell line was only 20 copies/genome; the copy numbers of the genome-integrated genes of PACE/furin and vitamin K oxidoreductase were 3 and 2 copies/genome, respectively. Factor IX protein secreted by the 3B12-86 cell line was purified by three consecutive chromatography rounds to a specific activity of up to 230 IU/mg, with the overall yield 30%. The developed clonal producer cell line and the purification process employed in this work allow for economically sound industrial-scale production of biosimilar factor IX for hemophilia B therapy.",

Many neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by cognitive impairment associated with the dysfunction of nAChRs. The human membrane-tethered prototoxin Lynx1 modulates nAChR function in the brain areas responsible for learning and memory. In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that the β-amyloid peptide Aβ1-42 decreases Lynx1 mRNA expression in rat primary cortical neurons, and that this decrease is associated with the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, we have demonstrated that the Lynx1 expression decrease, as well as the blockade of the long-term potentiation underlying learning and memory, caused by Aβ1-42, may be prevented by incubation with a water-soluble Lynx1 analogue. Our findings suggest that the water-soluble Lynx1 analogue may be a promising agent for the improvement of cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of new chemokines that induce the migration of lymphocytes to the infection site is important for the targeted search for therapeutic agents in immunotherapy. We recently showed that Tag7 (PGLYRP1), an innate immunity protein, forms a stable complex with the Ca2+ -binding protein Mts1 (S100A4), which is able to induce lymphocyte movement, although the individual Tag7 and Mts1 do not have this activity. The purpose of this study is to identify receptors that induce the migration of lymphocytes along the concentration gradient of the Tag7-Mts1 complex, and the components of this complex capable of interacting with these receptors. The study investigated the migration of human PBMC under the action of the Tag7-Mts1complex. PBMC of healthy donors were isolated using a standard Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation procedure. It has been established that the movement of PBMC along the concentration gradient of the Tag7-Mts1 complex is induced by the classical chemotactic receptors CCR5 and CXCR3. It has been shown that only Mts1 is able to bind to the extracellular domain of CCR5, however, this binding is not enough to induce cell movement. A comparative analysis of the primary and 3D structures of the three proteins revealed the homology of the amino acid sequence fragments of the Tag7-Mts1 protein complex with different sites of the CCR5 receptor ligand - MIP1α protein. In conclusion, it should be noted that the Tag7-Mts1 complex can be considered as a new ligand of the classical chemotactic receptors CCR5 and CXCR3.",

    "abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium is a monolayer of pigmented, hexagonal cells connected by tight junctions. These cells compose part of the outer blood-retina barrier, protect the eye from excessive light, have important secretory functions, and support the function of photoreceptors, ensuring the coordination of a variety of regulatory mechanisms. It is the degeneration of the pigment epithelium that is the root cause of many retinal degenerative diseases. The search for reliable cell sources for the transplantation of retinal pigment epithelium is of extreme urgency. Pluripotent stem cells (embryonic stem or induced pluripotent) can be differentiated with high efficiency into the pigment epithelium of the retina, which opens up possibilities for cellular therapy in macular degeneration and can slow down the development of pathology and, perhaps, restore a patient's vision. Pioneering clinical trials on transplantation of retinal pigment epithelial cells differentiated from pluripotent stem cells in the United States and Japan confirmed the need for developing and optimizing such approaches to cell therapy. For effective use, pigment epithelial cells differentiated from pluripotent stem cells should have a set of functional properties characteristic of such cells in vivo. This review summarizes the current state of preclinical and clinical studies in the field of retinal pigment epithelial transplantation therapy. We also discuss different differentiation protocols based on data in the literature and our own data, and the problems holding back the widespread therapeutic application of retinal pigment epithelium differentiated from pluripotent stem cells.",

A study of 60 strains of different origins using DNA markers confirmed, and in the case for several strains, clarified their taxonomic characteristics.

The effectiveness of autophagy is ensured by a controlled interaction between two organelles - the autophagosome and the lysosome. Despite significant progress in the description of the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagic-lysosomal system (ALS) functioning, many fundamental questions remain. Namely, the specialized functions of lysosomes and the role of ALS in the pathogenesis of human diseases are still enigmatic. Understanding of the mechanisms that are triggered at all stages of autophagic- lysosomal degradation, from the initiation of autophagy to the terminal stage of substrate destruction in the lysosome, may result in new approaches that could help better uderstand ALS and, therefore, selectively control cellular proteostasis.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we showed that incorporation of methotrexate (MTX) in the form of a lipophilic prodrug (MTXDG) in 100-nm lipid bilayer liposomes of egg phosphatidylcholine can allow one to reduce toxicity and improve the antitumor efficiency of MTX in a mouse model of T-cell leukemic lymphoma. However, in our hemocompatibility tests in vitro, MTX liposomes caused complement (C) activation, obviously due to binding on the liposome surface and fragmentation of the C3 complement factor. In this work, we studied the interactions of MTX liposomes carrying stabilizing molecules phosphatidylinositol (PI), ganglioside GM1, or a lipid conjugate of N-carboxymethylated oligoglycine (CMG) in the bilayer with subpopulations of human blood leukocytes. Liposomes labeled with BODIPY-phosphatidylcholine were incubated with whole blood (30 min and 1 h, 37C), blood cells were lysed with a hypotonic buffer, and the fluorescence of the liposomes bound but not internalized by the leukocytes was quenched by crystal violet. Cell suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry. Incorporation of MTXDG dramatically enhanced the phagocytosis of liposomes of any composition by monocytes. Neutrophils consumed much less of the liposomes. Lymphocytes did not accumulate liposomes. The introduction of PI into MTX liposomes practically did not affect the specific consumption of liposomes by monocytes, while CMG was likely to increase the consumption rate regardless of the presence of MTXDG. The GM1 ganglioside presumably shielded MTX liposomes from phagocytosis by one of the monocyte populations and increased the efficiency of monocyte uptake by another population, probably one expressing C3b-binding receptors (C3b was detected on liposomes after incubation with blood plasma). MTX liposomes were shown to have different effects on TNF- production by activated leukocytes, depending on the structure of the stabilizing molecule.",

The main biological function of APE1 is to hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond on the 5'-side of the AP sites. It has been shown recently that APE1 acts as an endoribonuclease and can cleave mRNA, thereby controlling the level of some transcripts. The sequences of CA, UA, and UG dinucleotides are the cleavage sites in RNA. In the present work, we performed a comparative analysis of the cleavage efficiency of model RNA substrates with short hairpin structures in which the loop size and the location of the pyrimidine-purine dinucleotide sequence were varied. The effect of various divalent metal ions and pH on the efficiency of the endoribonuclease reaction was analyzed. It was shown that site-specific hydrolysis of model RNA substrates depends on the spatial structure of the substrate. In addition, RNA cleavage occured in the absence of divalent metal ions, which proves that hydrolysis of DNA- and RNA substrates occurs via different catalytic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is an enzyme that maintains the length of the telomere. The telomere length specifies the number of divisions a cell can undergo before it finally dies (i.e. the proliferative potential of cells). For example, telomerase is activated in embryonic cell lines and the telomere length is maintained at a constant level; therefore, these cells have an unlimited fission potential. Stem cells are characterized by a lower telomerase activity, which enables only partial compensation for the shortening of telomeres. Somatic cells are usually characterized by the absence of telomerase activity. Telomere shortening leads to the attainment of the Hayflick limit, the transition of cells to a state of senescence. The cells subsequently enter a state of crisis, accompanied by massive cell death. The surviving cells become cancer cells, which are capable both of dividing indefinitely and maintaining telomere length (usually with the aid of telomerase). Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase. It consists of two major components: telomerase RNA (TER) and reverse transcriptase (TERT). TER is a non-coding RNA, and it contains the region which serves as a template for telomere synthesis. An increasing number of articles focussing on the alternative functions of telomerase components have recently started appearing. The present review summarizes data on the structure, biogenesis, and functions of telomerase.",

Currently, there is no sufficient or appropriate treatment to counteract these adenovirus infections. Thus, there is an urgent need for new etiology-directed therapies with selective activity against human adenoviruses. To address this problem, the adenoviral early genes E1A and E2B (viral DNA polymerase) seem to be promising targets. Here, we propose an effective approach to downregulate the replication of human species D adenoviruses by means of RNA interference. We generated E1A expressing model cell lines enabling fast evaluation of the RNA interference potential. Small interfering RNAs complementary to the E1A mRNA sequences of human species D adenoviruses mediate significant suppression of the E1A expression in model cells. Furthermore, we observed a strong downregulation of replication of human adenoviruses type D8 and D37 by small hairpin RNAs complementary to the E1A or E2B mRNA sequences in primary human limbal cells. We believe that our results will contribute to the development of efficient anti-adenoviral therapy.",

Telomerase RNA is a component of telomerase and, thus, is crucial for its activity. The structures of telomerase RNA genes and their promoter regions were compared for the long-living naked mole rat and different organisms. Two rare polymorphisms in Heterocephalus glaber telomerase RNA (hgTER) were identified: A→G in the first loop of pseudoknot P2b-p3 (an equivalent of 111nt in hTR) and G→A in the scaRNA domain CR7-p8b (an equivalent of 421nt in hTR). Analysis of TER promoter regions allowed us to identify two new transcription factor binding sites. The first one is the ETS family site, which was found to be a conserved element for all the analyzed TER promoters. The second site is unique for the promoter region of TER of the naked mole rat and is a binding site for the SOX17 transcription factor. The absence of one Sp1 site in the TER promoter region of the naked small rat is an additional specific feature of the promoter area of hgTER. Such variation in the hgTER transcription regulation region and hgTER itself could provide increased telomerase activity in stem cells and an extended lifespan to H. glaber.",

Most of the data concerning the possible instability of rearranged clonal TCR and IG genes during disease recurrence were obtained for ALL in children. The appropriate features of adult ALL, which are known to differ from those of childhood ALL in certain biological characteristics and prognosis, remain insufficiently studied. The aim of this study was to assess the stability of IG and TCR gene rearrangements in adult ALL. Rearrangements were identified according to the BIOMED-2 protocol (PCR followed by fragment analysis). Mismatch in clonal rearrangements at onset and relapse was identified in 83% of patients, indicating clonal instability during treatment. Clonal evolution and diversity of IG and TCR gene rearrangements may be one of the tumor progression mechanisms. New rearrangements may emerge due to residual VDJ-recombinase activity in tumor cells. Also, many clonal IG and TCR gene rearrangements may be present at different levels at a diagnosis, but less abundant clones may be invisible due to limited detection sensitivity. Later, major clones may disappear in the course of chemotherapy, while others may proliferate. Investigation of clonal evolution and heterogeneity in ALL and their impact on the treatment efficacy will contribute to the identification of new prognostic factors and the development of therapeutic approaches.",

[2] showed that enormous loss of muscle stiffness (atonia) develops in humans under true (space flight) and simulated microgravity conditions as early as after the first days of exposure. This phenomenon is attributed to the inactivation of slow motor units and called reflectory atonia. However, a lot of evidence indicating that even isolated muscle or a single fiber possesses substantial stiffness was published at the end of the 20th century. This intrinsic stiffness is determined by the active component, i.e. the ability to form actin-myosin cross-bridges during muscle stretch and contraction, as well as by cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins, capable of resisting muscle stretch. The main facts on intrinsic muscle stiffness under conditions of gravitational unloading are considered in this review. The data obtained in studies of humans under dry immersion and rodent hindlimb suspension is analyzed. The results and hypotheses regarding reduced probability of cross-bridge formation in an atrophying muscle due to increased interfilament spacing are described. The evidence of cytoskeletal protein (titin, nebulin, etc.) degradation during gravitational unloading is also discussed.

    "abstract": "The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) represents a challenge for global health. Since the outbreak began, the number of confirmed cases has exceeded 117 million, with more than 2.6 million deaths worldwide. With public health measures aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries have faced a crisis in the availability of intensive care units. Currently, a large-scale effort is underway to identify the nucleotide sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that is an etiological agent of COVID-19. Global sequencing of thousands of viral genomes has revealed many common genetic variants, which enables the monitoring of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the tracking of its spread over time. Understanding the current evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary not only for a retrospective analysis of the new coronavirus infection spread, but also for the development of approaches to the therapy and prophylaxis of COVID-19. In this review, we have focused on the general characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Also, we have analyzed available publications on the genetic diversity of the virus and the relationship between the diversity and the biological properties of SARS-CoV-2, such as virulence and contagiousness.",

    "abstract": "Targeting protein therapeutics to specific cells and tissues is a major challenge in modern medicine. Improving the specificity of protein therapeutic delivery will significantly enhance efficiency in drug development. One of the promising tools for protein delivery is extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are enveloped by a complex lipid bilayer. EVs are secreted by almost all cell types and possess significant advantages: biocompatibility, stability, and the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Overexpression of the vesicular stomatitis virus protein G (VSV-G) was shown to promote EV formation by the producer cell. We have developed an EV-based system for targeted delivery of protein cargoes to antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In this study, we show that attachment of a recombinant llama nanobody α-CD206 to the N-terminus of a truncated VSV-G increases the selectivity of EV cargo delivery mainly to APCs. These results highlight the outstanding technological and biomedical potential of EV-based delivery systems for correcting the immune response in patients with autoimmune, viral, and oncological diseases.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and local and systemic inflammation, including accumulation of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques and upregulation of blood cytokines (e.g., C-reactive protein (CRP)), has been known for more than 100 years. The atherosclerosis-associated inflammatory response has been traditionally considered as an immune system reaction to low-density lipoproteins. At the same time, some data have indicated a potential involvement of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the activation and progression of atherosclerosis-associated inflammation, leading to ACS. However, these data have been tangential and mainly concerned the relationship between a coronary artery disease (CAD) prognosis and the anti-CMV antibody titer. We assumed that ACS might be associated with CMV reactivation and virus release into the bloodstream. The studys aim was to test this assumption through a comparison of the plasma CMV DNA level in patients with various CAD forms and in healthy subjects. To our knowledge, no similar research has been undertaken yet. A total of 150 subjects (97 CAD patients and 53 healthy subjects) were examined. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the number of plasma CMV DNA copies. We demonstrated that the number of plasma CMV genome copies in ACS patients was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects (p = 0.01). The CMV genome copy number was correlated with the plasma CRP level (p = 0.002). These findings indicate a potential relationship between CMV activation and atherosclerosis exacerbation that, in turn, leads to the development of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Monitoring of the CMV plasma level in CAD patients may be helpful in the development of new therapeutic approaches to coronary atherosclerosis treatment.",

The last three years were especially productive in the development of new methods of DNA purification and analysis. Complete mtDNA molecules and relatively large fragments of nuclear DNA are the targets of ancient DNA studies today. Ancient DNA studies allowed us to study organisms that went extinct more than ten thousand years ago, to reconstruct their phenotypic traits and evolution. Ancient DNA analyses can help understand the development of ancient human populations and how they migrated. A new evolutionary hypothesis and reconstruction of the biota history have been re-created from recent ancient DNA data. Some peculiarities and problems specific to the study of ancient DNA were revealed, such as very limited amounts of DNA available for study, the short length of the DNA fragments, breaks and chemical modifications in DNA molecules that result in “postmortem” mutations or complete blockage of DNA replication in vitro. The same specific features of DNA analysis were revealed for specimens from complicated forensic cases that result in the lack of experimental data or interpretation problems.. Here, we list the specific features of ancient DNA methodology and describe some achievements in fundamental and applied research of ancient DNA, including our own work in the field.",

Statistics performed on reads generated by GAII and SOLiD showed that they covered 75% and 96% of the genome respectively. Short polymorphic regions were detected with comparable accuracy however, the absolute amount of them revealed by SOLiD was several times less than by GAII.

    "abstract": "This work is a report on the development of a method of hybridization analysis on DNA microarrays for the simultaneous identification and typing of carbapenemase-encoding genes. These enzymes are produced by the microorganisms that are responsible for causing infectious diseases. The method involves several steps, including DNA extraction from clinical samples and amplification of carbapenemase genes by multiplex PCR with simultaneous labelling by biotin. Following that, hybridization of the labeled PCR products with oligonucleotide probes immobilized on the surface of a nitrocellulose-based DNA microarray occurs. The biotin molecules attached to the DNA duplexes are detected by using conjugates of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, which is then quantified by colorimetric detection of the enzyme. We have designed the required oligonucleotide probes and optimized the conditions of the membrane microarray-based hybridization analysis. Our method allows to identify 7 types of carbapenemase genes belonging to the molecular classes A, B, and D, and it also allows additional typing into genetic subgroups. The microarrays have been tested with the control strains producing the carbapenemase genes which have been characterized by sequencing. The developed method of hybridization analysis was employed to investigate clinical strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., which produce carbapenemases of different classes based on phenotypic testing. All strains of Acinetobacter baumanii resistant to carbapenems were producers of two carbapenemase OXA-type genes (OXA-51, in combination with OXA-23 (1 strain), OXA-40 (5 strains), or OXA-58 (4 strains)). The metallo-β-lactamase VIM-2 type gene was detected in all Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to carbapenems. Testing of carbapenem-sensitive strains did not detect any carbapenemase genes. The microarray method for the identification of carbapenemase genes is very accurate and highly productive. It can be employed in clinical microbiological laboratories for the identification and study of carbapenemase epidemiology.",

In the first half of the 20th century, German paediatricians singled out \"syntropias,\" which are combinations of diseases with common pathophysiological mechanisms, and \"dystropias,\" which are diseases that rarely co-occur in one individual. In the present paper, syntropy/dystropy is defined as a natural generic nonrandom phenomenon with an evolutionary-genetic basis. The genes involved in the development of syntropy are called \"syntropic genes,\" whereas the genes that co-participate in pathophysiological mechanisms and prevent the co-occurrence of particular phenotypes are called \"dystropic genes.\" Prospects for studying the genetic basis of this phenomenon are highlighted. The publicly available database HuGENet can be used in order to identify syntropic genes, as will be shown as examples in an analysis of cardiovascular diseases.",

Compared to widely used BOX-PCR and ribotyping methods, our system features higher resolution allowing differentiation of closely related isolates that appear identical in BOX-PCR and ribotyping but differ in their phage sensitivity. The IS1-profiling system is less sensitive to the quality of the material and equipment used. At the same time, BOX-PCR is more universal and suitable for bacterial strain grouping and reconstruction of the low-distance phylogeny. Thus, our system represents an important supplement to the existing set of tools for bacterial strain differentiation; it is particularly valuable for a detailed investigation of highly divergent and rapidly evolving natural bacterial populations and for studies on coliphage ecology. However, some isolates could not be reliably differentiated by IS1-PCR, because of the low number of bands in their patterns. For improvement of IS1-fingerprinting characteristics, we offer to modify the system by introducing the second primer TR8834 hybridizing to the sequence of a transposase gene that is widely spread in enterobacterial genomes.",

    "abstract": "The cytotoxic properties of cytotoxins (CTs) from snake venom are mediated by their interaction with the cell membrane. The hydrophobic pattern containing the tips of loops I-III and flanked by polar residues is known to be a membrane-binding motif of CTs. However, this is not enough to explain the difference in activity among various CTs which are similar in sequence and in 3D structure. The mechanism of further CT-membrane interaction leading to pore formation and cell death still remains unknown. Published experimental data on the specific interaction between CT and low molecular weight anionic components (sulphatide) of the bilayer point to the existence of corresponding ligand binding sites on the surface of toxin molecules. In this work we study the membrane-lytic properties of CT I, CT II (Naja oxiana), and CT 4 (Naja kaouthia), which belong to different structural and functional types (P- and S-type) of CTs, by measuring the intensity of a fluorescent dye, calcein released from liposomes containing a phosphatidylserine (PS) lipid as an anionic component. Using molecular docking simulations, we find and characterize three sites in CT molecules that can potentially bind the PS polar head. Based on the data obtained, we suggest a hypothesis that CTs can specifically interact with one or more of the anionic lipids (in particular, with PS) contained in the membrane, thus facilitating the interaction between CTs and the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane.",

The currently available bioinformatic methods can sometimes correctly detect previously unknown ligand binding sites in protein structures. However, the development of universal and more efficient approaches requires a deeper understanding of the common and distinctive features of the structural organization of both functional (catalytic) and allosteric sites, the evolution of their amino acid sequences in respective protein families, and allosteric communication pathways. The CASBench benchmark set contains 91 entries related to enzymes with both catalytic and allosteric sites within their structures annotated based on the experimental information from the Allosteric Database, Catalytic Site Atlas, and Protein Data Bank. The obtained dataset can be used to benchmark the performance of existing computational approaches and develop/train perspective algorithms to search for new catalytic and regulatory sites, as well as to study the mechanisms of protein regulation on a large collection of allosteric enzymes. Establishing a relationship between the structure, function, and regulation is expected to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of action of enzymes and open up new prospects for discovering new drugs and designing more efficient biocatalysts.

This assumption is supported by confocal microscopy fluorescence imaging of α-tubulin and fibrillar actin. Mapping of the local Young's modulus of a living astrocyte showed that the stiff areas correspond to the sites where the cytoskeleton fibers are located. Thus, the data obtained indicate that AFM is a promising method to study neural cells cytoskeleton integrity and arrangement in in vitro models of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are very important both for fundamental science and for practical medicine. Despite extensive research into the causes of these diseases, clinical researchers have had very limited progress and, as of now, there is still no cure for any of these diseases. One of the main obstacles in the way of creating treatments for these disorders is the fact that their etiology and pathophysiology still remain unclear. This paper reviews results that support the so-called \"calcium hypothesis of neurodegenerative diseases.\" The calcium hypothesis states that the atrophic and degenerative processes in the neurons of AD, PD, ALS, HD, and SCA patients are accompanied by alterations in calcium homeostasis. Moreover, the calcium hypothesis states that this deregulation of calcium signaling is one of the early-stage and key processes in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Based on the results we reviewed, we conclude that the calcium channels and other proteins involved in the neuronal calcium signaling system are potential drug targets for AD, PD, ALS, HD, and SCA therapy.",

    "abstract": "The Novosvobodnaya culture is known as a Bronze Age archaeological culture in the North Caucasus region of Southern Russia. It dates back to the middle of the 4th millennium B.C. and seems to have occurred during the time of the Maikop culture. There are now two hypotheses about the emergence of the Novosvobodnaya culture. One hypothesis suggests that the Novosvobodnaya culture was a phase of the Maikop culture, whereas the other one classifies it as an independent event based on the material culture items found in graves. Comparison between Novosvobodnaya pottery and Funnelbeaker (TRB) pottery from Germany has allowed researchers to suggest that the Novosvobodnaya culture developed under the influence of Indo-European culture. Nevertheless, the origin of the Novosvobodnaya culture remains a matter of debate. We applied next-generation sequencing to study ~5000-year-old human remains from the Klady kurgan grave in Novosvobodnaya stanitsa (now the Republic of Adygea, Russia). A total of 58,771,105 reads were generated using Illumina GAIIx with a coverage depth of 13.4x over the mitochondrial (mt) DNA genome. The mtDNA haplogroup affiliation was determined as V7, suggesting a role of the TRB culture in the development of the Novosvobodnaya culture and supporting the model of sharing between Novosvobodnaya and early Indo-European cultures.",

This was analyzed by RT-PCR in microsections of the proximal tibial growth plate of bovine fetuses in relationship to expression of genes associated with chondrocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and matrix vascularization. In the resting zone the genes for extracellular matrix molecule synthesis were expressed. Extracellular matrix degrading enzymes and their inhibitors were also expressed here. Onset of proliferation involved cyclic upregulation of cell division-associated activity and reduced expression of extracellular matrix molecules. Later in the proliferative zone we noted transient expression of proteinases and their inhibitors, extracellular matrix molecules, as well as activity associated with vascularization and apoptosis. With the onset of hypertrophy expression of proteinases and their inhibitors, extracellular matrix molecules, as well as activity associated with vascularization and apoptosis were significantly upregulated. Terminal differentiation was characterized by high expression of proteinases and their inhibitors, extracellular matrix molecules, as well as activity associated with apoptosis. This study reveals the complex interrelationships of gene expression in the physis that accompany matrix assembly, resorption, chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy, vascularization and cell death while principal zones of the growth plate are characterized by a distinct signature profile of gene expression.",

Exogenous choline was shown to exhibit a presynaptic inhibitory effect on the amplitude and quantal content of EPPs for the activity of neuromuscular junction evoked by single and rhythmic stimuli. This effect was inhibited either by antagonists of 7-nAChRs, such as methyllycaconitine and -cobratoxin, or by blocking SK-type calcium-activated potassium (K Ca) channels with apamin or blocking intraterminal ryanodine receptors with ryanodine. A hypothesis was put forward that choline in mouse motoneuron nerve terminals can activate presynaptic 7-nAChRs, followed by the release of the stored calcium through ryanodine receptors and activation of SK-type KCa channels, resulting in sustained decay of the quantal content of the evoked neurotransmitter release.",

The SNPs in the MTHFR gene and the 9p21 region were not significantly associated with MI one by one but were included in several different MI-associated allelic combinations identified by multilocus analysis. Since we have not revealed nonlinear epistatic interactions between the components of the identified combinations, we postulate that the cumulative effect of genes that form a combination arises from the summation of their small independent contributions. The prognostic significance of the additive composite model built from the PCSK9, APOE, LPL, and eNOS genes as genetic markers was assessed using ROC analysis. After we included these markers in the previously published composite model of individual genetic risk of MI, the prognostic efficacy in our sample reached AUC = 0.676.

It was found that the peptide reduces the rat paw edema induced by a subcutaneous administration of histamine to the same extent as the conventional anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac. However, an assessment of the relative expression level of the cox-2 gene at the inflammation focus using real-time PCR showed that, in contrast to diclofenac, PGP does not affect the cox-2 gene expression. This is indicative of the fact that they have different mechanisms of action. We used the model of acute peritonitis induced by an intraperitoneal injection of thioglycolate to demonstrate that the inflammatory response of an organism is accompanied by increased vascular permeability in the tissues of the stomach and small intestine. Pre-administration (30 minutes before the induction of the inflammation) of PGP prevented this increase, whereby the level of vascular permeability, exudate volume in the peritoneal cavity, and the amount of the Evans Blue dye in this exudate remained at the control level. Therefore, these results suggest that the anti-inflammatory action of PGP is based on its ability to prevent an increase in vascular permeability.",

Many candidates for virotherapy are viruses pathogenic for human. During recombination of genetic material, there always exists a risk of getting a virus with an unstable genome. This problem can be solved by using natural apathogenic viruses as oncolytic agents. The Newcastle disease virus is the causative agent of contagious avian diseases. Its natural strains exhibit an antitumor effect and are considered safe for humans. As shown in earlier studies, the oncolytic properties of natural strains can be enhanced during adaptation to cell cultures, without interference in the virus genome. This study demonstrates that serial passaging increases the viral infectious titer in cancer cells. Moreover, the viability of tumor cells decreases post-infection when Newcastle disease virus strains are adapted to these cell cultures. The findings of this study complement the well-known data on the adaptation of the Newcastle disease virus to human cancer cells. Hence, it is possible to obtain a NDV strain with a more pronounced oncolytic potential during adaptation. This should be taken into account when choosing a strategy for designing anticancer drugs based on this virus.",

Three PA modifications were constructed: a secretable form (Ad-sPA), a non-secretable form (Ad-cPA), and a form with the protective antigen fused to the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G2a (Ad-PA-Fc). All these forms exhibited protective properties against Bacillus anthracis. The highest level of protection was induced by the Ad-PA-Fc recombinant adenovirus.

These models should mimic the clinical and metabolic manifestations of T1DM in humans (face validity) and be similar to T1DM in terms of the pathogenetic mechanism (construct validity). Furthermore, since HCT/Ps contain human cells, modeling of diabetes in immune-deficient animals is obligatory. Here we describe the most simplified diabetes model in Nude mice. Diabetes was induced in 31 males by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ in normal saline at a medium-to-high dose of 150 mg/kg body weight. Fourteen control animals received only saline. Non-fasting plasma glucose (PG) levels were measured periodically for 50 days. All STZ-treated mice survived beyond 50 days. By day 15 after STZ administration, 22 of 31 (71%) mice developed stable diabetes based on the following criteria: (1) non-fasting PG 15 mmol/L on consecutive measurements up until day 50; (2) no diabetes remission. The mean non-fasting PG in mice with stable diabetes over the period of 35 days was equal to 25.7 mmol/L. On day 50, mean plasma insulin concentration, mean pancreatic insulin content, and the average number of -cells in pancreatic islets were 2.6, 8.4, and 50 times lower, respectively, than in the control animals.

Chemiluminescence accompanying free radical reactions involving lipids has been the extensively studied reaction. These reactions are one of the key causes of cell death by either apoptosis (activation of the cytochrome c complex with cardiolipin) or ferroptosis (induced by free ferrous ions). The concept of chemiluminescence quantum yield is also discussed in this article. The second part, which is to be published in the next issue, analyzes the application of chemiluminescence detection using luminescent additives that are called activators, a.k.a. chemiluminescence enhancers, and enhance the emission through the triplet-singlet transfer of electron excitation energy from radical reaction products, followed by light emission with a high quantum yield.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is known to use the transcriptional machinery of the host cell for viral gene transcription, and the only viral protein that partakes in this process is Tat, the viral trans-activator of transcription. During acute infection, the binding of Tat to the hairpin at the beginning of the transcribed viral RNA recruits the PTEFb complex, which in turn hyperphosphorylates RNA-polymerase II and stimulates transcription elongation. Along with acute infection, HIV-1 can also lead to latent infection that is characterized by a low level of viral transcription. During the maintenance and reversal of latency, there are no detectable amounts of Tat protein in the cell and the mechanism of transcription activation in the absence of Tat protein remains unclear. The latency maintenance is also a problematic question. It seems evident that cellular proteins with a yet unknown nature or role regulate both transcriptional repression in the latent phase and its activation during transition into the lytic phase. The present review discusses the role of cellular proteins Ku and HMGA1 in the initiation of transcription elongation of the HIV-1 provirus. The review presents data regarding Ku-mediated HIV-1 transcription and its dependence on the promoter structure and the shape of viral DNA. We also describe the differential influence of the HMGA1 protein on the induced and basal transcription of HIV-1. Finally, we offer possible mechanisms for Ku and HMGA1 proteins in the proviral transcription regulation.",

A quantitative description of the modifying action of flavonoids, muscle relaxants, thyroid hormones, and xanthene dyes is shown as the ratio of the maximum change in the bilayer dipole potential upon saturation and the absolute d value of the unmodified membrane. The slopes of the linear relationship between the increase in the dipole potential of phospholipid bilayers and the concentration of styrylpyridinium dyes in membrane-bathing solutions were found. We described the relationships between the change in d and the chemical structure of modifiers, as well as the charge and spontaneous curvature of lipid monolayers.",

    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are widely distributed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems of vertebrates. The pharmacology of these receptors remains poorly investigated, while the search for new ASIC modulators is very important. Recently, we found that some monoamines, which are blockers of NMDA receptors, inhibit and/or potentiate acid-sensing ion channels, depending on the subunit composition of the channels. The effect of 9-aminoacridine, IEM-1921, IEM-2117, and memantine both on native receptors and on recombinant ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC3 homomers was studied. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of these four compounds on homomeric ASIC1b channels. Experiments were performed on recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Only two compounds, 9-aminoacridine and memantine, inhibited ASIC1b channels. IEM-1921 and IEM-2117 were inactive even at a 1000 M concentration. In most aspects, the effect of the compounds on ASIC1b was similar to their effect on ASIC1a. The distinguishing feature of homomeric ASIC1b channels is a steep activation-dependence, indicating cooperative activation by protons. In our experiments, the curve of the concentration dependence of ASIC1b inhibition by 9-aminoacridine also had a slope (Hill coefficient) of 3.8, unlike ASIC1a homomers, for which the Hill coefficient was close to 1. This finding indicates that the inhibitory effect of 9-aminoacridine is associated with changes in the activation properties of acid-sensing ion channels.",

Apart from rare exceptions, telomerase is not active in the somatic cells and tissues of the human body. However, the activation of telomerase activity in cancer cells was shown for certain in 80–90 % of cases. understanding the mechanism of telomerase functioning and the mechanisms of its regulation could be used in oncodiagnostics. telomerase itself and its regulators could be important targets for anticancer therapy. the activity of telomerase in a cell is affected by proteins with multiple functions, and this influence is not necessarily specific. there are also cases when telomerase regulators act together or when several regulators are organised in the cascade. the aim of this review is to generalize and systemize data about the regulation of telomerase in ontogenesis.

    "abstract": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) belongs to a group of autoimmune diseases affecting the axial skeleton. Beside the hla-b*27 allele, several other human genes that control the variety processes of immune homeostasis are considered to be associated with AS manifestation in different human populations. Among strong associated non-MHC genes erap 1 encoding the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 isoform was recently identified by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) meta analysis. In our study we inspected the genetic association of five non-synonymous coding SNPs from erapl with AS in Caucasians. We implemented the SSP-PCR system for precise genotyping of 87 hla-b*27 positive AS patients and 77 hla-b*27 healthy donors from the Russian population. Considerable differences in allele’s frequencies within patients vs control cohort were shown for 3 of 5 SNPs under investigation. Using the EM-algorhitm we reconstructed 3-marker haplotypes that distinguish with high probability two cohorts due to differences in the haplotypes frequencies. In such a way both the sensitive, CCT, haplotype and the protective, TTC, one were predicted. To verify the calculation we determined genuine frequencies of 5-marker haplotypes in AS cohort by haplotyping of individual cDNA samples using improved SSP-PCR primer set. We demonstrated that the frequencies of in silica reconstucted haplotypes and the frequencies of experimentally detected haplotypes are in a good agreement. Frequency of the risk haplotype CCT (rs17482078/10050860/2287987) detected within AS cohort reaches 88%, as well as the frequency calculated by EM-algorhitm.",

Despite the obvious association between hypertension and the clinical and neuroimaging features of cerebral microangiopathy (CMA) (also known as cerebral small vessel disease), the causal links between them remain ambiguous.

Knowledge about the key factors and mechanisms involved in HT and CMA development is important for predicting the risk of cerebral complications and developing new approaches to their prevention and treatment. At present, genome-wide association studies and other approaches are used to investigate the common hereditary mechanisms of HT and CMA development, which will explain a large number of CMA cases not associated with hypertension, lack of a correlation between HT severity and the degree of cerebral injury, and failure of antihypertensive therapy to prevent CMA progression.

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells play a major role in the development of inflammation and neoangiogenesis in cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. In 3D cultures, cells are under conditions that closely resemble those existing in healthy and disease-stricken human organs and tissues. Therefore, the development of a 3D model based on the Ea.hy926 endothelial cell line is an urgent need in molecular and cellular biology. Cell cultivation on an anti-adhesive substrate under static conditions was shown to lead to the formation of spheroids (3D cultures). Expression of ICAM-1 and VEGFR-2 and production of cytokines were screened in 2D and 3D cultures in the presence of TNF and VEGF. According to flow cytometry and confocal microscopy data, TNF significantly increased the expression of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in both 2D and 3D cultures but did not affect the expression level of VEGFR-2. Increased production of pro-inflammatory (IL-8, IL-6, IP-10) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, TGF-β 1-3) factors was observed in spontaneous 3D cultures but not in 2D cultures, which was confirmed by flow cytometry and qPCR. TNF-induced secretion of IL-10, GM-CSF, and IL-6 was 11-, 4.7-, and 1.6-fold higher, respectively, in 3D cultures compared to 2D cultures. Thus, the use of a Ea.hy926 3D cell culture is a promising approach in studying the effects of anti- and pro-inflammatory agents on endothelial cells.",

Next, we investigated the prophylactic antiviral effect of Immunomax in both a model of mouse respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and a model of RSV-induced bronchial asthma (BA) exacerbation. In the experiment with RSV-induced BA exacerbation, Immunomax-treated mice were characterized by a significant decrease of the viral load in lung homogenates, an increased amount of M1 macrophages in the lung, a tendency toward Th2-dependent ovalbumin-specific IgG1 antibodies decrease in blood serum, a significant increase in RSV-activated CD4+ T cells secreting IFNγ (Th1 cells), and a simultaneous significant decrease in the amount of CD4+ cells secreting IL-4 (Th2 cells) in the mouse spleen, which were detected by ELISPOT 1.5 months after experiment. These findings suggest that treatment with the TLR4 agonist Immunomax polarizes the immune response towards antiviral Th1 and may be used for short-term antiviral prophylaxis to prevent acute respiratory viral infections in asthmatics.",

As activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), AICAR has a broad therapeutic potential, since it normalizes the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells. The synthesis of AICAR in Bacillus subtilis cells is controlled by the enzymes of purine biosynthesis; their genes constituting purine operon (pur-operon). Reconstruction of purine metabolism in B. subtilis was performed to achieve overproduction of AICAR. For this purpose, the gene purH, which encodes formyltransferase/IMP-cyclohydrolase, an enzyme that controls the conversion of AICAR to IMP, was removed from the B. subtilis genome, ensuring the accumulation of AICAR. An insertion inactivating the gene purR that encodes the negative transcriptional regulator of the purine biosynthesis operon was introduced into the B.subtilis chromosome in order to boost the production of AICAR; the transcription attenuator located in the leader sequence of pur-operon was deleted. Furthermore, the expression integrative vector carrying a strong promoter of the rpsF gene encoding the ribosomal protein S6 was designed. The heterologous Escherichia coli gene purF encoding the first enzyme of the biosynthesis of purines with impaired allosteric regulation, as well as the modified E.coli gene prs responsible for the synthesis of the precursor of purines - phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) - was cloned into this vector under the control of the rpsF gene promoter. The modified purF and prs genes were inserted into the chromosome of the B. subtilis strain.

The effect of vitamin E succinate on human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 was investigated in this study using live imaging, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. α-Tocopheryl succinate-induced apoptotic cell death in A431 cells was shown to be both dose- and time-dependent. The hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species, changes in size, shape and ultrastructural characteristics of mitochondria followed by the release of cytochromecfrom mitochondria to cytosol were observed. These results suggest that α-tocopheryl succinate induces apoptosis that occurs via the mitochondrial pathway. Mitochondria are shown to be crucial targets in α-tocopheryl succinate-induced caspase-dependent cell death in human carcinoma A431 cells.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptors are the essential components of innate immunity. It is shown that TLRs play an essential role in the immune resistance of an organism to bacterial and viral infections. The binding of TLR to its own ligands results in the activation of several adapter molecules and kinases, inducing the activation of the main pro-inflammatory transcriptional factors, which in turn induce the activation of the main pro-inflammatory transcriptional factors. This activation results in the development of both the innate immune response triggered by the enhanced expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides and that of the adaptive immune response, via the activation of dendritic cells and enhancement of antigen presentation, etc. The ability of TLR agonists to bolster the immune reaction makes them promising for use in the therapy of infectious diseases and in the chemotherapy of malignant neoformations. However, different TLR ligands may have either antitumor activity (lipopolysaccharide, imiquimod, CpG) or, conversely, could beef up the resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis, stimulating their proliferation under certain conditions (lipopolysaccharide, lipopeptide). It has been shown that the TLR2-dependent signalling pathway in the myelomonocytic mouse leukaemia cell line WEHI-3B leads to the constitutive activation of the transcriptional factor NF-kB, suppression of apoptosis in tumor cells, and progression of myelomonocytic mouse leukaemia in vivo, upon the addition of TLR2 agonist (synthetic lipopeptide Pam2CSK4) or following the infection of tumor cells with Mycoplasma arginini.",

Recombinant factor VIII, which is produced in CHO or BHK cells, is equivalent to the plasma-derived one and is prevalent in current clinical practice in developed countries. Development of a biosimilar recombinant FVIII requires the creation of a highly productive clonal cell line and generation of monoclonal antibodies suitable for affinity purification of the product. Methotrexate-driven transgene amplification of genetic cassettes that code full-length and truncated variants of FVIII under the control of the CMV promoter was studied. It was shown that the expression level of the truncated variant of FVIII is 6.5 times higher than that of the full-length molecule. The transgene amplification procedure was sufficient for a twofold increase of the expression level in the transfected cells pool and subsequent selection of the clonal line, stably producing truncated FVIII at the level of 0.52 IU/ml during cultivation in a chemically defined protein-free culture medium. Four generated mouse monoclonal antibodies toward the heavy chain of FVIII were found suitable for binding the truncated variant of FVIII directly from the conditioned medium and elution of the FVIII with a more than 85% yield and normal pro-coagulant activity. The producer cell line and monoclonal antibodies obtained are sufficient for the development of upstream and downstream processes of biosimilar FVIII production. Generation of more productive cell lines by the use of stronger, nonviral promoters and shorter cDNA of FVIII will be the subject of further studies.",

The inhibitory effect demonstrates the possibility of preventing the depletion of a significant portion of functionally important immune cells. A comparative study of infection inhibition in individual cell pools has allowed us to reveal the differences in the preparations effectiveness in each of the cell populations. A R5-tropic HIV-1 infection in macrophages exhibited maximum sensitivity to the preparation: 90% and 50% inhibition of the infection were observed in the presence of concentrations as low as 1.4 and 0.35 g/ml, respectively. A 15- and 19-fold higher concentration was required to achieve the same extent of inhibition in dendritic cells infected with the same strain. The effectiveness of the drug in CD4 + T lymphocytes is quite comparable to its effectiveness in macrophages. The drug is universally effective for both the T- and M-tropic variants of HIV-1.",

In contrast to mouse pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), the status of X chromosome inactivation in human PSCs may vary significantly. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a whole X-chromosome- specific DNA probe revealed that late-replicating Xi may occupy either compact or dispersed territory in human PSCs. Thus, the late replication of the Xi does not depend on the compactness of chromosome territory in human PSCs.

The antiviral potential of KS-6469 against the influenza virus was evaluated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney epithelial cells treated with serially diluted KS-6469. We found out that KS-6469 completely inhibited viral reproduction after treatment of the infected cells with the compound for 48 h.

This recognition includes the movement of sperm in the gradient of egg chemoattractants, destruction of the egg envelope by acrosomal proteins, etc. Gametic incompatibility is one of the mechanisms of reproductive isolation. It is based on species-specific molecular interactions that prevent heterospecific fertilization. Although gametic incompatibility may occur in any sexually reproducing organism, it has been studied only in a few model species. Gamete interactions in different taxa involve generally similar processes, but they often employ non-homologous molecules. Gamete recognition proteins evolve rapidly, like immunity proteins, and include many taxon-specific families. In fact, recently appeared proteins particularly contribute to reproductive isolation via gametic incompatibility. Thus, we can assume a multiple, independent origin of this type of reproductive isolation throughout animal evolution. Gametic incompatibility can be achieved at any fertilization stage and entails different consequences at different taxonomic levels and ranges, from complete incompatibility between closely related species to partial incompatibility between distantly related taxa.",

The role of the proteases and proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization is being actively studied. However, there are no published data on the relationship between the mRNA expression levels of calpains 1/2 (CAPN 1/2) and the proteins associated with cytoskeleton remodeling. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to establish the relationship between the mRNA expression levels of CAPN 1/2 and the proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, such as cell motility markers (SNAI1, VIM, and RND3) and actin-binding proteins (CFN1, PFN1, EZR, FSCN1, and CAP1) using the model of laryngeal/laryngopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LC). The gene expression level was determined by reverse transcriptase real-time PCR and calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method in paired tissue samples of 44 patients with LC (T1-4N0-2M0). The patients were divided into two groups: those with low and those with high CAPN 1/2 expression levels. It was found that metastasis in LC patients was associated with decreased expression levels of VIM and CAP1, and increased levels of CAPN1. A high level of CAPN2 was accompanied by a high expression level of EZR, indicating the activation of invasion processes. The results obtained need to be confirmed in further studies using a larger sample of patients and target genes. Our study is important in elucidating the mechanisms that underlie cancer progression and metastasis, a development that could subsequently open the way to a search for new prognostic and predictive markers of laryngeal/laryngopharyngeal cancer progression.",

Our UCNPs had photoluminescence emission maxima inthe visible and infrared spectral regions, which allow for deep optical imaging of tumor cells in the brain. Moreover, we evaluated the toxicity effects of our UCNPs on a normal brain and glioma cells. It was revealed thatour UCNPs are non-toxic to glioma cells but have a moderate cytotoxic effect on primary neuronal cultures at high concentrations, a condition that is characterized by a decreased cellular viability and changes in thefunctional metabolic activity of neuron-glial networks. Despite the great potential associated with the use of these UCNPs as fluorescent markers, there is a need for further studies on the rate of the UCNPsaccumulation and excretion in normal and tumor brain cells, and the use of their surface modifications in order to reduce their cytotoxic effects.",

However, a number of recent studies have challenged the notion that the activity of RNases in the manifestation of selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells is exclusively an enzymatic one. In this review, we have analyzed available data on the cytotoxic effects of secreted RNases, which are not associated with their catalytic activity, and we have provided evidence that the most important factor in the selective apoptosis-inducing action of RNases is the structural organization of these enzymes, which determines how they interact with cell components.

    "abstract": "Melanoma is one of the most aggressive tumors. It develops from pigment-forming cells (melanocytes) and results in a high number of lethal outcomes. The use of genetic constructs with the ability to specifically kill melanoma cells, but not normal cells, might increase the lifespan of patients, as well as improve their quality of life. One of the methods to achieve a selective impact for therapeutic genes on cancer cells is to utilize a transcriptional control mechanism using promoters that are specifically activated only in cancerous cells. In this review, promoters of the genes that are preferentially expressed in melanoma cells are described. These promoters, and other highly melanoma-specific regulatory elements, reduce the unspecific expression of therapeutic genes in normal tissues. Moreover, cancer-specific promoters and their elements are advantageous for the development of universal anticancer drugs. Examples of the use of double promoters that have a high potential as instruments in cancer gene therapy are also given in this review.",

    "abstract": "Type 3 muscarinic receptors (M3 receptors) participate in the mediation of cholinergic effects in mammalian myocardium, along with M2 receptors. However, myocardium of adult mammals demonstrates only modest electrophysiological effects in response to selective stimulation of M3 receptors which are hardly comparable to the effects produced by M2 stimulation. In the present study, the effects of selective M3 stimulation induced by application of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (10 M) in the presence of the selective M2 blocker methoctramine (100 nM) on the action potential (AP) waveform were investigated in isolated atrial and ventricular preparations from newborn and 3-week-old rats and compared to those in preparations from adult rats. In the atrial myocardium, stimulation of M3 receptors produced a comparable reduction of AP duration in newborn and adult rats, while in 3-week-old rats the effect was negligible. In ventricular myocardial preparations from newborn rats, the effect of M3 stimulation was more than 3 times stronger compared to that from adult rats, while preparations from 3-week old rats demonstrated no definite effect, similarly to atrial preparations. In all studied types of cardiac preparations, the effects of M3 stimulation were eliminated by the selective M3 antagonist 4-DAMP (10 nM). The results of RT-PCR show that the amount of product of the M3 receptor gene decreases with the maturation of animals both in atrial and ventricular myocardium. We concluded that the contribution of M3 receptors to the mediation of cardiac cholinergic responses decreases during postnatal ontogenesis. These age-related changes may be associated with downregulation of M3 receptor gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is one of the major components of the telomeres -- linear eukaryotic chromosome ends - maintenance system. Linear chromosomes are shortened during each cell division due to the removal of the primer used for DNA replication. Special repeated telomere sequences at the very ends of linear chromosomes prevent the deletion of genome information caused by primer removal. Telomeres are shortened at each replication round until it becomes critically short and is no longer able to protect the chromosome in somatic cells. At this stage, a cell undergoes a crisis and usually dies. Rare cases result in telomerase activation, and the cell gains unlimited proliferative capacity. Special types of cells, such as stem, germ, embryonic cells and cells from tissues with a high proliferative potential, maintain their telomerase activity indefinitely. The telomerase is inactive in the majority of somatic cells. Telomerase activity in vitro requires two key components: telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomerase RNA. In cancer cells, telomerase reactivates due to the expression of the reverse transcriptase gene. Telomerase RNA expresses constitutively in the majority of human cells. This fact suggests that there are alternative functions to telomerase RNA that are unknown at the moment. In this manuscript, we review the biogenesis of yeasts and human telomerase RNAs thanks to breakthroughs achieved in research on telomerase RNA processing by different yeasts species and humans in the last several years.",

It has been demonstrated that with the use of a high concentration of fenoterol (in the range of 1-50 µM), there is a more significant positive inotropic effect observed within a shorter period of time. In the case of relatively low doses of fenoterol (1 and 5 µM), its contractility effects are observed 20 min after the application of agonist, whereby in the case of high concentrations (25, 50 and 300 µM), the effects appear within the first minutes. During the first 10-15 min, 5 µM fenoterol causes an increase in the amplitude of Ca-signals in cardiomyocytes (this indicates an increase in the concentration of Ca ions during systole) and the activation of NO synthesis. However, after 20 min, the production of NO decreases; while the amplitude of Ca-signals remains high. The application of 50 µM fenoterol leads to a rapid increase in the amplitude of Ca-signals: at the same time, it causes a decrease in the production of NO, which we found to begin to increase after 10 min of agonist application. It is suggested that the dynamics of the positive inotropic effect occurring under pharmacological stimulation of β(2)-adrenoreceptors depend on the rate of increase in the amplitude of Ca-signals and on the degree of NO synthesis.",

The aim of the present work was to study the long-lasting effects of chronic neonatal stress in white rats and to estimate the possibility of their correction using Semax, an analogue of ACTH fragment (4-10). Early neonatal isolation was used as a model of early-life stress. Rat pups were separated from their mothers and littermates for 5 h daily during postnatal days 1-14. The pups of the control group were left undisturbed with the dams. Half of the rats subjected to neonatal isolation received an intranasal injection of Semax at a dose of 50 g/kg daily, from postnatal day 15 until day 28. The other animals received intranasal vehicle injections daily at the same time points. It was shown that neonatal isolation leads to a delay in physical development, metabolic disturbances, and a decrease in the corticosterone stress response in white rats. These changes were observed during the first two months of life. Semax administration weakened the influence of neonatal isolation on the animals, body weight , reduced metabolic dysfunction, and led to an increase in stress-induced corticosterone release to the control values. So the chronic intranasal administration of Semax after termination of the neonatal isolation procedure diminishes the negative effects of neonatal stress.",

In the current study, we demonstrate for the first time that the over-expression of Rabin8, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab8 GTPase, suppresses phosphorylation of Ser235/Ser236 in ribosomal protein S6. Downregulation of Rabin8 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) increases the phosphorylation of Ser235/Ser236 in ribosomal protein S6. Furthermore, Rabin8 can be immunoprecipitated with Rheb GTPase. These results suggest the existence of a novel mechanism of mTORC1 regulation and its downstream processes.

The toxicity of HER2-targeted immunotoxin 4D5scFv-PE40 against spheroids was shown to be several orders of magnitude lower compared to a monolayer cell culture. The significant difference in the severity of the immunotoxin effect can be explained by the fact that it ineffectively penetrates the spheroid and predominantly influences the cells of the outer layers.

The goal of this study is to propose animal models of photoreceptor degeneration that are easier to obtain than knockout mouse models but include the main features required for testing the physiological activity of molecular photoswitches. Two amphibian-based models were proposed. The first model was obtained by mechanical deletion of the photoreceptor outer segments. The second model was obtained by intraocular injection of tunicamycin to induce the degeneration of rods and cones. To test our models, we used 2-[(4-{(E)-[4-(acryloylaminophenyl]diazenyl}phenyl)amino]-N,N,N-triethyl-2-oxoethanammonium chloride (AAQ), one of the compounds that have been studied in other physiological models. The electroretinograms recorded from our models before and after AAQ treatment are in agreement with the results obtained on knockout mouse models and reported in other studies. Hence, the proposed models can be used for primary screening of molecular photochromic ion channel blockers.",

Spermine oxidase (SMOX) is the key and most recently discovered enzyme of polyamine metabolism that plays an essential role in regulating polyamine homeostasis by catalyzing the back-conversion of Spm to Spd. The development of many types of epithelial cancer is associated with inflammation, and disease-related inflammatory stimuli induce SMOX. MDL72527 is widely used in vitro and in vivo as an irreversible inhibitor of SMOX, but it is also potent towards N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase. Although SMOX has high substrate specificity, Spm analogues have not been systematically studied as enzyme inhibitors. Here we demonstrate that 1,12-diamino-2,11-bis(methylidene)-4,9-diazadodecane (2,11-Met2-Spm) has, under standard assay conditions, an IC50 value of 169 μM towards SMOX and is an interesting instrument and lead compound for studying polyamine catabolism.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease outbreak in 2019 (COVID-19) has now achieved the level of a global pandemic and affected more than 100 million people on all five continents and caused over 2 million deaths. Russia is, needless to say, among the countries affected by SARS-CoV-2, and its health authorities have mobilized significant efforts and resources to fight the disease. The paper presents the result of a functional analysis of 155 patients in the Moscow Region who were examined at the Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian Academy of Sciences during the first wave of the pandemic (FebruaryJuly, 2020). The inclusion criteria were a positive PCR test and typical, computed tomographic findings of viral pneumonia in the form of ground-glass opacities. A clinical correlation analysis was performed in four groups of patients: (1) those who were not on mechanical ventilation, (2) those who were on mechanical ventilation, and (3) those who subsequently recovered or (4) died. The correlation analysis also considered confounding comorbidities (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, etc.). The immunological status of the patients was examined (levels of immunoglobulins of the M, A, G classes and their subclasses, as well as the total immunoglobulin level) using an original SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA kit. The ELISA kit was developed using linear S-protein RBD-SD1 and NTD fragments, as well as the N-protein, as antigens. These antigens were produced in the prokaryotic E. coli system. Recombinant RBD produced in the eukaryotic CHO system (RBD CHO) was used as an antigen representing conformational RBD epitopes. The immunoglobulin A level was found to be the earliest serological criterion for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and it yielded the best sensitivity and diagnostic significance of ELISA compared to that of class M immunoglobulin. We demonstrated that the seroconversion rate of early N-protein-specific IgM and IgA antibodies is comparable to that of antibodies specific to RBD conformational epitopes. At the same time, seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein-specific class G immunoglobulins was significantly faster compared to that of other specific antibodies. Our findings suggest that the strong immunogenicity of the RBD fragment is for the most part associated with its conformational epitopes, while the linear RBD and NTD epitopes have the least immunogenicity. An analysis of the occurrence rate of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins of different classes revealed that RBD- and N-specific antibodies should be evaluated in parallel to improve the sensitivity of ELISA. An analysis of the immunoglobulin subclass distribution in sera of seropositive patients revealed uniform induction of N-protein-specific IgG subclasses G1G4 and IgA subclasses A1A2 in groups of patients with varying severity of COVID-19. In the case of the S-protein, G1, G3, and A1 were the main subclasses of antibodies involved in the immune response.",

S78A and S270A substitutions have resulted in dramatic destabilization of the enzyme. Mutant enzymes were inactivated during isolation from cells. Another six mutant TvDAAOs have been highly purified and their properties have been characterized. The amino acid substitutions S277A and S336A destabilized the protein globule. The thermal stabilities of TvDAAO S77A and TvDAAO S335A mutants were close to that of the wild-type enzyme, while S67A and S105A substitutions resulted in approximately 1.5- and 2.0-fold increases in the TvDAAO mutant thermal stability, respectively. Furthermore, the TvDAAO S105A mutant showed on average a 1.2- to 3.0-fold higher catalytic efficiency with D-Asn, D-Tyr, D-Phe, and D-Leu as compared to the wild-type enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Replication-defective adenoviral vectors are effective molecular tools for both gene therapy and gene vaccination. Using such vectors one can deliver and express target genes in different epithelial, liver, hematopoietic and immune system cells of animal and human origin. The success of gene therapy and gene vaccination depends on the production intensity of the target protein encoded by the transgene. In this work, we studied influence of Toll-like receptors (TLR) agonists on transduction and expression efficacy of adenoviral vectors in animal and human antigen-presenting cells. We found that agonists of TLR2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 significantly enhance a production of the target protein in cells transduced with adenoviral vector having the target gene insert. The enhancement was observed in dendritic cells and macrophages expressing cytoplasmic (GFP), membrane (HA) or secretory (SEAP) proteins encoded by the respective rAd-vectors. Experiments in mice showed that enhancement of the transgene expression can be achieved in the organism of animals using a pharmaceutical-grade TLR4-agonist. In contrast to other TLR-agonists, the agonist of TLR3 substantially suppressed the expression of transgene in cells transduced with adenoviral vectors having insert of GFP or SEAP target genes. We propose that the enhancement of transgene expression is linked to the activation of MyD88 NF-kB, while the inhibition of transgene expression depends on TRIF IRF signaling pathways. Both of these pathways jointly exploited by TLR4-agonists lead to the enhancement of transgene expression due to the dominant role of the MyD88 NF-kB signaling.",

The approach is based on the numerical decomposition of the free energy profiles of the transmembrane (TM) helices into components corresponding to protein-protein, protein-lipid, and protein-water interactions. The method was tested for the TM segments of human glycophorin A (GpA) and two mutant forms, Gly83Ala and Thr87Val. It was shown that lipids make a significant negative contribution to the free energy of dimerization, while amino acid residues forming the interface of the helix-helix contact may be unfavorable in terms of free energy. The detailed balance between different energy contributions is highly dependent on the amino acid sequence of the TM protein segment. The results show the dominant role of the environment in the interaction of membrane proteins that is changing our notion of the driving force behind the spontaneous association of TM -helices. Adequate estimation of the contribution of the water-lipid environment thus becomes an extremely urgent task for a rational design of new molecules targeting bitopic membrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases.",

    "abstract": "Vaccination has been successfully used to prevent influenza for a long time. Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), which induces a humoral immune response in humans and protection against the flu, is the main antigenic component of modern influenza vaccines. However, new seasonal and pandemic influenza virus variants with altered structures of HA occasionally occur. This allows the pathogen to avoid neutralization with antibodies produced in response to previous vaccination. Development of a vaccine with the new variants of HA acting as antigens takes a long time. Therefore, during an epidemic, it is important to have passive immunization agents to prevent and treat influenza, which can be monoclonal or single-domain antibodies with universal specificity (broad-spectrum agents). We considered antibodies to conserved epitopes of influenza virus antigens as universal ones. In this paper, we tried to characterize the main B-cell epitopes of hemagglutinin and analyze our own and literature data on broadly neutralizing antibodies. We conducted a computer analysis of the best known conformational epitopes of influenza virus HAs using materials of different databases. The analysis showed that the core of the HA molecule, whose antibodies demonstrate pronounced heterosubtypic activity, can be used as a target for the search for and development of broad-spectrum antibodies to the influenza virus.",

This approach has allowed researchers to study the evolutionary changes that occur in different populations and determine the influence of the environment on genetic selection. However, the improvement of methodological approaches to genome-wide analysis has opened up new possibilities in the search for the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression. It was discovered recently that the methylation status of the regulatory elements of the HOXD cluster and MEIS1 gene changed during human evolution. Epigenetic changes in these genes played a key role in the evolution of the limbs of modern humans. Recent works have demonstrated that it is possible to determine the transcriptional activity of genes in ancient DNA samples by combining information on DNA methylation and the DNAaseI hypersensitive sequences located at the transcription start sites of genes. In the nearest future, if a preserved fossils brain is found, it will be possible to identify the evolutionary changes in the higher nervous system associated with epigenetic differences.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis, the main factor in the development of coronary heart diseases (CHD), is an inflammatory response to endothelial layer damage in the arterial bed. We have analyzed the association between CHD and the polymorphic markers of genes that control the synthesis of proteins involved in the processes of adhesion and chemotaxis of immunocompetent cells: rs1024611 (-2518A>G, CCL2 gene), rs1799864 (V64I, CCR2 gene), rs3732378 (T280M, CX3CR1 gene), rs1136743 (A70V, SAA1 gene), and rs1205 (2042C>T, CRP gene) in 217 patients with CHD and 250 controls. Using the Monte Carlo method and Markov chains (APSampler), we revealed a combination of alleles/genotypes associated with both a reduced and increased risk of CHD. The most significant alleles/genotypes areSAA1*T/T+CRP*C+CX3CR1*G/A (P perm = 0.0056, OR = 0.07 95%CI 0.009-0.55), SAA1*T+CRP*T+CCR2*G/A+CX3CR1*G (P perm = 0.0063, OR = 14.58 95%CI 1.88-113.04), SAA1*T+CCR2*A+CCL2* G/G (P perm = 0.0351, OR = 10.77 95%CI 1.35-85.74).",

The ribT gene nucleotide sequence was amplified and cloned into the standard high-copy expression vector pET15b and then expressed after induction with IPTG in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain cells containing the inducible phage T7 RNA polymerase gene. The ribT gene expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The protein product of the expression was purified by affinity chromatography. Therefore, the real possibility of RibT protein production in quantities sufficient for further investigation of its structure and functional activity was demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the main way to fight cancer is still chemotherapy. This method of treatment is at the height of its capacity, so, setting aside the need for further improvements in traditional treatments for neoplasia, it is vital to develop now approaches toward treating malignant tumors. This paper reviews innovational experimental approaches to treating malignant malformations based on the use of gene-targeted drugs, such as antisense oligonucleotides (asON), small interfering RN A (siRN A), ribozymes, and DNAzymes, which can all inhibit oncogene expression. The target genes for these drugs are thoroughly characterized, and the main results from pre-clinical and first-step clinical trials of these drugs are presented. It is shown that the gene-targeted oligonucleotides show considerable variations in their effect on tumor tissue, depending on the target gene in question. The effects range from slowing and stopping the proliferation of tumor cells to suppressing their invasive capabilities. Despite their similarity, not all the antisense drugs targeting the same region of the mRN A of the target-gene were equally effective. The result is determined by the combination of the drug type used and the region of the target-gene mRN A that it complements.",

Current knowledge on the impact of naturally occurring bacteriophages on the populations of their host bacteria, and their role in the homeostasis maintenance of a macro host, is still sketchy. The existing data suggest that different mechanisms stabilize phage-bacteria coexistence in different animal species or different body sites. The defining set of parameters governing phage infection includes specific physical, chemical, and biological conditions, such as pH, nutrient densities, host prevalence, relation to mucosa and other surfaces, the presence of phage inhibiting substances, etc. Phage therapy is also an ecological process that always implies three components that form a complex pattern of interactions: populations of the pathogen, the bacteriophages used as antibacterial agents, and the macroorganism. We present a review of contemporary data on natural bacteriophages occuring in human- and animal-body associated microbial communities, and analyze ecological and physiological considerations that determine the success of phage therapy in mammals.",

    "abstract": "In clinical medicine, the phenomenon of polypathy, as a particular object of investigation, was first put forth by French clinicians at the end of the 19th century through the “arthritismus” doctrine. In the first half of the 20th century, German paediatricians singled out “syntropias,” which are combinations of diseases with common pathophysiological mechanisms, and “dystropias,” which are diseases that rarely co-occur in one individual. In the present paper, syntropy/dystropy is defined as a natural generic nonrandom phenomenon with an evolutionary-genetic basis. The genes involved in the development of syntropy are called “syntropic genes,” whereas the genes that co-participate in pathophysiological mechanisms and prevent the co-occurrence of particular phenotypes are called “dystropic genes.” Prospects for studying the genetic basis of this phenomenon are highlighted. The publicly available database Hu-EN et can be used in order to identify syntropic genes, as will be shown as examples in an analysis of cardiovascular diseases.",

Bioorganic chemistry has contributed some achievements in solving the problems of the chemical structure, biological function, and physiological activity of biopolymers and low-molecular-weight bioregulators, as well as in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of different life processes. The most striking achievements in bioorganic chemistry are discussed in this paper.

All cloned promoters were shown to be substantially more active in cancer cells than in fibroblasts, while the PLK1 promoter was the most cancer-specific and promising one. The specificity of the promoters to cancer cells descended in the series PLK1, CKS1B, POLD1, MCM2, and CDC6. The bidirectional activity of the cloned CKS1B promoter was demonstrated. It apparently directs the expression of the SHC1 gene, which is located in a \"head-to-head\" position to the CKS1B gene in the human genome.

We used the classical fear conditioning model to show that ex vivo microscopy of the eGFP protein in Fos-Cre-eGFP mice enables mapping of the neurons of the various brain regions that undergo Cre-recombination during acquisition of a new experience. We exposed the animals to the new environment in brief sessions and demonstrated that double immunohistochemical staining enables a characterization of the types of neocortical and hippocampal neurons that undergo experience-dependent Cre-recombination. Notably, Fos-Cre-eGFP labeled cells appeared to belong to excitatory pyramidal neurons rather than to various types of inhibitory neurons. We also showed that a combination of genetic Cre-eGFP labeling with immunohistochemical staining of the endogenous c-Fos protein allows one to identify and compare the neuronal populations that are activated during two different episodes of new experiences in the same animal. This new approach can be used in a wide spectrum of tasks that require imaging and a comparative analysis of cognitive neuronal networks.",

It was shown in the experiments with the frog neuromuscular synapse using specific calcium-sensitive dye Oregon Green Bapta 1 that exogenous ATP reduces the amplitude of calcium transient, which reflects the changes in the entry of calcium ions in response to the nerve pulse. The depressing effect of ATP on the transient was prevented by suramin, the blocker of P2 receptors. Nitrendipine, a specific blocker of L-type calcium channels, per se decreased the calcium transient amplitude and significantly attenuated the effect of ATP on the calcium signal. Contrariwise, the preliminary application of ATP to the neuromuscular junction completely eliminated the depressing effect of nitrendipine on the calcium response. The obtained data suggest that an essential component in the inhibitory action of ATP on the calcium transient amplitude is provided by reduction of the entry of calcium ions into a frog nerve ending via L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.",

    "abstract": "One important distinction between many tumor cell types and normal cells consists in the translocation of a number of intracellular proteins, in particular the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), to the surface of the plasma membrane. It has been demonstrated that such surface localization of HSP70 on tumor cells is recognized by cytotoxic effectors of the immune system, which increases their cytolytic activity. The mechanisms behind this interaction are not fully clear; however, the phenomenon of surface localization of HSP70 on cancer cells can be used to develop new approaches to antitumor immunotherapy. At the same time, it is known that the presence of HSP70 on a cells surface is not a universal feature of cancer cells. Many types of tumor tissues do not express membrane-associated HSP70, which limits the clinical potential of these approaches. In this context, targeted delivery of exogenous HSP70 to the surface of cancer cells with the aim of attracting and activating the cytotoxic effectors of the immune system can be considered a promising means of antitumor immunotherapy. Molecular constructs containing recombinant mini-antibodies specific to tumor-associated antigens (in particular, antibodies specific to HER2/neu-antigen and other markers highly expressed on the surface of a wide range of cancer cells) can be used to target the delivery of HSP70 to tumor tissues. In order to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, recombinant constructs containing a mini-antibody specific to the HER2/ neu-antigen in the first module and HSP70 molecule or a fragment of this protein in the second module were developed in this study. Strong selective interaction between the modules was ensured by a cohesive unit formed by the barnase:barstar pair, a heterodimer characterized by an unusually high constant of association. During testing of the developed constructs in in vitro models the constructs exhibited targeted binding to tumor cells expressing the HER2/neu antigen and the agents had a significant stimulating effect on the cytotoxic activity of NK cells against the respective cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Linker histone H1 is one of the main chromatin proteins which plays an important role in organizing eukaryotic DNA into a compact structure. There is data indicating that cell type-specific post-translational modifications of H1 modulate chromatin activity. Here, we compared histone H1 variants from NIH/3T3, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FT-ICR-MS). We found significant differences in the nature and positions of the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of H1.3-H1.5 variants in ES cells compared to differentiated cells. For instance, methylation of K75 in the H1.2-1.4 variants; methylation of K108, K148, K151, K152 K154, K155, K160, K161, K179, and K185 in H1.1, as well as of K168 in H1.2; phosphorylation of S129, T146, T149, S159, S163, and S180 in H1.1, T180 in H1.2, and T155 in H1.3 were identified exclusively in ES cells. The H1.0 and H1.2 variants in ES cells were characterized by an enhanced acetylation and overall reduced expression levels. Most of the acetylation sites of the H1.0 and H1.2 variants from ES cells were located within their C-terminal tails known to be involved in the stabilization of the condensed chromatin. These data may be used for further studies aimed at analyzing the functional role played by the revealed histone H1 PTMs in the self-renewal and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Septins are GTP-binding proteins recognized as a component of the cytoskeleton. Despite the fact that septins are highly expressed by neurons and can interact with the proteins that participate in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis, the role of septins in synaptic transmission and the synaptic vesicle recycling mechanisms is poorly understood. In this study, neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis were investigated by microelectrode intracellular recording of end-plate potentials and fluorescent confocal microscopy in mouse diaphragm motor nerve endings during septin polymerization induced by forchlorfenuron application. It was shown that forchlorfenuron application reduces neurotransmission during prolonged high-frequency (20 and 50 pulses/s) stimulation. Application of pairs of short high-frequency stimulation trains showed that forchlorfenuron slows the replenishment of the readily releasable pool. Forchlorfenuron enhanced FM 1-43 fluorescent dye loading by synaptic vesicle endocytosis but decreased dye unloading from the preliminarily stained nerve endings by synaptic vesicle exocytosis. It was concluded that the septin polymerization induced by forchlorfenuron application slows the rate of synaptic vesicle recycling in motor nerve endings due to the impairment of synaptic vesicle transport.",

    "abstract": "The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an acute inflammatory disease of the respiratory system caused by the MERS-CoV coronavirus. The mortality rate for MERS is about 34.5%. Due to its high mortality rate, the lack of therapeutic and prophylactic agents, and the continuing threat of the spread of MERS beyond its current confines, developing a vaccine is a pressing task, because vaccination would help limit the spread of MERS and reduce its death toll. We have developed a combined vector vaccine for the prevention of MERS based on recombinant human adenovirus serotypes 26 and 5. Studies of its immunogenicity have shown that vaccination of animals (mice and primates) induces a robust humoral immune response that lasts for at least six months. Studies of the cellular immune response in mice after vaccination showed the emergence of a specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response. A study of the vaccine protectivity conducted in a model of transgenic mice carrying the human DPP4 receptor gene showed that our vaccination protected 100% of the animals from the lethal infection caused by the MERS-CoV virus (MERS-CoV EMC/2012, 100LD50 per mouse). Studies of the safety and tolerability of the developed vaccine in rodents, rabbits, and primates showed a good safety profile and tolerance in animals; they revealed no contraindications for clinical testing.",

    "abstract": "Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors have brought significant success in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, the search for novel molecular targets for the treatmentof this disease remains relevant. Earlier, expression of acid-sensing ion channels, ASIC1a, was demonstrated in the chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Three-finger toxins from the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) venom, mambalgins,have been shown to efficiently inhibit homo- and heteromeric channels containing the ASIC1a subunit; however, their use as possible antitumor agents had not been examined. In this work, using the patch-clamp technique, we detected,for the first time, an activation of ASIC1a channels in the leukemia K562 cells in response to an extracellular pH decrease. Recombinant mambalgin-2 was shown to inhibit ASIC1a activity and suppress the proliferation of the K562 cells with a half-maximaleffective concentration (EC50) ~ 0.2 M. Maximum mambalgin-2 inhibitory effect is achieved after 72 h of incubation with cells and when the pH of the cell medium reaches ~ 6.6. Inthe K562 cells, mambalgin-2 caused arrest of the cell cycle in the G1 phase and reduced the phosphorylation of G1 cell cycle phase regulators: cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4, without affecting the activity of CDK6 kinase. Thus, recombinant mambalgin-2 can be considered a prototype of a new type of drugs for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Transcription regulation in bacterial restrictionmodification (RM) systems is an important process, which provides coordinated expression levels of tandem enzymes, DNA methyltransferase (MTase) and restriction endonuclease (RE) protecting cells against penetration of alien DNA. The present study focuses on (cytosine-5)-DNA methyltransferase Ecl18kI (M.Ecl18kI), which is almost identical to DNA methyltransferase SsoII (M.SsoII) in terms of its structure and properties. Each of these enzymes inhibits expression of the intrinsic gene and activates expression of the corresponding RE gene via binding to the regulatory site in the promoter region of these genes. In the present work, complex formation of M.Ecl18kI and RNA polymerase from Escherichia сoli with the promoter regions of the MTase and RE genes is studied. The mechanism of regulation of gene expression in the Ecl18kI RM system is thoroughly investigated. M.Ecl18kI and RNA polymerase are shown to compete for binding to the promoter region. However, no direct contacts between M.Ecl18kI and RNA polymerase are detected. The properties of M.Ecl18kI and M.SsoII mutants are studied. Amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region of M.Ecl18kI, which performs the regulatory function, are shown to influence not only M.Ecl18kI capability to interact with the regulatory site and to act as a transcription factor, but also its ability to bind and methylate the substrate DNA. The loss of methylation activity does not prevent MTase from performing its regulatory function and even increases its affinity to the regulatory site. However, the presence of the domain responsible for methylation in the M.Ecl18kI molecule is necessary for M.Ecl18kI to perform its regulatory function.",

It is widely accepted that B lymphocyte activation is required for MS progression. Despite the fact that the exact triggering mechanisms of MS remain enigmatic, one may suggest that MS can be induced by viral or bacterial infection in combination with specific genetic and environmental factors. Using deep sequencing and functional selection methodologies we characterized clones of poly- and cross-reactive antibodies that are capable of simultaneous recognition of viral proteins and autoantigens. The latter, in turn, possibly may trigger MS progression through molecular mimicry. It was identified that two cross-reactive antigens are probably recognized by light or heavy chains individually. According to the high structural homology between selected autoantibodies and a number of various antiviral IgGs, we suggest that a wide range of pathogens, instead of a single virus, be regarded as possible triggers of MS.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation is a complex process that involves chemical modifications of the bases or sugar residues of specific nucleotides. One of the most abundant types of rRNA modifications, ribose 2-O-methylation, is guided by ribonucleoprotein complexes containing small nucleolar box C/D RNAs. Since the majority of 2-O-methylated nucleotides are located in the most conserved regions of rRNA that comprise functionally important centers of the ribosome, an alteration in a 2-O-methylation profile can affect ribosome assembly and function. One of the key approaches for localization of 2-O-methylated nucleotides in long RNAs is a method based on the termination of reverse transcription. The current study presents an adaptation of this method for the use of fluorescently labeled primers and analysis of termination products by capillary gel electrophoresis on an automated genetic analyzer. The developed approach allowed us to analyze the influence of the synthetic analogues of box C/D RNAs on post-transcriptional modifications of human 28S rRNA in MCF-7 cells. It has been established that the transfection of MCF-7 cells with a box C/D RNA analogue leads to an enhanced modification level of certain native sites of 2-O-methylation in the target rRNA. The observed effect of synthetic RNAs on the 2-O-methylation of rRNA in human cells demonstrates a path towards targeted regulation of rRNA post-transcriptional maturation. The described approach can be applied in the development of novel diagnostic methods for detecting diseases in humans.",

The thermal stability of the new mutant SoyFDHs was shown to be much higher than that of their precursors.

In this study, we analyzed the influence of transcriptional read-through on PRE activity switch mediated by the yeast activator GAL4. We show that a transcription terminator inserted between the promoter and PRE doesn't prevent switching of PRE activity from repression to activation. We demonstrate that, independently of PRE orientation, high levels of transcription fail to dislodge PcG/TrxG proteins from PRE in the absence of a terminator.

    "abstract": "Small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK channels) are widely expressed in CNS tissues. Their functions, however, have not been well studied. Participation of SK channels in Purkinje cell (PC) pacemaker activity has been studied predominantly in vitro. Here we studied for the first time the effects of SK channel activation by NS309 or CyPPA on the PC simple spike frequency in vivo in adult (3 - 6 months) and aged (22 - 28 months) rats using extracellular microelectrode recordings. Both pharmacological agents caused a statistically significant decrease in the PC simple spike frequency. The maximum value of the decrease in the simple spike frequency did not depend on age, whereas a statistically significant inhibition of the spike frequency was achieved faster in aged animals than in adult ones. In experiments on cultured neurons PCs were identified by the expression of calbindin as the PC-specific marker. Registration of transmembrane currents in cerebellar neurons revealed the direct action of NS309 and CyPPA on the SK channels of PC consisted in the enhancement of outward potassium currents and action potential after-hyperpolarization. Thus, SK channel activators can compensate for age-related changes of the autorhythmic functions of the cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "The peripheral blood monocytes of atherosclerotic patients are pre-activated and have some of the features of tissue macrophages. Their adhesion to the endothelium is 1.5 times higher than that of monocytes from healthy subjects, and they express a number of receptors and antigens typical of tissue macrophages. Additionally, earlier we showed that the biosynthesis of gangliosides, whose main function is the formation of membrane rafts, is significantly activated in blood monocytes from atherosclerotic patients, as well as during the in vitro differentiation of normal monocytes into macrophages. In this study, we investigated the expression of membrane rafts on various monocyte subsets from healthy subjects and atherosclerotic patients. Based on flow cytometry results, the monocytes in the examined atherosclerotic patients were found to differ from those in healthy subjects by a twofold increase in the proportion of the intermediate subset (CD14(++)/CD16(+)) and by enhancement in the expression of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 on the intermediate and non-classical subsets (CD14(++)/CD16(+) and CD14(+)/CD16(++)) (2.3 and 1.8 times, respectively). This suggests a pre-activated state of monocytes in atherosclerotic patients. At the same time, the expression of the membrane raft marker on the monocyte subsets was similar in both studied groups. However, a study of the in vitro differentiation of monocytes into macrophages showed that the membrane raft expression increased 2 times as early as on the 1st day of culturing and 3 times on the 7th day compared to that in freshly isolated monocytes. Therefore, it is suggested that monocytes in atherosclerosis accumulate gangliosides that are used to form membrane rafts during the macrophage differentiation after the migration of monocytes into the arterial intima.",

But the greatest interest for practical application is the return (reprogramming) of adult cells into the pluripotent state. In our study for the first time induced pluripotent cells were derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells by genetic reprogramming. We showed that these cells are similar to embryonic stem cells in their morphology, function, and molecular level. We are the first to show that reprogramming sufficiently changes X-chromosome chromatin state, which is normally inactive in female endothelial cells, towards its activation, providing evidence that endothelial cells are reprogrammed at an epigenetic level.",

A water solution of silver nanoparticles (SNP) with particle sizes of 9±6 nm was obtained by means of the original method of biochemical synthesis. The effect of the SNP solution was compared to those of AOT (anionic surfactant used as SNP stabilizer) and silver nitrate (i.e. Ag- ions) introduced as water solutions. In studies of the toxic effects, the death of mice was registered 12-24 hours after injection only at two maximum dozes of SNP (equivalent to 0.54 and 0.36 gAg/l). It is shown that the toxic effect decreases in the sequence SNP>AOT>>AgNO3. The LE50/30 values for SNP and AOT are equal to 0.30±0.07 gAg/l and 13.3±2.1 gAg/l, respectively. Genotoxic effects were assessed by the abnormal sperm heads test and neutral Comet assay. The frequencies of abnormal sperm heads (ASHs) did not differ after treatment by SNP and AOT, but both were significantly higher than those found with AgNO3 and in control mice. Comet assay showed an increase of the DNA percentage in the comet tail in spleen cells after the injection of SNP and AOT in concentrations of ½ LE50/30. Tail DNA % was 32.8±1.3 and 26.3±1.7%, respectively, vs 16.2±0.7% for the untreated control. To sum up, these tests showed that the genotoxic effects of the SNP solution are associated with the presence of AOT rather than SNP.",

Basic achievements in genome research have resulted in the deciphering of the human genome and creation of a molecular landmarks map of the human haploid genome (HapMap Project), which has made a tremendous contribution to our understanding of common genetic and multifactorial (complex) disorders. Current genome studies mainly focus on genetic testing and gene association studies of multifactorial (complex) diseases, with the purpose of their efficient diagnostics and prevention . Identification of candidate (\"predisposition\") genes participating in the functional genetic modules underlying each common disorder and the use of this genetic background to elaborate sophisticated measures to efficiently prevent them constitutes a major goal in personalized molecular medicine. The concept of a genetic pass as an individual DNA databank reflecting inherited human predisposition to different complex and monogenic disorders, with special emphasis on its present state, and the numerous difficulties related to the practical implementation of personalized medicine are outlined. The problems related to the uncertainness of the results of genetic testing could be overcome at least partly by means of new technological achievements in genome research methods, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), massive parallel DNA sequencing, and genetic and epigenetic profiling. The basic tasks of genomic today could be determined as the need to properly estimate the clinical value of genetic testing and its applicability in clinical practice. Feasible ways towards the gradual implementation of personal genetic data, in line with routine laboratory tests, for the benefit of clinical practice are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic messenger RNAs are capped, spliced, and polyadenylated via co-transcriptional processes that are coupled to each other and to the transcription machinery. Coordination of these processes ensures correct RNA maturation and provides for the diversity of the transcribed isoforms. Thus, RNA processing is a chain of events in which the completion of one event is coupled to the initiation of the next one. In this context, the relationship between splicing and polyadenylation is an important aspect of gene regulation. We have found that cryptic polyadenylation signals are widely distributed over the intron sequences of Drosophila melanogaster. As shown by analyzing the distribution of genes arranged in a nested pattern, where one gene is fully located within an intron of another gene, overlapping of putative polyadenylation signals is a fairly common event affecting about 17% of all genes. Here we show that polyadenylation signals are silenced within introns: the poly(A) signal is utilized in the exonic but not in the intronic regions of the transcript. The transcription does not end within the introns, either in a transient reporter system or in the genomic context, while deletion of the 5'-splice site restores their functionality. According to a full Drosophila transcriptome analysis, utilization of intronic polyadenylation signals occurs very rarely and such events are likely to be inducible. These results confirm that the transcription apparatus ignores premature polyadenylation signals for as long as they are intronic.",

However, numerous enzymes that derive from a common ancestor and have undergone substantial functional alterations during natural selection appear not to have a sequence similarity acceptable for a statistically reliable comparative analysis. At the same time, their active site structures, in general, can be conserved, while other parts may largely differ. Therefore, it sounds both plausible and appealing to implement a comparative analysis of the most functionally important structural elements - the active site structures; that is, the amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. A computer algorithm has been developed to create a library of enzyme active site structures based on the use of the PDB database, together with programs of structural analysis and identification of functionally important amino acid residues and cavities in the enzyme structure. The proposed methodology has been used to compare some α,β-hydrolase superfamily enzymes. The insight has revealed a high structural similarity of catalytic site areas, including the conservative organization of a catalytic triad and oxyanion hole residues, despite the wide functional diversity among the remote homologues compared. The methodology can be used to compare the structural organization of the catalytic and substrate binding sites of various classes of enzymes, as well as study enzymes' evolution and to create of a databank of enzyme active site structures.",

Phosphorylation of aminoglycoside phosphotransferase VIII (APHVIII) by protein kinases enhances resistance of the bacterial cell to aminoglycoside antibiotics, e.g. kanamycin. Addition of protein kinase inhibitors prevents phosphorylation and increases cell sensitivity to kanamycin. We have obtained modifications of APHVIII in which phosphorylatable Ser146 was encompassed into the canonical autophosphorylation sequence ofStreptomyces coelicolorPk25 protein kinase. Mutant and wild-typeaphVIII were cloned intoE. coliwith the catalytic domain ofpk25. As a result of the expression of these genes, accumulation of corresponding proteins was clearly observed. Extracted from bacterial lysates, Pk25 demonstrated its ability to autophosphorylate. It was shown that variants ofE. colicontaining bothaphVIIIand рк25were more resistant to kanamycin than those carrying onlyaphVIII. Protein kinase inhibitors of the indolylmaleimide class actively inhibited Pk25 and reduced cell resistance to kanamycin. Modeling of APHVIII and Pk25 3D structures showed that pSer146 is an analog of phosphoserine in the ribose pocket of protein kinase A. Pk25 conformation was similar to that of РknB ofMycobacterium tuberculosis. Potential indolylmaleimide inhibitors were docked into the ATP-binding pocket of Pk25.

We showed that technical manipulations in vitro, such as cell sorting and selection of clones, did not lead to the bottleneck effect, and that isogenic iPSCs derived from different types of somatic cells did not differ in their ability to differentiate into the hematopoietic and neural directions.

The TRPV1-mediated currents induced by the pH and Capsaicin demonstrated arithmetical summation at potentials between 40--40 mV, while they were potentiated at potentials below -40 mV. Currents induced by the pH and Capsaicin combined were higher in comparison with the arithmetic sum of the currents induced by the pH and Capsaicin applied separately at such potentials.

    "abstract": "We studied the intranuclear localization of protein nucleophosmin (B23) and ubiquitin in the dopaminergic neurons of human substantia nigra (n = 6, age of 25-87 years) using immunohistochemistry and confocal laser microscopy. Intranuclear ubiquitin-immunopositive bodies that morphologically correspond to Marinesco bodies were found to be present in substantia nigra dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-immunopositive) neurons but absent in non-dopaminergic neurons. The number of bodies varied from 0 to 6 per cell nucleus. Nucleophosmin (B23) was found in the neuronal nucleolus, with the nucleolus size being constant in the nigral neurons of each individual brain. All the observed neurons had only one large nucleolus with intense nucleophosmin immunoreactivity and a lightly stained region (1-2 m in diameter) that apparently represents the giant fibrillar center (GFC). An intensely immunostained nucleophosmin-containing granule was often observed at the GFC periphery. Double labeling demonstrated that nucleophosmin-immunoreactive nucleolus and ubiquitin-immunoreactive Marinesco bodies can occur both closely to and remotely from each other. Three-dimensional reconstruction indicates that rounded Marinesco bodies are polymorphic and often have a complex shape, with some flattening and concavities, which may be associated with contact not only with the nucleolus, but also, presumably, with other intranuclear structures free of ubiquitin or nucleophosmin. Ubiquitin-immunoreactive structures with a relatively small size (up to 1 m in length) and various clastosome-like shapes (Lafarga et al., 2002) often occur near Marinesco bodies. There were no cases of detection of ubiquitin in the nucleoli of dopaminergic neurons and nucleophosmin/B23 in typical Marinesco bodies. The obtained information may be helpful in unraveling the molecular mechanisms of the selective vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to damaging factors.",

Artificial substrates can modulate the phenotype and functional activity of immobilized cells. Investigating these changes is important for understanding the fundamental processes underlying cellular interactions in a 3D microenvironment and for improving tissue-engineered structures. In this study, we investigated the expression of the ICAM-1 adhesion molecule in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) when cultured on gelatin-fibroin scaffolds. Increased expression of ICAM-1 in MEF was detected only under 3D culture conditions both at the mRNA and protein levels. At the same time, the MEF cultured on various substrates did not oerexpress MAdCAM-1, indicating the selective effect of 3D culture conditions on ICAM-1 expression. One possible mechanism for ICAM-1 induction in MEF is associated with the activation of AP-1, since expression of c-Fos and Junb (but not cJun and Jund) was increased in MEF in 3D. When cultured under 2D conditions, the expression level of AP-1 components did not change.",

    "abstract": "Multiple forms of proteasomes regulate cellular processes by destroying proteins or forming the peptides involved in those processes. Various pathologies, including carcinogenesis, are related to changes in the functioning of the proteasome forms. In this study, we looked at the changes in the pool of liver proteasomes during nodular regenerative hyperplasia and formation of adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice treated with Dipin, followed by partial liver resection. The relative content of various proteasome forms was determined using Western blot analysis. The chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasomes was assessed from the hydrolysis of the commercial Suc-LLVY-AMC substrate. It was found that changes in the proteasome pool appeared already during the formation of diffuse nodules, the changes being the increased expression of the X(β5) constitutive subunit and the LMP7(β5i) and LMP2(β1i) immune subunits, accompanied by the increase of the total proteasome pool and the decrease in the chymotrypsin-like activity. These changes were more pronounced in hepatocellular carcinoma. The content of the total proteasome pool and the LMP2(β1i) immune subunit and the chymotrypsin-like activity in adenoma were intermediate compared to those in the samples of liver with diffuse nodules and carcinoma. In addition, the level of the Rpt6 subunit present in the 19S proteasome activator was increased in carcinoma. Our results indicate that nodular regenerative hyperplasia and adenomatosis may be stages preceding carcinogenesis. We also conclude that there is a need to find signalling pathways that change the expression of various proteasome subunits during carcinogenesis. The 19S proteasome activator, which is overexpressed in malignant tumours, can be a promising target for the development of new anticancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "Integration of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) DNA into the genome of an infected cell is one of the key steps in the viral replication cycle. The viral enzyme integrase (IN), which catalyzes the integration, is an attractive target for the development of new antiviral drugs. However, the HIV-1 therapy often results in the IN gene mutations inducing viral resistance to integration inhibitors. To assess the impact of drug resistance mutations on the activity of IN of HIV-1 subtype A strain FSU-A, which is dominant in Russia, variants of the consensus IN of this subtype containing the primary resistance mutations G118R and Q148K and secondary compensatory substitutions E138K and G140S were prepared and characterized. Comparative study of these enzymes with the corresponding mutants of IN of HIV-1 subtype B strains HXB-2 was performed. The mutation Q148K almost equally reduced the activity of integrases of both subtypes. Its negative effect was partially compensated by the secondary mutations E138K and G140S. Primary substitution G118R had different influence on the activity of proteins of the subtypes A and B, and the compensatory effect of the secondary substitution E138K also depended on the viral subtype. Comparison of the mutants resistance to the known strand transfer inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir, and a new inhibitor XZ-259 (a dihydro-1H-isoindol derivative), showed that integrases of both subtypes with the Q148K mutation were insensitive to raltegravir and elvitegravir but were effectively inhibited by XZ-259. The substitution G118R slightly reduced the efficiency of IN inhibition by raltegravir and elvitegravir and caused no resistance to XZ_259.",

Bacteriopurpurinimide derivatives are promising PSs thanks to their ability to absorb light in the near infrared spectral region. Using spectrophotometry, we show that two new bacteriopurpurinimide derivatives with different substituents at the N atoms of the imide exocycle and the pyrrole ring A are capable of forming non-covalent complexes with human serum albumin (HSA). The association constant (calculated with the Benesi-Hildebrand equation) for N-ethoxybacteriopurpurinimide ethyloxime (compound 1) is higher than that for the methyl ether of methoxybacteriopurpurinimide (compound 2) (1.1810 5 M-1 vs. 1.2610 4 M -1, respectively). Molecular modeling provides details of the atomic interactions between 1 and 2 and amino acid residues in the FA1 binding site of HSA. The ethoxy group stabilizes the position of 1 within this site due to hydrophobic interaction with the protein. The higher affinity of 1 for HSA makes this compound more potent than 2 in photodynamic therapy for cultured human colon carcinoma cells. Photoactivation of 1 and 2 in cells induces rapid (within a few minutes of irradiation) necrosis. This mechanism of cell death may be efficient for eliminating tumors resistant to other therapies.",

Nonetheless, the role of MUC1 in cancer metastasizing remains far from clear. The major hurdle remains the absence of adequate cell models. The aim of the present study was to create cell models that present different fragments of the human mucin MUC1 extracellular domain on their surface. Genetic constructions were generated on the basis of the plasmid vector pEGFP-N3. These constructions contain fusion genes coding for chimeric proteins composed of different combinations of mucin MUC1 functional domains and identification markers (FLAG-epitope, located at the N-terminus, and EGFP, located at the C-terminus of the chimeric proteins). These constructions were used for a stable transformation of HT-29 human cancer cells. The transformants obtained were characterized by flow cytometry. The low expression level of endogenous mucin MUC1 and the high expression level of recombinant proteins were confirmed by real-time PCR. The microscopic examination of the transformed cells confirmed the membrane localization of the fusion proteins. The resulting cell models could be used to investigate the role of the mucin MUC1 domains in cancer cell metastasizing. The obtained cells are used as an applicable model of MUC1-expressing cancers and might be used to study the role of different functional fragments of mucin MUC1 in metastasizing.",

This retrospective study is focused on the topographic features and time parameters of the cleavages, with particular emphasis on the lengths of cleavage cycles and the genealogy of blastomeres in 2- to 8-cell human embryos. We have found that all 4-cell human embryos have four developmental variants that are based on the sequence of appearance and orientation of cleavage planes during embryo cleavage from 2 to 4 blastomeres. Each variant of cleavage shows a strong correlation with further developmental dynamics of the embryos (different cleavage cycle characteristics as well as lengths of blastomere cycles). An analysis of the sequence of human blastomere divisions allowed us to postulate that the effects of zygotic determinants are eliminated as a result of cleavage, and that, thereafter, blastomeres acquire the ability of own syntheses, regulation, polarization, formation of functional contacts, and, finally, of specific differentiation. This data on the early development of human embryos obtained using noninvasive methods complements and extend our understanding of the embryogenesis of eutherian mammals and may be applied in the practice of reproductive technologies.",

Among these diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which causes the progressive degeneration and death of central and peripheral motor neurons, and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is one of the inherited diseases that prevail among hereditary diseases in the pattern of child mortality, hold a special place. These diseases, like most nerve, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric diseases, cannot be treated appropriately at present. Artificial model systems, especially those that are based on the use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are of paramount importance in searching for adequate therapeutic agents, as well as for a deep understanding of the MND pathogenesis. This review is mainly focused on the recent advance in the development of and research into cell and animal models of ALS and SMA. The main issues concerning the use of cellular technologies in biomedical applications are also described.",

Different amino acid residues have been introduced at position βF71, and the mutants were studied with respect to their enantioselectivity and substrate specificity. Some mutants demonstrated remarkably improved catalytic activity. Moreover, mutation of βF71 residue allowed to enhance penicillin acylase enantioselectivity. The catalytic activity to the specific substrates was improved up to 36 times, most notably for K, R, and L mutants. Increased activity to a D-phenylglycine derivative - a valuable specificity improvement for biocatalytic synthesis of new penicillins and cephalosporins - was shown for βF71R and βF71L mutants. The synthetic capacity of penicillin acylase with 6-aminopenicillanic acid as an external nucleophile was especially sensitive to mutation of the β71 residue in contrast to the synthesis with 7-aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a systemic neurodegenerative condition caused by the death of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system of the brain. This disease is diagnosed after most neurons have already been lost, which explains the low efficiency of treatment. Hope for increasing treatment efficiency rests in the development of new strategies for early diagnosis of PD based on a search for peripheral markers that appear as early changes in non-motor functions. Since impairment of the visual function is one of the manifestations of PD, the purpose of our work was to identify biochemical and physiological changes in a mouse's eye and eyelid in models of preclinical (presymptomatic) and clinical (symptomatic) stages of PD. We found that the norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin levels in the mouse eye reduced not only in the model of the early clinical stage, but also in the model of preclinical stage, an indication that pathological changes in the monoaminergic systems of the brain had affected the eye even before the motor disorders emerged. Moreover, in both models of PD, mice had increased intraocular pressure, indicating the development of both metabolic and functional impairments, which can be used as diagnostic markers. Unlike in the eye, the serotonin level in the eyelid was increased in mice at both parkinsonism stages and in presymptomatic mice to a much higher extent than in symptomatic ones. Given that serotonin is involved in the regulation of lacrimal glands of the eyelid, an increase in its level in parkinsonian mice should alter the composition of tear fluid, which could serve as a diagnostic marker of early stage of PD. Thus, the changes in the metabolism of monoamines in the eye and eyelid observed in mice at the early stage of parkinsonism are accompanied by changes in the function of these structures and, therefore, can be used as diagnostic markers of the early stage of PD.",

    "abstract": "In response to the wide variety of external and internal signals, mammalian cells undergo apoptosis, programmed cell death. Dysregulation of apoptosis is involved in multiple human diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, and ischemic injuries. Two types of apoptosis have been described: the caspase-dependent one, leading to digestion of cellular proteins, and caspase-independent apoptosis, resulting in DNA fragmentation. The latter type of apoptosis is executed by AIF protein and is believed to have appeared first during evolution. The key step in the caspase-independent apoptosis program is the dissociation of AIF from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). However, the molecular mechanism of interaction between AIF and OMM remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that AIF can bind to OMM via mortalin protein. We confirmed interaction between AIF and mortalin both in vitro and in vivo and mapped the amino acid sequences that are important for the binding of these proteins. Next, we showed that apoptosis induction by chemotherapy leads to downregulation of AIF-mortalin interaction and dissociation of AIF from the OMM. Finally, a bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that a high level of mortalin expression correlates with a worse survival prognosis for glioma patients. Altogether, our data revealed that mortalin plays an important role in the regulation of the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway and allowed us to speculate that inhibition of AIF-mortalin interaction may induce a dissociation of AIF from the OMM and subsequent apoptosis of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in 2012 during the first Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. MERS-CoV causes an acute lower-respiratory infection in humans, with a fatality rate of ~35.5%. Currently, there are no registered vaccines or means of therapeutic protection against MERS in the world. The MERS-CoV S glycoprotein plays the most important role in the viral life cycle (virus internalization). The S protein is an immunodominant antigen and the main target for neutralizing antibodies. In the present study, the immunogenicities of five different forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein were compared: the full-length S glycoprotein, the full-length S glycoprotein with the transmembrane domain of the G glycoprotein of VSV (S-G), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein, the membrane-fused RBD (the RBD fused with the transmembrane domain of the VSV G glycoprotein (RBD-G)), and the RBD fused with Fc of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc). Recombinant vectors based on human adenoviruses type 5 (rAd5) were used as delivery vehicles. Vaccination with all of the developed rAd5 vectors elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response in mice. The most robust humoral immune response was induced after the animal had been vaccinated with the membrane-fused RBD (rAd5-RBD-G). Only immunization with membrane forms of the glycoprotein (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G) elicited neutralizing antibodies among all vaccinated animals. The most significant cellular immune response was induced after vaccination of the animals with the full-length S (rAd5-S). These investigations suggest that the full-length S and the membrane form of the RBD (RBD-G) are the most promising vaccine candidates among all the studied forms of S glycoprotein.",

In this paper, we report on the design of chimeric constructs with differing orders of linkage of four tandem copies of M2e and the conserved fragment of HA2 (76-130) from phylogenetic group II influenza A viruses to the C-terminus of flagellin. The 3D-structure of two chimeric proteins showed that interior location of the M2e tandem copies (Flg-4M2e-HA2) provides partial -helix formation nontypical of native M2e on the virion surface. The C-terminal position of the M2e tandem copies (Flg-HA2-4M2e) largely retained its native M2e conformation. These conformational differences in the structure of the two chimeric proteins were shown to affect their immunogenic properties. Different antibody levels induced by the chimeric proteins were detected. The protein Flg-HA2-4M2e was more immunogenic as compared to Flg-4M2e-HA2, with the former offering full protection to mice against a lethal challenge. We obtained evidence suggesting that the order of linkage of target antigens in a fusion protein may influence the 3D conformation of the chimeric construct, which leads to changes in immunogenicity and protective potency.",

Two point mutations causing an elevated production of EEVs compared with the parental LIVP strain were inserted into the sequence of the VACV A34R gene. The created mutant LIVP-A34R strain showed lower neurovirulence in an intracerebral injection test and elevated antibody production in the intradermal injection method.

Oral treatment with both compounds in both doses protected 60-100% of the animals, significantly increased the survival rate, and abolished weight loss. The treatments also inhibited virus titer in the lungs in comparison to the control group. This treatment was more effective compared to rimantadine at the same scheme and dosage. Moreover, the study of the sensitivity of the virus isolated from the lungs of the treated mice and grown in MDCK cells showed that no resistance had emerged during the 5 days of treatment with both compounds.",

Bioluminescence is based on the chemical reaction of oxidation of a low-molecular-weight substrate (luciferin) by atmospheric oxygen, which is catalyzed by an enzyme (luciferase). Relaxation of the luciferin oxidation product from its excited state is accompanied by a release of a quantum of light, which can be detected as an analytical signal.The ability to express luciferase genes in various heterological systems and high quantum yields of luminescence reactions have made these tools rather popular in biology and medicine. Amongseveral naturally available luciferases, a few have been found to be useful for practicalapplication. Luciferase size, the wavelength of its luminescence maximum, enzyme thermostability, optimal pH of the reaction, and the need for cofactors areparameters that may differ for luciferases from different groups of organisms, and this fact directly affects the choice of the application area for each enzyme. It is quite important to overview the whole range of currently available luciferases based ontheir biochemical properties before choosing one bioluminescent probe suitable for a specific application.",

Inour study, a relationship between longSNCA-Rep1 alleles and Parkinsons was confirmed in the Russian population. Long allelic variants ofSNCA-Rep1 were shown to be associated with the hypomethylation of the CpG-sites in intron 1 of theSNCAgene. Long variants ofSNCA-Rep1 are supposed to exert their effect through the hypomethylation of atranscriptionally significant region of this gene.

    "abstract": "CCR5del32 Homozygous deletion in the chemokine receptor R5 gene provides almost complete protection to individuals against HIV infection. However, data relating to the protective effect for CCR5del32 heterozygous individuals have been contradictory. The frequency of the CCR5del32 allele in population control cohorts was compared with that of a group of children (27 Kalmyks and 50 Russians) infected by G-subtype HIV-1 in a nosocomial outbreak. The frequency of the CCR5del32 allele was shown to be lower among the infected children in comparison with that of the control group; however, the difference was small and statistically insignificant. Similar results were obtained in a number of earlier studies. The insignificance of the small differences could be a result of one of two reasons. (i) The fact that there is no protective effect of the heterozygous state, and that the phenomenon depends only on the fluctuation of allele frequencies. In this case, there would be no differences even if the infected cohort is enlarged. (ii)The protective effect of the heterozygous state is real; however, the size of the studied cohort is insufficient to demonstrate it. In order to discern between these two reasons, a meta-analysis of data from 25 published articles (a total of 5,963 HIV-infected individuals and 5,048 individuals in the control group, including the authors own data) was undertaken. A conclusion was drawn from the meta-analysis that the CCR5del32 allele protects individuals against the HIV infection even in a heterozygous state (OR=1.22, 95%CI=1.10-1.36). The risk of HIV infection for CCR5 wt/del32 heterozygotes was lower by at least 13% as compared to that for wild type CCR5 wt/wt homozygotes. Prior to this study, no data of the type or any conclusions had been published for Caucasians. The mortality rate in the 15 years following the infection was found to be approximately 40% lower for CCR5del32 heterozygotes in comparison with that for the wild type homozygotes in the studied group. The size of the studied group was insufficient to claim difference validity (OR=2.0; p= 0.705), even though the effect quantitatively matched the published data. The features of the meta-analysis influencing the threshold level and the statistical validity of the effects are being discussed. The level of the CCR5del32 protective effect on the chances to be infected with HIV and on the outcome of the HIV infection was assessed for various ethnic groups.",

A three-dimensional model of mouse epidermis was generated from the epidermal keratinocytes of newborn mice and treated with cytokines. The aim of this study was to evaluate this model as an experimental model of psoriasis and to assess the changes occurring in its structure and gene expression after the exposure to proinflammatory cytokines. Treatment of the three-dimensional model with either interleukin 17 or a combination of tumor necrosis factor and interferon was shown to produce morphological changes, which were similar to acanthosis in psoriatic skin. The observed changes in gene expression of metalloproteinases and certain psoriasis biomarkers, such as mki67, krt16 and fosl1, were similar to the changes in patients skin. Notably, changes caused by interleukin 17 were less evident than those caused by the combination of interferon and tumor necrosis factor. On the contrary, HaCaT cells exhibited no significant changes in the expression of fosl1 and had decreased levels of mki67 after being treated with a combination of TNF and IFNG. Moreover, treatment with IL17 had no significant effect on krt16 and mki67 expression and even reduced the fosl1 levels. The findings suggest that artificially generated three-dimensional models of murine skin can be used to study psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "The high resolution crystal structure of bacterial ribosome was determined more than 10 years ago; however, it contains no information on the structure of the largest ribosomal protein, S1. This unusual protein comprises six flexibly linked domains; therefore, it lacks a fixed structure and this prevents the formation of crystals. Besides being a component of the ribosome, protein S1 also serves as one of the four subunits of Q replicase, the RNA-directed RNA polymerase of bacteriophage Q. In each case, the role of this RNA-binding protein has been thought to consist in holding the template close to the active site of the enzyme. In recent years, a breakthrough was made in studies of protein S1 within Q replicase. This includes the discovery of its paradoxical ability to displace RNA from the replicase complex and determining the crystal structure of its fragment capable of performing this function. The new findings call for a re-examination of the contribution of protein S1 to the structure and function of the ribosome.",

The presence of this structure is essential for the development of an acute infection; the chronicity of the infection is fundamentally dependent upon its functioning. In this regard, T3TS is one of the most promising targets for the development of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs that do not develop resistance and are efficacious for the acute and chronic forms of infection. The mechanism of action in drug development is based on the specific inhibition of T3SS, which should interrupt the infectious process, thereby enabling the immune system to eliminate the pathogen. As a result of pilot screening using specific cellular and bacterial tests, followed by chemical optimization and detailed characterization of the biological activity, a new class of chlamydial T3SS inhibitors was obtained. The selected compounds have obvious advantages over the currently available inhibitors of T3SS pathogens thanks to the high inhibitory activity of these compounds with minimal damaging effects on eukaryotic cells. Preclinical trials of the selected inhibitors are currently under way.",

One of the most promising directions in this field is the study of the transdifferentiation abilities of cells within the same germ layer. A method for anin vitroinvestigation of the cell differentiation potential (the cell culture in a three-dimensional matrix) is described in this article. Cell cultures of postnatal salivary gland cells and postnatal liver progenitor cells were obtained; their comparative analysis under 2D and 3D cultivation conditions was carried out. Both cell types have high proliferative abilities and can be cultivated for more than 20 passages. Under 2D cultivation conditions, the cells remain in an undifferentiated state. Under 3D conditions, they undergo differentiation, which was confirmed by a lower cell proliferation and by an increase in the differentiation marker expression. Salivary gland cells can undergo hepatic and pancreatic differentiation under 3D cultivation conditions. Liver progenitor cells also acquire a pancreatic differentiation capability under conditions of 3D cultivation. Thus, postnatal salivary gland cells exhibit a considerable differentiation potential within the endodermal germ layer and can be used as a promising source of endodermal cells for the cellular therapy of liver pathologies. Cultivation of cells under 3D conditions is a useful model for thein vitroanalysis of the cell differentiation potential.",

In the present work, we continue the study of the antiviral efficiency of Hp-ACG against HSV administered non-invasively; namely in vivo, orally and in the form of ointment formulations.

A comparative evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy parameters of polyethylene glycol-based ACV ointment and Hp-ACG ointment was carried out after a 5-day course in the model of an experimental cutaneous infection of HSV-1 in guinea pigs. It was found that Hp-ACG has a significant therapeutic effect resulting in a statistically significant reduction in the lesions surface area and the amount of vesicular structures.

As follows from the results of a RT -PCR analysis, the expression of the vimentin, somatostatin, GATA 4, and GATA 6 genes, being the markers of endodermal differentiation, does not vary in both the cells with high pub gene expression and the cells with low pub gene expression, as well as in the corresponding control lines. The cells with high pub gene expression are characterized by an increase in the expression of mesodermal differentiation gene-markers ( trI card, trI skel, c-kit, and IL-7), whereas the cells with low pub gene expression are specified by a decrease in their expression. According to the analyses carried out, the reverse is characteristic of the expression of ectodermal differentiation gene-markers ( nestin, β- III tubulin, gfap, and th). Expression of these genes decreases in cell lines with high pub gene expression, whereas their expression increases with the decrease in pub gene expression. Hence, it is suggested that the variations in the pub gene expression in the embryonic stem cells influence significantly the mesodermal and ectodermal differentiation of these cells.",

Short-term perfusion of the synaptic region with low concentrations of SNAP led to a decrease in the amplitude of the answers of mGluR agonists ACPD and DHPG. The inhibitory effect of the NO donor was eliminated under blockade of soluble guanylate cyclase with a specific inhibitor ODQ. A prolonged application of NO did not cause a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the ACPD response. However, SNAP at concentrations of 10 and 100 M increased the amplitude of the mGluR agonist responses 30 and 15 minutes, respectively, after termination of the NO donor exposure. The obtained data show the multidirectional effect of NO on the function of mGluR and testify to the existence of a complex modulating mechanism of the afferent flow from vestibular organs to the central nervous system.",

The genetically encoded phototoxins 4D5scFv-miniSOG and DARPin-miniSOG specifically bind to the HER2 receptor overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells and promote receptor-mediated internalization of HER2. We show that ingestion of proteins in a complex with the receptor reduces the fluorescent signal of the phototoxic module in endosomes. In order to clarify the mechanism of decrease in the fluorescence intensity of miniSOG-based proteins as they enter a cancer cell during internalization, we analyzed the influence of different factors, including low pH, proteolysis, cofactor reduction, and shielding, on changes in the fluorescence of photosensitizers. Shielding and absorption of miniSOG fluorescence by cell fluorophores, including cytochrome c, were found to contribute significantly to the changes in the fluorescent properties of miniSOG.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens challenges modern technologies of drug discovery. Combinatorial chemistry approaches are based on chemical libraries. They enable the creation of high-affinity low-molecular-weight ligands of the therapeutically significant molecular targets of human cells, thus opening an avenue toward a directed design of highly effective therapeutic agents. Nevertheless, these approaches face insurmountable difficulties in antibiotic discovery. Natural compounds that have evolved for such important characteristics as broad specificity and efficiency are a good alternative to chemical libraries. However, unrestricted use of natural antibiotics and their analogues leads to avalanche-like spread of resistance among bacteria. The search for new natural antibiotics, in its turn, is extremely complicated nowadays by the problem of antibiotic rediscovery. This calls for the application of alternative high-throughput platforms for antibiotic activity screening, cultivation of unculturable microorganisms, exploration of novel antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters, as well as their activation and heterologous expression. Microfluidic technologies for the screening of antibiotic activity at the level of single cells are, therefore, of great interest, since they enable the use of a single platform to combine the technology of ultrahigh-throughput screening, next-generation sequencing, and genome mining, thus opening up unique opportunities for antibiotic discovery.",

    "abstract": "Opisthorchis felineus, a hepatic trematode, is the causative agent of opisthorchiasis, a dangerous disease in both human beings and animals. Opisthorchiasis is widespread in Russia, especially Western Siberia. The purpose of the present study was to determine the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of this flatworm. Two parallel methods were employed: (1) capillary electrophoresis to sequence the mitochondrial genome fragments obtained through specific PCR amplification, and (2) high throughput sequencing of the DNA sample. Both methods made possible the determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of the O. felineus mitochondrial genome. The genome consists of a ring molecule 14,277 nt in length that contains 35 genes coding 2 rRN A, 22 tRN A, and 12 proteins: 3 subunits of cytochrome-C-oxidase, 7 subunits of NADH-dehydrogenase, B apocytochrome, and subunit 6 of ATP-synthetase. Like many other flatworms, O. felineus is characterized by the absence of the ATP-synthetase subunit 8 gene. Nineteen out of the 22 tRN As have a typical “clover leaf” structure. The tRN A(AGC) and tRN A-Cys genes lack DHU-loops, while the tRN A-Ser(UC A) has 2 alternative structures: one with a DHU-loop, and one without it. Analyzing the results obtained from the high throughput sequencing revealed 45 single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the mitochondrial genome. The results obtained in this study may be used in the development of molecular diagnostic methods for opisthorchiasis. This study shows that high throughput sequencing is a fast and effective method for decoding the mitochondrial genome of animals.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular protons play a special role in the regulation of presynaptic processes, since the functioning of synaptic vesicles and endosomes depends on their acidification by the H+-pump. Furthermore, transient acidification of the intraterminal space occurs during synaptic activity. Using microelectrode recording of postsynaptic responses (an indicator of neurotransmitter release) and exo-endocytic marker FM1-43, we studied the effects of intracellular acidification with propionate on the presynaptic events underlying neurotransmitter release. Cytoplasmic acidification led to a marked decrease in neurotransmitter release during the first minute of a 20-Hz stimulation in the neuromuscular junctions of mouse diaphragm and frog cutaneous pectoris muscle. This was accompanied by a reduction in the FM1-43 loss during synaptic vesicle exocytosis in response to the stimulation. Estimation of the endocytic uptake of FM1-43 showed no disruption in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Acidification completely prevented the action of the cell-membrane permeable compound 24-hydroxycholesterol, which can enhance synaptic vesicle mobilization. Thus, the obtained results suggest that an increase in [H+]in negatively regulates neurotransmission due to the suppression of synaptic vesicle delivery to the sites of exocytosis at high activity. This mechanism can be a part of the negative feedback loop in regulating neurotransmitter release.",

Nowadays, numerous protocols exist which provide a neural differentiation of the stem cells transplanted into the retina. However, questions concerning the functional replacement of the missing retinal neurons by transplanted cells thus far remain unanswered. The organotypic culture protocol was used in this study in order to prove the possibility of transdifferentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MMSCs) and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) from EGFP-positive mice and the functional integration of these cells. This technique enables a detailed characterization of cell behavior post-transplantation. Using atomic force microscopy, we reliably demonstrated the difference (p < 0.01) between the thickness of the outgrowths formed by glial and endothelial retina cells and the thickness of neurites and neuro-like transplanted MMSC outgrowths. MMSCs are also shown to form synapses up to 2.5 ± 0.06 µm in diameter on day 4 after the transplantation. Following electrical stimulation (20V, 0.5Hz, 200ms), clear depolarization of retinal neurons and their outgrowths is detected. It is shown that some of these GFP+ MMSCs, which changed their morphology after the transplantation in retinal explants to neuro-like MMSCs, are capable of depolarizing after exogenous stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Merocyanine 540 (MC540) is used as a photosensitizer for the inactivation of microorganisms. The following is already known about MC540: firstly, MC540 exists in distilled water in both monomeric and dimeric forms, and the addition of salts into a MC540 solution leads to the formation of large aggregates that can be detected by the resonance light scattering technique. Secondly, singlet oxygen can only be photogenerated by MC540 monomers. In the present work, we studied the effect of MC540 in the aggregated state on the rate of photosensitized inactivation ofStaphylococcus aureusandPseudomonas aeruginosa. To this end, bacteria either in MC540-containing distilled water or in a 0.25 M sodium chloride aqueous solution also containing MC540 are irradiated (546 nm). The results show that, in the presence of salt, the aggregation of MC540 greatly increases the efficiency of the MC540-photosensitized inactivation ofP. aeruginosaandS. aureus. In the presence of salt, the rates ofP. aeruginosaandS. aureusinactivation increase by factors of 10 and 30, respectively, in comparison with the rate of inactivation observed in the case of distilled water. Our results suggest that a salt-induced photosensitization mechanism can switch from the singlet oxygen to the free-radical pathway.",

Significant association with MI was observed in carriage frequencies of the allele TGFB1*-509T (p=0.046, OR =1.45, 95% CI: 1.02-2.06), genotypes TGFB1*869T/T (p=0.0024, OR =1.75, 95% CI: 1.22-2.51), and TGFB1*915G/G (p=0.048, OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.05-2.97). Linkage disequilibrium analysis for these SNPs has shown that the associations revealed can be considered to be independent. A complex analysis of MI association with combinations of alleles/genotypes of said SNPs indicates their cumulative effect. An analysis of susceptibility to early-onset MI ( 50 years old) revealed a positive association of the allele TGFB1*-509T (p=0.002, OR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.35-3.71) and genotype TGFB1*869T/T (p=0.008, OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.18-3.15), as well as their additivity. An analysis of susceptibility to recurrent MI revealed an association of the genotype TGFB1*-509T/T (p=0.0078, 0R=2.60, 95% CI: 1.28-5.28). The results obtained indicate the important role of the TGFB1 gene in susceptibility to MI, including early-onset and recurrent MI, in Russians.",

Abnormalities in the balance of signaling pathways can lead to the transformation of a normal cell, which results in tumor formation. Detection of the target genes and the proteins they encode and that are involved in the malignant transformation is one of the major evolutions in anti-cancer biomedicine.

Investigation of the dynamics of axonal terminal degeneration may help in the identification of new targets for neuroprotective treatment and be used as a tool for testing potential drugs. We have shown that the degeneration rate of dopaminergic axonal terminals changes over time, and that the striatal dopamine concentration is the most sensitive parameter to the action of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). This model was validated using neuroprotectors with well-known mechanisms of action: the dopamine transporter inhibitor nomifensine and SEMAX peptide that stimulates the secretion of endogenous neurotrophic factors or acts as an antioxidant. Nomifensine was shown to almost completely protect dopaminergic fibers from the toxic effect of MPTP and maintain the striatal dopamine concentration at the control level. However, SEMAX, slightly but reliably, increased striatal dopamine when administered before MPTP treatment, which indicates that it is more effective as an inductor of endogenous neurotrophic factor secretion rather than as an antioxidant.",

The optimal laboratory protocol, including crude bacteria lyses by a solution of 50% acetonitrile, 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and using α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid as the MALDI matrix, has been developed. Two different bacteria species were under investigation, and representative mass spectra from 278 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 22 strains of Helicobacter pylori have been analyzed. It’s known that both bacteria demonstrate a variable degree of polymorphism. For N. gonorrhoeae, the MALDI mass spectra that was collected possessed about 70 peaks, 20 of which were good reproducible ones. In spite of the fact that three peaks were found with differing spectra in some strains, little diversity in the N. gonorrhoeae population was revealed. This fact indicates the prospects in using direct MALDI mass-spectrometry profiling for gonococcus identification. In the case of H. pylori strains, the variety in the collected mass-spectra was shown to be essential. Only five peaks were present in more than 70% of strains, and a single mass value was common for all spectra. While these data call into question the possibility of the reliable species identification of H. pylori using this approach, the intraspecies differentiation of strains was offered. Good association between MALDI profile distributions and the region of strain isolation have been found. Thus, the suggested direct MALDI mass-spectrometry profiling strategy, coupled with special analysis software, seems promising for the species identification of N. gonorrhoeae but is assumed insufficient for H. pylori species determination. At the same time, this would create a very good chance for an epidemiological study of such variable bacteria as H. pylori.",

The data presented characterize the sensitivity of a series of DNA-dependent enzymes that are widely used in the detection of noncomplementary base pairs in nucleic acid substrate complexes. We have analyzed the spatial properties of the enzyme-substrate complexes. These properties are vital for the enzymatic reaction and the recognition of perfect DNA-substrates.

    "abstract": "We compared the thermal aggregation properties of two isoforms of the isolated myosin head (myosin subfragment 1, S1) containing different \"essential\" (or \"alkali\") light chains, A1 or A2. Temperature dependencies for the aggregation of these two S1 isoforms, as measured by the increase in turbidity, were compared with the temperature dependencies of their thermal denaturation obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. At relatively high ionic strength (in the presence of 100 mM KCl) close to its physiological values in muscle fibers, we have found no appreciable difference between the two S1 isoforms in their thermally induced aggregation. Under these conditions, the aggregation of both S1 isoforms was independent of the protein concentration and resulted from their irreversible denaturation, which led to the cohesion of denatured S1 molecules. In contrast, a significant difference between these S1 isoforms was revealed in their aggregation measured at low ionic strength. Under these conditions, the aggregation of S1 containing a light chain A1 (but not A2) was strongly dependent on protein concentration, the increase of which (from 0.125 to 2.0 mg/ml) shifted the aggregation curve by ~10 degrees towards the lower temperatures. It has been concluded that the aggregation properties of this S1 isoform at low ionic strength is basically determined by intermolecular interactions of the N-terminal extension of the A1 light chain (which is absent in the A2 light chain) with other S1 molecules. These interactions seem to be independent of the S1 thermal denaturation, and they may take place even at low temperature.",

Novel approaches to vaccination can help circumvent this problem. One of these new methods incorporates genetic vaccines based on adenoviral vectors. Recombinant adenoviral vectors which contain hemagglutinin-encoding genes from avian H5N1 and H5N2 (Ad-HA5-1 and Ad-HA5-2) influenza viruses were obtained using the AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene). Laboratory mice received a double intranasal vaccination with Ad-HA5-1 and Ad-HA5-2. This study demonstrates that immunization with recombinant adenoviruses bearing the Н5 influenza virus hemagglutinin gene induces a immune response which protect immunized mice from a lethal dose of the H5 influenza virus. Moreover, it also protects the host from a lethal dose of H1 virus, which belongs to the same clade as H5, but does not confer protection from the subtype H3 influenza virus, which belongs to a different clade. Our data allow us to conclude that adenoviral vectors may become a universal platform for obtaining vaccines against seasonal and pandemic strains of the influenza virus.",

DNA-dependent enzymes (DNA polymerases and DNA ligases) are widely used to enhance the sensitivity and reliability of systems intended for the detection of point mutations in genetic material. In this article, we have summarized the data on the selectiveness of DNA-dependent enzymes and on the structural factors in enzymes and DNA which influence the effectiveness of mismatch discrimination during enzymatic conversion of oligonucleotide probes on a DNA template. The data presented characterize the sensitivity of a series of DNA-dependent enzymes that are widely used in the detection of noncomplementary base pairs in nucleic acid substrate complexes. We have analyzed the spatial properties of the enzyme-substrate complexes. These properties are vital for the enzymatic reaction and the recognition of perfect DNA-substrates. We also discuss relevant approaches to increasing the selectivity of enzyme-dependent reactions. These approaches involve the use of modified oligonucleotide probes which \"disturb\" the native structure of the DNA-substrate complexes.",

Immunization with DNA constructs targeted to the endosomal-lysosomal compartments and to the MHC class II pathway can elicit a strong immune response. Herein, the weakly immunogenic reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 was fused to the minimal lysosomal targeting motif of the human MHC class II invariant chain. The motif fused to the N-terminus shifted the enzyme intracellular localization and accelerated its degradation. Degradation of the chimeric protein occurred predominantly in the lysosomal compartment. BALB/c mice immunized with the plasmid encoding the chimeric protein demonstrated an enhanced immune response, in the form of an increased antigen-specific production of Th1 cytokines, INF- and IL-2, by mouse splenocytes. Moreover, the majority of the splenocytes secreted both cytokines; i.e., were polyfunctional. These findings suggest that retargeting of the antigen to the lysosomes enhances the immune response to DNA vaccine candidates with low intrinsic immunogenicity.",

The DNA fragment, about 440 bp in length, was amplified by use of the genomic DNA of a wild E.coli LM N17 strain as a template and was inserted into the pMTL22 vector. Endonuclease activity was detected in an E.coli ER 2267 strain transformed with the obtained construction. A new enzyme named ElmI was purified by chromatographic techniques from the recombinant strain biomass. It was discovered that similarly to BisI this enzyme specifically cleaves the methylated DNA sequence 5-GCNGC- 3 before the central nucleotide N if this sequence contains two 5-methylcytosines. However, unlike BisI, ElmI more efficiently cleaves this sequence if more than two cytosine residues are methylated.",

    "abstract": "The abrupt cessation of effective cardiac function that is generally due to heart rhythm disorders can cause sudden and unexpected death at any age and is referred to as a syndrome called sudden cardiac death (SCD). Annually, about 400,000 cases of SCD occur in the United States alone. Less than 5% of the resuscitation techniques are effective. The prevalence of SCD in a population rises with age according to the prevalence of coronary artery disease, which is the most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest. However, there is a peak in SCD incidence for the age below 5 years, which is equal to 17 cases per 100,000 of the population. This peak is due to congenital monogenic arrhythmic canalopathies. Despite their relative rarity, these cases are obviously the most tragic. The immediate causes, or mechanisms, of SCD are comprehensive. Generally, it is arrhythmic death due to ventricular tachyarrythmias - sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Bradyarrhythmias and pulseless electrical activity account for no more than 40% of all registered cardiac arrests, and they are more often the outcome of the abovementioned arrhythmias. Our current understanding of the mechanisms responsible for SCD has emerged from decades of basic science investigation into the normal electrophysiology of the heart, the molecular physiology of cardiac ion channels, the fundamental cellular and tissue events associated with cardiac arrhythmias, and the molecular genetics of monogenic disorders of the heart rhythm (for example, the long QT syndrome). This review presents an overview of the molecular and genetic basis of SCD in the long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and sudden cardiac death prevention strategies by modern techniques (including implantable cardioverter-defibrillator).",

This report presents efficient protocols for assessment of the parameters of adaptive cell-mediated immunity in common marmosets, including the major subpopulations of lymphocytes and main markers of T- and B-cell maturation and activation using flow cytometry with a multicolor panel of fluorescently labelled antibodies. Blood samples from eight common marmosets were stained with fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies against their population markers (CD45, CD3, CD20, CD4, CD8) and lymphocyte maturation and activation markers (CD69, CD62L, CD45RO, CD107a and CD27) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Within the CD45+ population, 22.75.5% cells were CD3- CD20+ and 67.66.3% were CD3+CD20-. The CD3+ subpopulation included 55.75.5% CD3+CD4+CD8- and 34.33.7% CD3+CD4-CD8+ cells. Activation and maturation markers were expressed in the following lymphocyte proportions: CD62L on 54.010.7% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 74.412.1% of CD3+CD8+ cells; CD69 on 2.71.2% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 1.20.5% of CD3+CD8+ cells; CD45RO on 1.60.6% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 1.80.7% of CD3+CD8+ cells; CD107a on 0.70.5% of CD3+CD4+ cells and 0.50.3% of CD3+CD8+ cells; CD27 on 94.62.1% of CD3+ cells and 8.93.9% CD20+ cells.

The ability of the tested agents to form ion-conductive transmembrane pores, influence the electrical stability of lipid bilayers and the phase transition of membrane lipids, and cause the deformation and fusion of lipid vesicles was investigated. It was established that both compounds exert a strong detergent effect on model membranes. The results of differential scanning microcalorimetry and measuring of the threshold transmembrane voltage that caused membrane breakdown before and after adsorption of LCTA-1975 and LCTA-2701 indicated that both agents cause disordering of membrane lipids. Synergism of the uncoupling action of antibiotics and the alkaloid capsaicin on model lipid membranes was shown. The threshold concentration of the antibiotic that caused an increase in the ion permeability of the lipid bilayer depended on the membrane lipid composition. It was lower by an order of magnitude in the case of negatively charged lipid bilayers than for the uncharged membranes. This can be explained by the positive charge of the tested agents. At the same time, LCTA-2701 was characterized by greater efficiency than LCTA-1975. In addition to its detergent action, LCTA-2701 can induce ion-permeable transmembrane pores: step-like current fluctuations corresponding to the opening and closing of individual ion channels were observed. The difference in the mechanisms of action might be related to the structural features of the antibiotic molecules: in the LCTA-1975 molecule, all three substituents at the nitrogen atoms of the indole rings are identical and represent n-alkyl (pentyl) groups, while LCTA-2701 contains a maleimide group, along with two alkyl substituents (n-propyl). The obtained results might be relevant to our understanding of the mechanism of action of new antibacterial agents, explaining the difference in the selectivity of action of the tested agents on the target microorganisms and their toxicity to human cells. Model lipid membranes should be used in further studies of the trends in the modification and improvement of the structures of new antibacterial agents.",

An NG-24 generator (140 kg, 42 × 110 cm, ~1011 particles/s, > 14 MeV) has been designed and engineered to replace the huge and environmentally harmful neutron reactors, cyclotrons, and accelerators with a compact, portable, safe, and potent source of high-energy neutrons. We demonstrate that the neutron beam produced by NG-24 causes a significant antiproliferative effect on human tumor cell lines regardless of the status of the anti-apoptotic p53 protein. Phosphorylation of histone 2A and increased amounts of p21, cyclin D, and phospho-p53 were detectable in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (wild-type p53) irradiated with 4 Gy several days post-treatment, accompanied by G2/M phase arrest. These treatments dramatically reduced the ability of single cells to form colonies. In the HCT116p53KO subline (p53 -/-), the G2/M arrest was independent of the aforementioned mechanisms. Hence, the NG-24 generator is a source of a powerful, therapeutically relevant neutron flux that triggers a p53-independent antiproliferative response in tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "The nonapeptides of neurohypophysis, vasotocin and mesotocin, detected in most vertebrates, are replaced by vasopressin and oxytocin in mammals. Using bioinformatics methods, we determined the spectrum of receptor subtypes for these hormones in mammals and their physiological effects in the kidneys of rats. A search for sequences similar to the vertebrate vasotocin receptor by proteomes and transcriptomas of nine mammalian species and the rat genome revealed three subtypes of vasopressin receptors (V1a, V1b, and V2) and one type of oxytocin receptors. In the kidneys of non-anesthetized rats, which received a water load of 2 ml per 100 g of body weight, three effects of vasopressin were revealed: 1) increased reabsorption of water and sodium, 2) increased excretion of potassium ions, and 3) increased excretion of sodium ions. It has been suggested that each of the effects on the kidney is associated with selective stimulation of the vasopressin receptor subtypes V2, V1b, and V1a depending on the concentration of nonapeptide. In experiments on non-anaesthetized rats with a water load, the injection of oxytocin reduces the reabsorption of solute-free water in the kidneys and increases the excretion of sodium ions. The possible physiological mechanisms behind the realization of both effects with the participation of a single type of oxytocin receptors are being analyzed. Thus, the spectrum of activated receptor subtypes varies depending on the current concentration of neurohypophyseal hormones, as a result of which the predominant effect on renal function changes, which ensures precise regulation of water-salt homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol abuse is one of the main reasons behind the low life span in Russia. Both social and genetic factors affect the alcohol consumption level. The genetic factors are alleles of the alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1B and aldehyde dehydrogenaseALDH2 genes. We have typed and found frequencies for the alleles in a cohort of 642 men, ethnic Russians. The individuals of the cohort were asked to complete a questionnaire in the framework of the Izhevsk Family Study (Leon et al., 2007, 2009) regarding the amount of alcohol consumed and on the type of hazardous alcohol consumption (nonbeverage alcohol consumption and the so-called zapo which is a Russian term for a heavy drinking bout lasting for at least 2 days, when an individual is withdrawn from the normal social life). The ADH1B*48His allele was found among heterozygous individuals only (N=68, 10.6% of the cohort). The ALDH2*504Lys allele was also found among heterozygous individuals only (N=2, 0.3%) The effect of ADH1B alleles and the influence of the education level on the amount and type of alcohol consumed had not previously been studied in Russians. We have found that the amount of consumed alcohol is 21.6% lower (1733 g of ethanol per year) for ADH1B*48His allele carriers in the cohort of Russian men. The amount of consumed alcohol was found to be 9.8% lower (793 g of ethanol per year) in the case when individuals had a higher education as compared to those who had a secondary- or elementary school education level in the same cohort. Hence, the protective effect of the genetic factor (ADH1B*48His allele carriage) has proven to be more pronounced than the influence of the social factor (education level) at the individual level in the cohort of Russian men. Both factors have also proven to have a protective effect against hazardous types of alcohol consumption. Zapo was not scored among individuals of the cohort with ADH1B*48His allele carriage (OR=12.6, P=0.006), as compared to 8.4% of zapo individuals who did not carry the ADH1B*48His allele (genotype Arg/Arg).The percentage of individuals who consume non-beverage alcohol is lower (0.6%) in the subcohort of people with a higher education degree. This percentage is higher (6.0%, OR=10.0, P=0.004) in the subcohort of people without a higher education degree.",

The AEH gene from Xanthomonas rubrilineans (XrAEH) was recently cloned in this laboratory. The three-dimensional structure of XrAEH was simulated using the homology modeling method for rational design experiments. The analysis of the active site was performed, and its structure was specified. The key amino acid residues in the active site - the catalytic triad (Ser175, His341 and Asp308), oxyanion hole (Tyr83 and Tyr176), and carboxylate cluster (carboxylate groups of Asp209, Glu310 and Asp311) - were identified. It was shown that the optimal configuration of residues in the active site occurs with a negative net charge -1 in the carboxylate cluster. Docking of different substrates in the AEH active site was carried out, which allowed us to obtain structures of XrAEH complexes with the ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, D-phenylglycine, and 4-hydroxy-D-phenylglycine methyl ester. Modeling of XrAEH enzyme complexes with various substrates was used to show the structures for whose synthesis this enzyme will show the highest efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In modern life sciences, the issue of a specific, exogenously directed manipulation of a cells biochemistry is a highly topical one. In the case of electrically excitable cells, the aim of the manipulation is to control the cells electrical activity, with the result being either excitation with subsequent generation of an action potential or inhibition and suppression of the excitatory currents. The techniques of electrical activity stimulation are of particular significance in tackling the most challenging basic problem: figuring out how the nervous system of higher multicellular organisms functions. At this juncture, when neuroscience is gradually abandoning the reductionist approach in favor of the direct investigation of complex neuronal systems, minimally invasive methods for brain tissue stimulation are becoming the basic element in the toolbox of those involved in the field. In this review, we describe three approaches that are based on the delivery of exogenous, genetically encoded molecules sensitive to external stimuli into the nervous tissue. These approaches include optogenetics (Part I) as well as chemogenetics and thermogenetics (Part II), which are significantly different not only in the nature of the stimuli and structure of the appropriate effector proteins, but also in the details of experimental applications. The latter circumstance is an indication that these are rather complementary than competing techniques.",

    "abstract": "Cell regulation of Ph +cell proliferation and differentiation has been studied ex vivo in various chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. The regulation is provided by alternation of effective stages of proliferation and maturation with inhibition of Ph+ cell proliferation by accumulating neutrophils under apoptosis blockage. The alternation of stages consists of switching stage 1 (effective proliferation) to stage 2 (effective maturation) and proceeds according to the 1/2 -1/2/1 or 2/1-2/1/2/1 schemes. The kinetic plots of alternations pass through control points of crossing plots, where the parameters of proliferation and maturation are equal. The indices of P/D efficiency (ratio of proliferation and maturation rates) are 1.06±0.23 and don’t depend on time, alternation order, or sources of Ph+ cells – CML patients. During stages alternation, conversely, the parameters of Ph + cell proliferation and maturation vary. The proliferation stages are characterized by increased proliferating cells content, a decreased number of neutrophils, and apoptosis induction. At the maturation stages, conversely, apoptosis is inhibited, the number of mature neutrophils increases, while immature Ph + cells decrease. High content neutrophils inhibit the proliferation of Ph + cells and impair their own maturation by inversion of maturation order, probably through a feedback mechanism. The regulation differences ex vivo reveal three types of Ph + cells from various individual CML patients, distinguished by the number and duration of alternating stages of proliferation and maturation. Ph + cells types 1 and 2 have one prolonged stage of effective proliferation or effective maturation with efficiency indices P/D 1 = 1-20 or P/D 2 ≤ 1. At the same time period, the proliferation and differentiation of the Ph + cells type 3 proceeds with repeated alternations of stages with P/D 1 = 1-4 or P/D 2 ≤ 1. Type 1 Ph + cells (~20%) were isolated from patients in advanced stages of CML, while Ph + cells types 2 and 3 (30 and 50% correspondingly) were isolated from CML chronic phase patients sensitive to chemotherapy.",

The study was performed in 4 mouse groups: group 1 (study group): Tg+ mice intranasally injected with the peptide at a dose of 250 g/kg; group 2 (active control): Tg+ mice intranasally injected with normal saline; group 3 (control 1): Tg- mice; and group 4 (control 2): C57Bl/6 mice. The cognitive functions were evaluated using three tests: the novel object recognition test, the conditioned passive avoidance task, and the Morris water maze. The results testify to the fact that the pharmaceutical substance (PhS) based on the AF of HLDF-6 peptide at a dose of 250 g/kg administered intranasally efficiently restores the disturbed cognitive functions in transgenic mice. These results are fully consistent with the data obtained in animal models of Alzheimers disease induced by the injection of the beta-amyloid (A) fragment 25-35 into the giant-cell nucleus basalis of Meynert or by co-injection of the A fragment 25-35 and ibotenic acid into the hippocampus, and the model of ischemia stroke (chronic bilateral occlusion of carotids, 2VO). According to the overall results, PhS based on AF HLDF-6 was chosen as an object for further investigation; the dose of 250 g/kg was used as an effective therapeutic dose.

It was shown that the ratios of liposomes exhibiting noticeable phase separation decrease in the series POPC, DOPC, DPoPC regardless of any high-Tmelt lipid. Substitution of SM for TMCL led to increased lipid phase segregation. Taking into account the fact that the first and second cases corresponded to a reduction in the thickness of the lipid domains enriched in low- and high-Tmelt lipids, respectively, our findings indicate that the phase behavior depends on thickness mismatch between the ordered and disordered domains. The dipole modifiers, flavonoids and styrylpyridinium dyes, reduced the phase segregation of membranes composed of SM, Chol, and POPC (or DOPC). The other ternary lipid mixtures tested were not affected by the addition of dipole modifiers. It is suggested that dipole modifiers address the hydrophobic mismatch through fluidization of the ordered and disordered domains. The ability of a modifier to partition into the membrane and fluidize the domains was dictated by the hydrophobicity of modifier molecules, their geometric shape, and the packing density of domain-forming lipids. Phloretin, RH 421, and RH 237 proved the most potent among all the modifiers examined.",

    "abstract": "Studies of ancient DNA specimens started 25 years ago. At that time short mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments were the main targets in ancient DNA studies. The last three years were especially productive in the development of new methods of DNA purification and analysis. Complete mtDNA molecules and relatively large fragments of nuclear DNA are the targets of ancient DNA studies today. Ancient DNA studies allowed us to study organisms that went extinct more than ten thousand years ago, to reconstruct their phenotypic traits and evolution. Ancient DNA analyses can help understand the development of ancient human populations and how they migrated. A new evolutionary hypothesis and reconstruction of the biota history have been re-created from recent ancient DNA data. Some peculiarities and problems specific to the study of ancient DNA were revealed, such as very limited amounts of DNA available for study, the short length of the DNA fragments, breaks and chemical modifications in DNA molecules that result in \"postmortem\" mutations or complete blockage of DNA replication in vitro. The same specific features of DNA analysis were revealed for specimens from complicated forensic cases that result in the lack of experimental data or interpretation problems.. Here, we list the specific features of ancient DNA methodology and describe some achievements in fundamental and applied research of ancient DNA, including our own work in the field.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial Sodium Channels (ENaCs) are expressed in different organs and tissues, particularly in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) in the kidney, where they fine tune sodium reabsorption. Dynamic rearrangements of the cytoskeleton are one of the common mechanisms of ENaC activity regulation. In our previous studies, we showed that the actin-binding proteins cortactin and Arp2/3 complex are involved in the cytoskeleton-dependent regulation of ENaC and that their cooperative work decreases a channel's probability of remaining open; however, the specific mechanism of interaction between actin-binding proteins and ENaC is unclear. In this study, we propose a new component for the protein machinery involved in the regulation of ENaC, the missing-in-metastasis (MIM) protein. The MIM protein contains an IMD domain (for interaction with PIP2 -rich plasma membrane regions and Rac GTPases; this domain also possesses F-actin bundling activity), a PRD domain (for interaction with cortactin), and a WH2 domain (interaction with G-actin). The patch-clamp electrophysiological technique in whole-cell configuration was used to test the involvement of MIM in the actin-dependent regulation of ENaC. Co-transfection of ENaC subunits with the wild-type MIM protein (or its mutant forms) caused a significant reduction in ENaC-mediated integral ion currents. The analysis of the F-actin structure after the transfection of MIM plasmids showed the important role played by the domains PRD and WH2 of the MIM protein in cytoskeletal rearrangements. These results suggest that the MIM protein may be a part of the complex of actin-binding proteins which is responsible for the actin-dependent regulation of ENaC in the CCD.",

On the other hand, E1A expression increases cell sensitivity to a number of cytotoxic agents. Therefore, E1A is a candidate for use as a component of combination therapy for malignant tumors. The highest augmentation in the cytotoxic effect was achieved by a combined use of E1A expression and histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors. However, HDAC inhibitors do not induce apoptosis in cells transformed with E1A and cHa-ras oncogenes. In this study, it was shown that HDAC inhibitors reduce the expression of adenoviral E1A. However, under unregulated E1A overexpression, these cells undergo apoptosis in the presence of HDAC inhibitors. Treatment with a HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate (NaBut), was shown to activate the anti-apoptotic factor NF-kB in control cells. However, NaBut was unable to modulate the NF-kB activity in E1A overexpressed cells. Therefore, it is fair to postulate that cells transformed with E1A and cHa-ras oncogenes avoid the apoptosis induced by HDAC inhibitors thanks to a NaBut-dependent decrease in E1A expression.",

In this study, we investigated the reprogramming of rat fibroblasts with a deleted locus encoding a cluster comprising 14 miRNAs (from miR-743a to miR-465). The deletion of this locus was demonstrated to decrease significantly the efficiency of the cell reprogramming. In addition, the cells produced by the reprogramming differed from rat embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, which was an indication that reprogramming in these cells had not been completed.

In this work, tissue-specific expression of LL35/Falcor lncRNA has been shown in mouse liver and lungs. The use of antisense oligonucleotides allowed us to achieve LL35/Falcor lncRNA downregulation by 90%. As a result, the level of Foxa2 mRNA and protein dropped, which confirms the involvement of LL35/Falcor lncRNA in the regulation of transcription factor Foxa2. We have shown a decrease in the expression of LL35 lncRNA in liver fibrosis, which correlates with the previously published data for mRNA Foxa2. Thus, lncRNA LL35 regulates Foxa2 expression in the liver not only in normal conditions, but also during development of fibrosis, which allows one to consider lncRNA a biomarker of this pathological process.",

В острой фазе инфекции Tat связывается с РНК шпилькой в начале транскрибируемой вирусной РНК и привлекает комплекс P-TEFb, который гиперфосфорилирует РНК-полимеразу II и запускает элонгацию транскрипции.

    "abstract": "The studies of cell plasticity and differentiation abilities are important problems in modern cellular biology. The use of histone deacetylase inhibitor - valproic acid is a promising approach to increasing the differentiation efficiency of various cell types. In this paper we investigate the ability of mouse submandibular salivary gland cells to differentiate into the hepatic direction and the effect of valproic acid on the efficiency of this differentiation. It was shown that the gene expression levels of hepatocyte markers (Aat, Afp, G6p, Pepck, Tat, Cyp3a13) and liver-enriched transcription factors (Hnf-3, Hnf-3, Hnf-4, Hnf-6) were increased after differentiation in salivary gland cells. Valproic acid increases the specificity of hepatic differentiation, reducing the expression levels of the ductal (Krt19, Hhex1, Cyp7a1) and acinar (Ptf1a) markers. After valproic acid exposure, the efficiency of hepatic differentiation also increases, as evidenced by the increase in the gene expression level of Alb and Tdo, and increase in urea production by differentiated cells. No change was found in DNA methylation of the promoter regions of the genes; however, valproic acid treatment and subsequent hepatic differentiation largely affected the histone H3 methylation of liver-enriched genes. Thus, mouse submandibular salivary gland cells are capable of effective differentiation in the hepatic direction. Valproic acid increases the specificity and efficiency of the hepatic differentiation of these cells.",

We show that GD-23 in a dose range of 0.05 to 0.5 mg/kg (i.p.) exhibits anxiolytic activity in the elevated plus maze test and nootropic activity in the object recognition test in scopolamine-induced amnesia in rodents. It was shown that GD-23 did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity, holding promise as a nonsedative anxiolytic agent. The anxiolytic and nootropic activities of GD-23 were abrogated by the TSPO specific ligand PK11195, which thus suggests a role for TSPO in mediating the pharmacological activity of GD-23.",

Expression of these genes correlates with regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by alternating proliferation and maturation stages for three main Ph+cell types that occur under chronic myeloid leukemia. Thep53, p21, mdm2, and gapdh genes overexpress in active proliferating myeloid cells in the cell cycle S+ G2/M phases and when the phases are coincident with the proliferation stage. Expression of these genes decreases to a considerable level under alternation of the Ph(+)cell proliferation and maturation stages and whenever the expression is greatly diminished under significant neutrophil accumulation and especially under repeated alternation of the stages. In the course of neutrophil maturation, gene expression levels decrease in the range of gapdh > actin > c-myc, bcr/abl,p21 > p53 > bcl2 > bax.The expression levels of these genes in neutrophils are lower than those in myelocytes and lower by an order of magnitude than that in the cells with a prolonged proliferation stage. TheBcr/ablexpression gene under prolonged maturation and neutrophil accumulation is inhibited; however it is enhanced by 2-3 times for the proliferation stage with myelocyte accumulation. Minimalbcr/ablexpression is observed under overexpression ofp53, mdm2, p21, c-myc,as well as under cell maximum at the S and G2/M phases.

Using 2D gels, the composition of the CD95 DISC was analyzed in the so-called Type I and Type II cells, which are characterized by different kinetics of apoptosis. The detailed analysis of the CD95 DISC performed by 2D gels demonstrated that, besides the well-established components of the CD95 DISC, which are present in both cell types (CD95, FADD and procaspase-8), there are a number of differential spots detected at the CD95 DISC of Type I versus Type II cells.

The self-assembly is initiated by interactions between 16S rRNA and three key ribosomal proteins: S4, S8, and S7. These proteins also have a regulatory function in the translation of their polycistronic operons recognizing a specific region of mRNA. Therefore, studying the RNAprotein interactions within binary complexes is obligatory for understanding ribosome biogenesis. The non-conventional RNAprotein contact within the binary complex of recombinant ribosomal protein S7 and its 16S rRNA binding site (236 nucleotides) was identified. UVinduced RNAprotein cross-links revealed that S7 cross-links to nucleotide U1321 of 16S rRNA. The careful consideration of the published RNA protein cross-links for protein S7 within the 30S subunit and their correlation with the X-ray data for the 30S subunit have been performed. The RNA protein crosslink within the binary complex identified in this study is not the same as the previously found cross-links for a subunit both in a solution, and in acrystal. The structure of the binary RNAprotein complex formed at the initial steps of self-assembly of the small subunit appears to be rearranged during the formation of the final structure of the subunit.",

In this article, we will discuss a new approach to the development of anticarcinogenic vaccines. The main task in our research was to select a benzo[a]pyrene immunomimetic peptide considered as a hapten-specific component. For this purpose, we synthesized carcinogen-protein conjugates and prepared mono- and polyclonal antibodies to benzo[a]pyrene. Phage display technology was used to select the benzo[a]pyrene immunomimetic peptide, followed by an evaluation of the immunological properties of the obtained peptide. The obtained benzo[a]pyrene immunomimetic peptide could only simulate chemical carcinogens in the frame of the pIII protein. As a result, we prepared a recombinant protein composed of the benzo[a]pyrene immunomimetic peptide and pIII-encoding sequences. Using ELISA, we demonstrated that the recombinant protein specifically interacts with the anti-benzo[a]pyrene monoclonal antibody (mAB B2). Using molecular modeling, we predicted the 3-D structure of the mAB B2 active center and analyzed the characteristics of its interaction with different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as with the benzo[a]pyrene immunomimetic peptide. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of the results of the obtainment of hapten-specific components of anticarcinogenic vaccines allowed us to outline a strategy for future development in this direction.",

CD44 and CD62L are among the major surface markers that allow us to define T-cell populations. The expression of these molecules depends on the functional status of a T lymphocyte. Under lymphopenic conditions, peripheral T cells undergo homeostatic proliferation and acquire the memory-like surface phenotype CD44hiCD62Lhi. However, the data on the functional activity of these cells remains controversial. In this paper, we analyzed the effects of the adoptive transfer of syngeneic splenocytes on the recovery of CD8+ T cells in sublethally irradiated mice. Our data demonstrate that under lymphopenia, donor lymphocytes form a population of memory-like CD8+ T cells with the phenotype CD122+CD5+CD49dhiCXCR3+ that shares the phenotypic characteristics of true memory cells and suppressive CD8+ T cells. Ex vivo experiments showed that after adoptive transfer in irradiated mice, T cells lacked the functions of true effector or memory cells; the allogeneic immune response and immune response to pathogens were greatly suppressed in these mice.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus infection named COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it has been responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in scores of countries. At the time this article was being written, the number of infected and deceased patients continued to grow worldwide. Most patients with severe forms of the disease suffer from pneumonia and pulmonary insufficiency; in many cases, the disease is generalized and causes multiple organ failures and a dysfunction of physiological systems. One of the most serious and prognostically ominous complications from COVID-19 is coagulopathy, in particular, decompensated hypercoagulability with the risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. In most cases, local and diffuse macro- and microthromboses are present, a condition which causes multiple-organ failure and thromboembolic complications. The causes and pathogenic mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 remain largely unclear, but they are associated with systemic inflammation, including the so-called cytokine storm. Despite the relatively short period of the ongoing pandemic, laboratory signs of serious hemostatic disorders have been identified and measures for specific prevention and correction of thrombosis have been developed. This review discusses the causes of COVID-19 coagulopathies and the associated complications, as well as possible approaches to their early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Among the many malignant neoplasms, glioblastoma (GBM) leads to one of the worst prognosis for patients and has an almost 100% recurrence rate. The only chemotherapeutic drug that is widely used for treating glioblastoma is temozolomide, a DNA alkylating agent. Its impact, however, is only minor; it increases patients survival just by 12 to 14 months. Multiple highly selective compounds that affect specific proteins and have performed well in other types of cancer have proved ineffective against glioblastoma. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel methods that could help achieve the long-awaited progress in glioblastoma treatment. One of the potentially promising approaches is the targeting of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These molecules are characterized by extremely high multifunctionality and often act as integrators by coordinating multiple key signaling pathways within the cell. Thus, the impact on ncRNAs has the potential to lead to a broader and stronger impact on cells, as opposed to the more focused action of inhibitors targeting specific proteins. In this review, we summarize the functions of long noncoding RNAs, circular RNAs, as well as microRNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs, small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs. We provide a classification of these transcripts and describe their role in various signaling pathways and physiological processes. We also provide examples of oncogenic and tumor suppressor ncRNAs belonging to each of these classes in the context of their involvement in the pathogenesis of gliomas and glioblastomas. In conclusion, we considered the potential use of ncRNAs as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of glioblastoma.",

With the help of the primer extension reaction, MALDI MS and DNA cleavage by thymine DNA glycosylase deamination of 5-methylcytosine residues has been shown to take place when the model methylated DNA duplexes are treated with nuclear extracts from the cell lines СНO, HeLa, and Skov3. The hypothesis that deamination of 5-methylcytosine is the first stage of demethylation in mammalia has been postulated.",

We investigated the functional regulatory polymorphisms of the SLAMF1 locus associated with autoimmune processes, using bioinformatics and a mutational analysis of the regulatory elements overlapping with polymorphic positions. In the reporter gene assay in MP-1 and Raji B-cell lines, the enhancer activity of the regulatory region of the locus containing the rs3753381 polymorphism demonstrated a twofold increase upon the introduction of the rs3753381 minor variant (G → A) associated with myasthenia gravis. An analysis of the nucleotide context in the vicinity of rs3753381 revealed that the minor version of this polymorphism improves several binding sites for the transcription factors of FOX and NFAT, and RXR nuclear receptors. All mutations that disrupt any of these sites lead to a decrease in the enhancer activity both in MP1 and in Raji cells, and each of the two B-cell lines expresses a specific set of these factors. Thus, the minor variant of the rs3753381 polymorphism may contribute to the development of myasthenia gravis by modulating SLAMF1 expression, presumably in pathogenic B-lymphocytes.",

    "abstract": "Induction of donor specific tolerance (DST) by the introduction of donor cells into a recipients portal vein is one of the approaches used to solve the problem of transplant engraftment. However, the mechanism of DST development remains unclear to this moment. In the present work, we first studied the change in the content of immunoproteasomes and macrophages of the liver at early stages of the development of allospecific portal tolerance in rats by Western blotting and flow cytofluorimetry. On the basis of the data obtained, we can conclude that the induction of DST is an active process characterized by two phases during which the level of the proteasome immune subunits LMP2 and LMP7 in liver mononuclear cells, including Kupffer cells, and the number of Kupffer cells change. The first phase lasts up to 5 days after the beginning of DST induction; the second phase - from 5 to 14 days. In both phases, the level of the subunits LMP2 and LMP7 in the total pool of mononuclear cells and Kupffer cells increases, with maximum values on days 1 and 7. In addition, the total number of Kupffer cells increases in both phases with a shift in several days. The most noticeable changes take place in the second phase. The third day is characterized by a lower content of mononuclear cells expressing immunoproteasomes compared to the control value in native animals. Presumably, at this time point a window of opportunity appears for subsequent filling of an empty niche with cells of different subpopulations and, depending on this fact, the development of tolerance or rejection. The results obtained raise the new tasks of finding ways to influence the cellular composition in the liver and the expression of immunoproteasomes on the third day after the beginning of DST induction to block the development of rejection.",

    "abstract": "The development of targeted toxins based on non-immunoglobulin targeting molecules appears to be one of the most advanced approaches in the targeted therapy of malignant tumors with a high expression of the HER2 receptor. Earlier, we showed that the targeted toxin DARPin-PE40 consisting of the HER2-specific non-immunoglobulin polypeptide (the targeting module) and a fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (the toxic module) exhibits an antitumor effect in vivo against the HER2-positive adenocarcinoma xenograft. In this work, an in-depth analysis of the effect of DARPin-PE40 on the growth dynamics of experimental xenograft tumors was carried out. DARPin-PE40 was shown to inhibit tumor growth at a dose of 25 and 50 g/animal and to cause tumor node reduction at a dose of 80 g/animal, followed by growth resumption at the end of therapy. An evaluation of the tumor growth dynamics revealed statistically significant differences in tumor volume in mice in the experimental groups compared to the control group. The results testify to the potential of using the created targeted toxin as an agent for the targeted therapy of HER2-overexpressing tumors.",

The total number of generated data resulted in 108.3 billion base pairs (60.2 billion from Illumina technology and 48.1 billion from SOLiD technology). Statistics performed on reads generated by GAII and SOLiD showed that they covered 75% and 96% of the genome respectively. Short polymorphic regions were detected with comparable accuracy however, the absolute amount of them revealed by SOLiD was several times less than by GAII. Optimal algorithm for using the latest methods of sequencing was established for the analysis of individual human genomes.

Under acidic conditions (up to pH = 3.0), there was no significant decrease in the total conductance of the YrOmpF channel reconstituted into the bilayer. The studied channel significantly differed from the porins of other bacteria by high values of its critical closing potential (Vc): Vc = 232 mV at pH = 7.0 and Vc = 164 mV at pH = 5.0. A theoretical model of the YrOmpF spatial structure was used for the analysis of the charge distribution in the mouth and inside the channel to explain these properties and quantitatively assess the bonds between the amino acid residues in the L3 loop and on the inner wall of the barrel. The parameters of YrOmpF were compared with those of the classical OmpF porin from E. coli. The results of electrophysiological experiments and theoretical analysis are discussed in terms of the mechanism for voltage-dependent closing of porin channels.",

The basic therapy for pemfigus includes systemic corticosteroids, but their use should be as brief as possible because of the severe side effects. In cases of corticosteroid- resistant pemfigus, adjuvant therapy, in particular extracorporeal methods, is used. The most effective and safest extracorporeal therapy is immunosorbtion. Immunosorbtion is based on the removal of pemphigus antibodies from the blood using an affinity sorbent during a therapeutic apheresis procedure. Existing immunosorbents are nonselective and increase the risk of infection. We designed an immunosorbent based on an agarose matrix, Affi-Gel 15, and human recombinant desmoglein 3, as a ligand, for a selective removal of autoantibodies from pemphigus patients' sera. It was shown on a pemphigus experimental model in vivo (neonatal Balb/c mouse model) and in vitro that the immunosorbent can effectively remove desmoglein 3-associated autoantibodies. The experimental results demonstrate that the solid-phase matrix immunosorbent Affi-Gel 15-Dsg3 is a promising product for the development of pemphigus therapy.",

In addition to mutations, many polymorphisms have been identified in this gene, and one of these is a dinucleotide microsatellite: SNCA-Rep1. The mechanisms by which specific configurations of SNCA-Rep1 may contribute to the development of this disease have yet to be clarified. In our study, a relationship between long SNCA-Rep1 alleles and Parkinson's was confirmed in the Russian population. Long allelic variants of SNCA-Rep1 were shown to be associated with the hypomethylation of the CpG-sites in intron 1 of the SNCA gene. Long variants of SNCA-Rep1 are supposed to exert their effect through the hypomethylation of a transcriptionally significant region of this gene. Hypomethylation is usually associated with increased expression, which, in turn, contributes to alpha-synuclein accumulation in neuronal cytoplasm, with the latter being the main molecular marker of Parkinson's disease. Further studies are needed to establish a relationship between our finding and SNCA gene expression.",

Identification of aberrantly methylated sites in tumor DNA is considered to be the first step in the development of epigenetic PCR test systems for early diagnosis of cancer. Recently, we have developed a GLAD-PCR assay, a method for detecting the R(5mC)GY site in the genome position of interest even at significant excess of DNA molecules with a non-methylated RCGY site in this location. The aim of the present work is to use the GLAD-PCR assay to detect the aberrantly methylated R(5mC)GY sites in the regulatory regions of tumor suppressor genes (brinp1, bves, cacna2d3, cdh11, cpeb1, epha7, fgf2, galr1, gata4, hopx, hs3st2, irx1, lrrc3b, pcdh10, rprm, runx3, sfrp2, sox17, tcf21, tfpi2, wnt5a, zfp82, and znf331) in DNA samples obtained from gastric cancer (GC) tissues. The study of the DNA samples derived from 29 tumor and 25 normal gastric tissue samples demonstrated a high diagnostic potential of the selected RCGY sites in the regulatory regions of the irx1, cacna2d3, and epha7 genes; the total indices of sensitivity and specificity for GC detection being 96.6% and 100%, respectively.",

ASC may be considered an epigenetic drug capable of reducing aberrant DNA and histone hypermethylation, which could be helpful in the treatment of some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. The clinical potency of ASC is also associated with regenerative medicine; in particular with the production of iPSCs. The effect of ASC on somatic cell reprogramming is most convincingly explained by a combined enhancement of the activity of the enzymes involved in the active demethylation of DNA and histones. This review describes how ASC can affect the epigenetic status of a cell and how it can be used in anticancer therapy and stem cell reprogramming.",

Однако только данных о нуклеотидных последовательностях геномов недостаточно для понимания функциональных взаимосвязей отдельных элементов геномов и их роли в формировании фенотипических признаков и патогенезе отдельных заболеваний. В постгеномную эпоху активно развиваются методы, позволяющие манипулировать с ДНК в геномах, а также визуализировать и управлять экспрессией генов и работой регуляторных элементов. Тем не менее далеко не все методы отвечают высоким требованиям к их эффективности, безопасности и доступности для широкого круга исследователей. В последние несколько лет появились новейшие методы редактирования геномов - это системы TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) и CRISPR (Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9. Эти появившиеся относительно недавно системы уже зарекомендовали себя как эффективные и надежные инструменты геномной инженерии. Данный обзор в основном посвящен применению указанных систем для редактирования геномов основных модельных объектов современной биологии, а также для функционального скрининга геномов, создания клеточных моделей наследственных заболеваний человека, изучения эпигеномов и визуализации клеточных процессов. Кроме того, рассмотрены основные методы конструирования подобных систем, проанализировано их действие, обсуждаются некоторые проблемы, которые ожидают сследователей при применении этих инструментов редактирования геномов.",

При этом у взрослых животных электрофизиологические эффекты, наблюдаемые при избирательной стимуляции М3-рецепторов в миокарде, крайне малы по сравнению с эффектами стимуляции М2-рецепторов. Нами изучено действие избирательной стимуляции М3-рецепторов путем аппликации агониста мускариновых рецепторов пилокарпина (10 мкМ) на фоне блокирования М2-рецепторов селективным антагонистом метоктрамином (100 нМ) на конфигурацию потенциалов действия (ПД) в препаратах предсердного и желудочкового миокарда новорожденных и трехнедельных крысят в сравнении с эффектами в миокарде взрослых крыс. В предсердном миокарде стимуляция М3-рецепторов вызывала уменьшение длительности ПД приблизительно одинаково выраженное у новорожденных и взрослых крыс, в то время как у трехнедельных крысят отсутствовал статистически значимый эффект. Эффект, развивающийся в желудочковом миокарде новорожденных крысят, более чем в 3 раза превосходил эффект у взрослых животных, у трехнедельных животных эффект отсутствовал. В препаратах всех типов действие стимуляции М3-рецепторов на электрическую активность полностью снималось их селективным антагонистом 4-DAMP (10 нМ). Согласно данным РВ-ПЦР, количество мРНК гена М3-рецепторов как в предсердном, так и в желудочковом миокарде снижается по мере взросления животного. Можно заключить, что вклад М3-рецепторов в реализацию холинергических воздействий на миокард снижается в постнатальном онтогенезе, что связано с уменьшением экспрессии гена М3-рецепторов по сравнению с геном М2-рецепторов.",

    "abstract": "Non-enzymatic protein glycation is a source of metabolic stress that contributes to cytotoxicity and tissue damage. Hyperglycemia has been linked to elevation of advanced glycation endproducts, which mediate much of the vascular pathology leading to diabetic complications. Enhanced glycation of immunoglobulins and their accelerated vascular clearance is proposed as a natural mechanism to intercept alternative advanced glycation endproducts, thereby mitigating microvascular disease. We reported that antibodies against the glycoprotein KLH have elevated reactivity for glycopeptides from diabetic serum. These reactions are mediated by covalent binding between antibody light chains and carbonyl groups of glycated peptides. Diabetic animals that were immunized to induce reactive antibodies had attenuated diabetic nephropathy, which correlated with reduced levels of circulating and kidney-bound glycation products. Molecular analysis of antibody glycation revealed the preferential modification of light chains bearing germline-encoded lambda V regions. We previously noted that antibody fragments carrying V regions in the germline configuration are selected from a human Fv library by covalent binding to a reactive organophosphorus ester. These Fv fragments were specifically modified at light chain V region residues, which map to the combining site at the interface between light and heavy chains. These findings suggest that covalent binding is an innate property of antibodies, which may be encoded in the genome for specific physiological purposes. This hypothesis is discussed in context with current knowledge of the natural antibodies that recognize altered self molecules and the catalytic autoantibodies found in autoimmune disease.",

In the excess of hydrogen peroxide, the decrease in enzyme activity follows first-order kinetics. Therefore, the first-order effective inactivation kinetic constants determined for various FDH forms at a constant H 2O 2 concentration can be used as a quantitative measure of the enzyme stability. It was shown that two cysteine residues located in the active site formate- and coenzyme-binding domains (Cysl45 and Cys255, respectively) make similar contributions to the enzyme stability, while the contribution of Cys354 is insignificant. The inactivation kinetics of wild-type PseFDH, mutant PseFDH Cysl45Ser/Cys255Ala, and FDH produced under stress conditions by bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, higher plants Arabidopsis thaliana, and soya Glycine max, was studied. It was found that the stress-induced FDHs are at least 20 times more stable than the nonstress-induced PseFDH from Pseudomonas sp. 101 grown on methanol.",

Some mutants demonstrated remarkably improved catalytic activity. Moreover, mutation of βF71 residue allowed to enhance penicillin acylase enantioselectivity. The catalytic activity to the specific substrates was improved up to 36 times, most notably for K, R, and L mutants. Increased activity to a D-phenylglycine derivative – a valuable specificity improvement for biocatalytic synthesis of new penicillins and cephalosporins – was shown for βF71R and βF71L mutants. The synthetic capacity of penicillin acylase with 6-aminopenicillanic acid as an external nucleophile was especially sensitive to mutation of the β71 residue in contrast to the synthesis with 7-aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid.",

    "abstract": "The last case of natural smallpox was recorded in October, 1977. It took humanity almost 20 years to achieve that feat after the World Health Organization had approved the global smallpox eradication program. Vaccination against smallpox was abolished, and, during the past 40 years, the human population has managed to lose immunity not only to smallpox, but to other zoonotic orthopoxvirus infections as well. As a result, multiple outbreaks of orthopoxvirus infections in humans in several continents have been reported over the past decades. The threat of smallpox reemergence as a result of evolutionary transformations of these zoonotic orthopoxviruses exists. Modern techniques for the diagnostics, prevention, and therapy of smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections are being developed today.",

A panel of DNA immunogens has been developed, some are already in the clinical trials. However, the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines, specifically of those applied to humans, needs a considerable improvement. There are several approaches to increase DNA vaccine immunogenicity. One approach implies the modifications of the encoded immunogen that change its processing and presentation, and thus the overall pattern of anti-immunogen response. For this, eukaryotic expression vectors are constructed that encode the chimeric proteins composed of the immunogen and specialized targeting or signal sequences. The review describes a number of signals that if fused to immunogen, target it into the predefined subcellular compartments. The review gives examples of their application for DNA-immunization.",

Compared to widely used BOX-PCR and ribotyping methods, our system features higher resolution allowing differentiation of closely related isolates that appear identical in BOX-PCR and ribotyping but differ in their phage sensitivity. The IS1-profiling system is less sensitive to the quality of the material and equipment used. At the same time, BOX-PCR is more universal and suitable for bacterial strain grouping and reconstruction of the low-distance phylogeny. Thus, our system represents an important supplement to the existing set of tools for bacterial strain differentiation; it is particularly valuable for a detailed investigation of highly divergent and rapidly evolving natural bacterial populations and for studies on coliphage ecology. However, some isolates could not be reliably differentiated by IS1-PCR, because of the low number of bands in their patterns. For improvement of IS1-fingerprinting characteristics, we offer to modify the system by introducing the second primer TR8834 hybridizing to the sequence of a transposase gene that is widely spread in enterobacterial genomes.",

Our constructed plasmids containing bulky nFlu or nAnt lesions near the tagrfp gene promoter were shown to undergo repair in eukaryotic cells (HEK 293T) and that they can be used to analyze the efficiency of NER ex vivo. A comparative analysis of the time dependence of fluorescent cells accumulation after transfection with nFlu- and nAnt-DNA revealed that there are differences in how efficient their repair by the NER system of HEK 293T cells can be.

    "abstract": "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a safer type of HSCT than allogeneic HSCT, is a promising therapy for patients with severe autoimmune diseases (ADs). Despite the long history of medical practice, structural changes in the adaptive immune system as a result of autologous HSCT in patients with various types of ADs remain poorly understood. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate the structural changes in the peripheral blood T-cell repertoire in adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) during two years after autologous HSCT. The implementation of unique molecular identifiers allowed us to substantially reduce the impact of the biases occurring during the preparation of libraries, to carry out a comparative analysis of the various properties of the T-cell repertoire between different time points, and to track the dynamics of both distinct T-cell clonotypes and T-cell subpopulations. In the first year of the reconstitution, clonal diversity of the T-cell repertoire remained lower than the initial one in both patients. During the second year after HSCT, clonal diversity continued to increase and reached a normal value in one of the patients. The increase in the diversity was associated with the emergence of a large number of low-frequency clonotypes, which were not identified before HSCT. Efficiency of clonotypes detection after HSCT was dependent on their abundance in the initial repertoire. Almost all of the 100 most abundant clonotypes observed before HSCT were detected 2 years after transplantation and remained highly abundant irrespective of their CD4+ or CD8+ phenotype. A total of up to 25% of peripheral blood T cells 2 years after HSCT were represented by clonotypes from the initial repertoire.",

Much of the research focused on HIV-1 prevention through vaccination is aimed at developing immunogens and immunization strategies to induce the formation of antibodies with neutralizing activity against a broad range of HIV-1 isolates (bNAbs). The objective of this study was to develop immunogens capable of targeting an immune response to MPER, one of the regions of bNAb binding in Env. Two immunogens carrying MPER fragments on their scaffolds (protein YkuJ Bacillus subtilis and artificial polypeptide TBI) were constructed. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to show that the secondary structure of the immunogens was consistent with their theoretical models. The antigenic structure of the MPER-TBI and YkuJ-MPER proteins was characterized using bNAbs that recognize HIV-1 MPER (2F5, 4E10, and 10E8). The rabbit model made it possible to show the immunogenicity of the constructed recombinant proteins. The resulting serum was found to be cross-reactive with immunogens carrying MPER. The constructs designed and characterized in this study can be used for targeting the humoral immune response to MPER, which is known to be one of the sites of HIV-1 vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a safer type of HSCT than allogeneic HSCT, is a promising therapy for patients with severe autoimmune diseases (ADs). Despite the long history of medical practice, structural changes in the adaptive immune system as a result of autologous HSCT in patients with various types of ADs remain poorly understood. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate the structural changes in the peripheral blood T-cell repertoire in adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) during two years after autologous HSCT. The implementation of unique molecular identifiers allowed us to substantially reduce the impact of the biases occurring during the preparation of libraries, to carry out a comparative analysis of the various properties of the T-cell repertoire between different time points, and to track the dynamics of both distinct T-cell clonotypes and T-cell subpopulations. In the first year of the reconstitution, clonal diversity of the T-cell repertoire remained lower than the initial one in both patients. During the second year after HSCT, clonal diversity continued to increase and reached a normal value in one of the patients. The increase in the diversity was associated with the emergence of a large number of low-frequency clonotypes, which were not identified before HSCT. Efficiency of clonotypes detection after HSCT was dependent on their abundance in the initial repertoire. Almost all of the 100 most abundant clonotypes observed before HSCT were detected 2 years after transplantation and remained highly abundant irrespective of their CD4+ or CD8+ phenotype. A total of up to 25% of peripheral blood T cells 2 years after HSCT were represented by clonotypes from the initial repertoire.",

Известно, что в линии клеток К562 хронической миелогенной лейкемии человека экспрессируются протон-управляемые ионные каналы ASIC1, которые являются молекулярной мишенью трехпетельных токсинов из яда черной мамбы ( Dendroaspis polylepis ) – мамбалгинов. Мамбалгины эффективно ингибируют гомо- и гетеромерные рецепторы, содержащие субъединицу ASIC1a, однако возможность их использования в качестве противоопухолевых агентов ранее не исследовалась. С помощью метода патч-кламп нами впервые обнаружена активация протон-управляемых ионных каналов ASIC1a в клетках К562 в ответ на снижение внеклеточного рН. Показано, что рекомбинантный мамбалгин-2 ингибирует активность ASIC1a и тормозит пролиферацию клеток К562 с полумаксимальной эффективной концентрацией ЕС 50 ~ 0.2 мкМ. Максимальный ингибирующий эффект мамбалгина-2 достигается после 72-часовой инкубации с клетками и при достижении рН клеточной среды ~ 6.6. В клетках К562 мамбалгин-2 вызывает арест клеточного цикла в фазе G1 и снижает фосфорилирование регуляторов фазы G1 клеточного цикла – циклина D1 и циклинзависимой киназы CDK4, не влияя на активацию киназы CDK6. Полученные результаты свидетельствуют о возможности создания на основе мамбалгина-2 новых противолейкозных препаратов.",

    "abstract": "Некоторые представители парамиксовирусов обладают онколитической активностью и могут использоваться в качестве противоопухолевых агентов. Такие парамиксовирусы включают непатогенные (аттенуированные) штаммы вирусов кори, вируса болезни Ньюкасла и вируса Сендай. Все эти вирусы и вирус Сендай, в частности, способны вызывать в большой степени специфическую гибель именно злокачественных, но не нормальных клеток. Гибель злокачественных клеток происходит за счет прямого цитолитического действия вируса, а также как следствие активации противоопухолевого иммунитета. Преимущественное взаимодействие парамиксовирусов со злокачественными клетками происходит за счет того, что эти клетки в избытке продуцируют некоторые гликопротеины, способные служить рецепторами для онколитических парамиксовирусов. Кроме того, частые генетические дефекты раковых клеток в системе интерферонового и апоптозного ответов создают благоприятные условия для репликации вируса именно в злокачественных клетках. Парамиксовирусы могут усиливать образование многоядерных клеточных конгломератов (синцитиев), что ускоряет вовлечение новых клеток в инфекционный процесс внутри опухоли и позволяет вирусу ускользать от нейтрализующего воздействия антител. Все эти факторы способствуют эффективному внутриопухолевому распространению вирусной инфекции и массовой гибели злокачественных клеток. Кроме того, онколитические парамиксовирусы способны вызывать иммуноопосредованную гибель злокачественных клеток. Они действуют как мощные индукторы интерферона и других цитокинов, стимулирующих противоопухолевую активность различных клеточных компонентов иммунного ответа, таких, как дендритные клетки, натуральные киллеры и цитотоксические Т-лимфоциты. Обнадеживающие результаты, полученные в различных исследованиях, проводимых с онколитическими парамиксовирусами, можно объяснить действием указанных механизмов.",

Сердцем этой системы является теломеразный комплекс, в который входят фермент обратная транскриптаза и теломеразная РНК, служащая матрицей для синтеза теломерных повторов на концах хромосом. В результате биоинформатического сравнения структуры гена теломеразной РНК (TER) и его промоторного участка долгоживущего голого землекопа Heterocephalus glaber и TER других видов найдены два основных отличия теломеразной РНК H. glaber (hgTER). Это замена A → G в первой петле псевдоузла P2b-p3, что соответствует нуклеотиду 111 в теломеразной РНК человека (hTR), и замена G → A в домене CR7-p8b (соответствует нуклеотиду 421 hTR). Анализ промоторных участков гена TER позволил идентифицировать два новых сайта связывания факторов транскрипции: сайт взаимодействия с белками семейства ETS, найденный в промоторных участках генов всех проанализированных TER, и сайт связывания фактора SOX17, уникальный для TER голого землекопа. Еще одной отличительной чертой гена hgTER оказалось отсутствие одного из Sp1-сайтов. Особенности hgTER и регуляции ее транскрипции могут рассматриваться как один из важных факторов, обеспечивающих повышенную теломеразную активность в стволовых клетках H. glaber и увеличение продолжительности его жизни.",

Возбудитель сибирской язвы - грамположительная капсулообразующая аэробная палочка Bacillus anthracis . Для предотвращения заболеваний людей сибирской язвой необходимы эффективные вакцинные препараты, способные быстро индуцировать стойкий иммунный ответ. В данной работе сконструированы три рекомбинантных аденовируса человека серотипа 5, содержащих различные модификации нуклеотидных последовательностей, кодирующих четвертый домен протективного антигена (РА). Все три модификации протективного антигена - секретируемый (Ad-sPA), несекретируемый (Ad-cPA) и протективный антиген, соединенный с Fc-фрагментом иммуноглобулина IgG2a (Ad-PA-Fc), обладали защитными свойствами против B. anthracis . Наиболее высокий уровень протекции, выразившийся в способности защищать мышей от гибели после заражения летальной дозой B. anthracis, индуцировал рекомбинантный аденовирус Ad-PA-Fc.

Проведен биоинформатический анализ рН-сенсорного потенциала всех трех членов семейства рецептора инсулина различных видов животных (от лягушки до человека), а также их химер с перестановкой отдельных доменов внеклеточной части. С использованием программы AcalPred показано, что семейство рецептора инсулина делится на белки, активность которых максимальна в кислой среде (все ортологи рецепторов инсулина и инсулиноподобного фактора роста, за исключением одного ортолога IGF-IR из Xenopus laevis) или в щелочной среде (все ортологи IRR). Предсказано также, что на рН-чувствительность рецептора IRR наиболее существенно будет влиять замена доменов L1 и C в его внеклеточной части, а также второго и третьего фибронектинового повторов. Замена домена L2 будет, предположительно, наименее чувствительной для активации IRR при щелочных значениях рН. Для проверки предсказаний in silico получены три конструкции с заменой первых доменов L1C рецептора IRR, третьего домена L2 и всех трех доменов L1CL2 на аналогичные участки рецептора инсулиноподобного фактора роста. Установлено, что замена доменов L1C и трех доменов L1CL2 уменьшает способность рецептора к активации при щелочных рН, что приводит к увеличению полумаксимальной эффективной концентрации почти в 2 раза, а замена домена L2 увеличивает полумаксимальную эффективную концентрацию на 40%. Таким образом, наши данные свидетельствуют о высоком предсказательном потенциале алгоритма AcalPred не только для рН-чувствительных ферментов, но и для рН-регулируемых рецепторов.",

В составе биопленки бактерии становятся устойчивыми к антибиотикам и иммунной системе человека, что вызывает трудности при лечении и определяет необходимость разработки ингибиторов формирования биопленки. Бактерии Bacillus subtilis широко используются в качестве модельного организма для изучения образования биопленок. Изучено влияние новых синтезированных 2(5H)-фуранонов на формирование биопленок клетками бацилл. Из 57 проверенных соединений образование биопленки подавляли серусодержащие производные 2(5H)-фуранона F12, F15 и F94, взятые в концентрации 10 мкг/мл. Показано, что F12 и F94 подавляли биосинтез GFP с промотора оперона eps, кодирующего гены синтеза экзополисахарида биопленки (EPS). Методом дифференциального флуоресцентного окрашивания установлено, что в присутствии F12, F15 и F94 значительно повышается чувствительность клеток бацилл к воздействию антибиотиков (канамицин и хлорамфеникол). Максимальный эффект оказывал F12. F15 разрушал уже сформированную биопленку и значительно повышал чувствительность бактерий к антибиотикам.",

Показано, что Ноопепт (10 мкМ) увеличивал ДНК-связывающую активность только HIF-1 и не влиял на активность CREB, NFAT, NF-κB, p53, STAT1, GAS, VDR и HSF1. Выраженность HIF-позитивного эффекта Ноопепта зависела от его концентрации. В условиях стабилизации HIF-1, вызванной индуктором гипоксии СоCl2, Ноопепт обеспечивал дополнительное повышение ДНК-связывающей активности HIF-1. Пирацетам (1 мМ) не вызывал значимых изменений ДНК-связывающей активности ТФ. Результаты молекулярного докинга показали, что Ноопепт (L-изомер), а также метаболит Ноопепта - L-изомер N-фенилацетилпролина - способны связываться с активным сайтом пролилгидроксилазы 2. Данные о вызываемом Ноопептом селективном увеличении ДНК-связывающей активности HIF-1 с учетом функциональной значимости генов, активируемых этим фактором транскрипции, объясняют выявленные ранее нейрохимические и фармакологические эффекты Ноопепта, что дает основание рассматривать HIF-позитивный эффект в качестве первичного механизма действия этого дипептида.",

    "abstract": "В настоящее время трансплантация клеток пуповинной крови активно применяется в клинической практике, однако существенным ее недостатком является ограниченное количество гемопоэтических стволовых клеток и длительное время восстановления пациентов после трансплантации. Увеличить количество гемопоэтических стволовых и прогениторных клеток пуповинной крови можно путем экспансии ex vivo с использованием различных комбинаций цитокинов. Кроме этого, существуют методические подходы, обеспечивающие амплификацию клеток пуповинной крови ex vivo при взаимодействии с естественными для гемопоэтических клеток факторами микроокружения, в том числе со стромальным компонентом и тканевым содержанием кислорода. Развитие молекулярно-генетических методов анализа привело к расширению представлений о механизмах, опосредующих функционирование гемопоэтической ниши, что позволило разработать новые технологические приемы амплификации клеток пуповинной крови. С помощью таких подходов улучшен ряд важных клинических показателей восстановления кроветворения. Хорошие результаты получены при повышении эффективности трансплантации пуповинной крови путем создания оптимальных условий для хоминга и приживления клеток в костном мозге реципиента. В настоящем обзоре рассмотрены современные методические подходы, направленные на повышение эффективности применения гемопоэтических клеток пуповинной крови.",

    "abstract": "Одной из актуальных задач в изучении репарации ДНК остается выяснение механизма ферментативного процесса с участием эндонуклеазы APE1, который обеспечивает высокоточное узнавание апуриновых/апиримидиновых (АР) сайтов в ДНК и эффективный гидролиз 5′-фосфодиэфирной связи, играя тем самым важную роль в обеспечении стабильного функционирования ДНК и жизнедеятельности клетки. В настоящей работе проведен термодинамический анализ взаимодействия APE1 с ДНК-субстратом, содержащим аналог АР-сайта, у которого отсутствует OH-группа в положении С1′ 2′-дезоксирибозы (F-сайт). Методом «остановленного потока» с регистрацией изменений интенсивности флуоресценции белка при разных температурах проведен анализ кинетики образования фермент-субстратных комплексов, каталитической стадии и диссоциации комплекса фермента с продуктом реакции. Рассчитаны изменения стандартной свободной энергии Гиббса, энтальпии и энтропии последовательных стадий ферментативного процесса, а также образования переходного состояния в каталитической стадии. Полученные данные позволили предположить, что на первой стадии процесса происходят образование контактов между ДНК связывающим центром фермента и ДНК-субстратом, встраивание остатков Arg177 и Met270 в большую и малую бороздки ДНК соответственно и вытеснение из бороздок «кристаллической» воды. На второй стадии происходят выворачивание F-сайта в активный центр фермента и образование специфических контактов с 2′-дезоксирибозой и 5′-фосфатной группой. Показано, что основной вклад в термодинамические параметры процесса диссоциации комплекса фермент-продукт вносят неспецифические взаимодействия между ДНК-связывающим центром и рибозофосфатным остовом ДНК-дуплекса.",

    "abstract": "С целью выяснения природы вариабельности дробления проанализированы цейтраферные видеозаписи доимплантационного развития эмбрионов человека, аккумулированные в рамках стандартного протокола культивирования после процедуры внутриклеточной инъекции сперматозоида. Детально изучены топографические особенности и временные параметры дробления, определены продолжительности циклов и прослежена генеалогия бластомеров 2-8-клеточных эмбрионов человека. Обнаружено, что 4-клеточные эмбрионы распределяются в четыре группы в соответствии с ориентацией и последовательностью плоскостей второго дробления. Динамика развития эмбрионов с разными вариантами второго деления дробления существенно отличается как параметрами циклов дробления, так и продолжительностями циклов бластомеров. Анализ последовательностей делений бластомеров человека позволил предположить, что в итоге дробления элиминируются влияния зиготических детерминантов, после чего бластомеры приобретают способность к собственным синтезам и регуляциям, к поляризации и формированию функциональных контактов и, в конечном итоге, к собственным специфическим дифференциациям. Полученные с помощью неинвазивной методологии сведения о раннем развитии эмбрионов человека дополняют и расширяют представления о событиях эмбриогенеза плацентарных млекопитающих и могут найти применение в практике репродуктивных технологий.",

    "abstract": "Прекращение противооспенной вакцинации 35 лет назад привело к тому, что большинство людей в мире не имеют иммунитета не только против натуральной оспы, но и других зоонозных ортопоксвирусных инфекций. Поэтому важную задачу представляет разработка современной безопасной вакцины против ортопоксвирусов. На основе штамма LIVP вируса осповакцины (ВОВ), используемого для вакцинации, создан рекомбинантный вариант 1421ABJCN с нарушением пяти генов вирулентности, кодирующих гемагглютинин (A56R), γ-интерферонсвязывающий белок (B8R), тимидинкиназу (J2R), комплементсвязывающий белок (C3L) и Bcl-2-подобный ингибитор апоптоза (N1L). Показано, что инактивация выбранных генов вирулентности не влияет на репродуктивные свойства ВОВ на культурах клеток млекопитающих. Штамм 1421ABJCN характеризуется значительно меньшей реактогенностью и нейровирулентностью по сравнению с исходным LIVP. При интрацеребральном введении продукция вируса 1421ABJCN в головном мозге новорожденных мышей снижена на три порядка по сравнению с родительским ВОВ LIVP. Установлено, что при подкожном введении мышам рекомбинантный вариант 1421ABJCN индуцирует наработку ВОВ-нейтрализующих антител на уровне родительского штамма LIVP и обеспечивает полную защиту мышей от летальной дозы высокопатогенного для них вируса эктромелии. Рекомбинантный вариант ВОВ может быть использован в качестве безопасной живой культуральной вакцины нового поколения для профилактики натуральной оспы и других ортопоксвирусных инфекций.",

    "abstract": "This article demonstrates that Russias funding for research and development is less than 2.5 % of global funding, whereas the amount of financing of just three countries, the USA, China, and Japan amounts to 50%. It is argued that the inadequacy of Russias domestic financing for the development of the science sector vis a vis that of developed countries allows the country to prioritize only a limited number of research fields in its scientific and technological development. We have compared and contrasted expenditures on research and development in biomedicine in the USA and Russia. It has been demonstrated that in 2014, basic funding for 27 research centers included in the US National Health Institutes network exceeded the amount of financing for 104 Russian medical scientific and research institutes subordinated to the Russian Ministry of Health and Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations by 173 times. We have concluded that a substantial increase in state funding for fundamental, exploratory, and applied research in the field of biomedicine is required if life sciences are to be preserved as one of the priorities in the scientific-technological and social development of Russia. It is also necessary to eliminate all administrative and tax barriers that prevent active participation of domestic industrial entities in the co-financing of the development of Russian drugs and medical equipment.",

В представленной работе исследована способность клеток поднижнечелюстной слюнной железы мыши к дифференцировке в гепатоцитарном направлении, а также проанализировано влияние вальпроевой кислоты, ингибитора гистон-деацетилаз, на эффективность дифференцировки. Показано, что после дифференцировки в клетках слюнной железы возрастает экспрессия генов гепатоцитарных маркеров (Aat, Afp, G6p, Pepck, Tat, Cyp3a13) и факторов транскрипции (Hnf-3α, Hnf-3β, Hnf-4α, Hnf-6). Вальпроевая кислота увеличивает специфичность гепатоцитарной дифференцировки, снижая экспрессию протоковых (Krt19, Hhex1, Cyp7a1) и ацинарных (Ptf1a) маркеров. После воздействия вальпроевой кислоты усиливается также эффективность гепатоцитарной дифференцировки, о чем говорит повышение уровня Alb и Tdo2 и увеличение секреции мочевины дифференцированными клетками. Изменений в характере метилирования промоторных областей генов не обнаружено, однако обработка вальпроевой кислотой и гепатоцитарная дифференцировка в значительной степени затрагивают метилирование гистона H3, ассоциированного с генами, ключевыми для гепатоцитарной дифференцировки. Таким образом, клетки поднижнечелюстной слюнной железы мыши способны к дифференцировке в гепатоцитарном направлении, а вальпроевая кислота увеличивает специфичность и эффективность их дифференцировки.",

Клонирован ген рибокиназы термофильного микроорганизма Thermus sp. 2.9, два разных гена фосфорибозилпирофосфатсинтетазы (PRPP-cинтетазы) и ген аденин-фосфорибозилтрансферазы (APR-трансферазы) из Thermus thermophilus HB27. Получены высокопродуктивные штаммы-продуценты Escherichia coli, разработаны методы выделения упомянутых ферментов, изучена их субстратная специфичность. Показана возможность использования этих фер- ментов для превращения D-пентоз в 5-фосфаты, а затем под действием рибокиназы и PRPP-cинтетаз - в 5-фосфо-α-D-пентофуранозо-1-пирофосфаты, конденсация которых с аденином и рядом его структурных аналогов, катализируемая APR-трансферазой, приводила к получению искомых нуклеотидов. На примере 2-хлор(фтор)-аденозинмонофосфата (2Cl-AMP и 2F-AMP) показана возможность использования системы термофильных ферментов в одном реакционном объеме для получения биологически активных нуклеотидов из D-рибозы и соответствующих гетерооснований в присутствии ATP, рибокиназы, PRPP-cинтетазы и APR-трансферазы.",

    "abstract": "Рассеянный склероз (РС) - это тяжелое нейродегенеративное заболевание центральной нервной системы с полигенным типом наследования. Помимо генетических факторов, важную роль в развитии и течении РС могут играть эпигенетические механизмы, в первую очередь метилирование ДНК, влияющее на экспрессию генов. В настоящей работе для поиска дифференциально метилированных CpG-сайтов, ассоциированных с развитием двух основных клинических форм заболевания - ремиттирующего РС (РРС) и первично-прогрессирующего РС (ППРС), впервые проведен полногеномный анализ профиля метилирования ДНК в мононуклеарных клетках периферической крови больных РРС и ППРС в сравнении со здоровыми индивидами контрольной группы. Проведено также прямое сравнение профилей метилирования ДНК у пациентов с РРС и ППРС. При всех попарных сравнениях выявлены существенные различия в профилях метилирования. При иерархической кластеризации по уровню метилирования обнаруженных дифференциально метилированных сайтов (ДМС) и при визуализации данных с помощью метода главных компонент наблюдается четкое объединение образцов ДНК каждой из сравниваемых групп в отдельный кластер. У больных ППРС в сравнении со здоровыми индивидами выявлено бoльшее число ДМС, чем у больных РРС в сравнении со здоровыми индивидами (67 против 30). Более половины всех ДМС расположены в генах, что превышает число, ожидаемое при случайном распределении ДМС среди проб. В случае РРС бoльшая часть ДМС гипометилирована, при ППРС - гиперметилирована. В CpG-островках и соседних областях расположено 60% ДМС, выявляемых при сравнении РРС с контролем, и 79% - при сравнении ППРС с контролем. Прямое сравнение двух форм РС выявило 51 ДМС, из которых бoльшая часть (82%) гиперметилирована при ППРС. В целом, показано, что ППРС отличается от РРС бoльшими изменениями в паттерне метилирования ДНК. Полученные результаты свидетельствуют об участии метилирования ДНК в развитии РС. Впервые показано, что эпигенетический механизм метилирования ДНК вовлечен в формирование клинически различных форм РС - РРС и ППРС.",

Molecular fragments able to bind in the active site of this enzyme and form hydrogen bonds with the Arg168 guanidinium group, as well as additional interactions with the loop 96-111 in the closed conformation, have been identified by virtual screening of sulfonates and experimental testing of their inhibitory effect. The sulfo group can occupy a similar position as the carboxyl group of the substrate and its structural analogs, whereas the benzothiazole group attached via a linker can be located in the coenzyme (NADH) binding site. Thus, the value of merging individual structural elements of the inhibitor by a linker was demonstrated and ways of further structural modification for the design of more effective inhibitors of lactate dehydrogenase A were established.",

Первый из них - способность растительных ЛТБ связывать и переносить липиды, благодаря чему эти белки получили свое название и были объединены в один класс. Во-вторых, ЛТБ относятся к защитным белкам, являющихся факторами врожденного иммунитета растений. Кроме того, ЛТБ составляют один из наиболее клинически значимых классов растительных аллергенов.

    "abstract": "Моноциты периферической крови больных атеросклерозом предактивированы и обладают некоторыми чертами тканевых макрофагов. Их адгезия к эндотелию в 1.5 раза выше, чем у моноцитов здоровых субъектов, и они экспрессируют ряд рецепторов и антигенов, характерных для тканевых макрофагов. В дополнение к этому ранее мы показали, что в моноцитах крови больных атеросклерозом, так же как и при in vitro-дифференцировке моноцитов в макрофаги, значительно активируется биосинтез ганглиозидов, главная функция которых - формирование мембранных рафтов. В настоящей работе мы исследовали экспрессию мембранных рафтов на различных субпопуляциях моноцитов в норме и при атеросклерозе. Моноциты больных атеросклерозом, как показано методом проточной цитометрии, отличались от моноцитов здоровых субъектов двукратным увеличением процентного содержания промежуточной субпопуляции (CD14 ++ /CD16 + ) и повышением экспрессии фракталкинового рецептора CX3CR1 на промежуточной и неклассической субпопуляциях (CD14 ++ /CD16 + и CD14 + /CD16 ++ ) (в 2.3 и 1.8 раза соответственно). Это свидетельствует о предактивированном состоянии моноцитов больных. В то же время экспрессия маркера мембранных рафтов была одинаковой на субпопуляциях моноцитов обеих исследованных групп. Однако изучение in vitro дифференцировки моноцитов в макрофаги показало, что уже на первые сутки культивирования экспрессия мембранных рафтов повышалась в 2 раза и к 7-му дню возрастала в 3 раза в сравнении со свежевыделенными моноцитами. Таким образом, можно предположить, что при атеросклерозе моноциты накапливают ганглиозиды, которые используются для формирования мембранных рафтов при макрофагальной дифференцировке моноцитов после их миграции в интиму артерий.",

    "abstract": "Интеграция ДНК вируса иммунодефицита человека (ВИЧ-1) в геном зараженной клетки - одна из ключевых стадий репликативного цикла этого вируса. Катализирующий ее вирусный фермент интеграза служит важной мишенью для новых противовирусных препаратов. Однако при проведении антиретровирусной терапии в гене интегразы возникают мутации, вызывающие резистентность вируса к ингибиторам интеграции. Для оценки влияния мутаций лекарственной устойчивости на активность интегразы ВИЧ-1 субтипа А штамма FSU-A, доминирующего на территории России, получены и охарактеризованы препараты консенсусной интегразы этого субтипа вируса, содержащие первичные мутации лекарственной устойчивости G118R и Q148K и вторичные компенсаторные замены E138K и G140S, и проведено их сравнение с соответствующими мутантными формами интегразы ВИЧ-1 субтипа В штамма HXB-2. Мутация Q148K практически одинаково снижала активность интеграз обоих субтипов. Ее негативный эффект частично компенсировался вторичными мутациями E138K и G140S. Первичная замена G118R по-разному влияла на активность белков субтипов А и В, компенсаторное действие вторичной замены Е138К также зависело от субтипа вируса. Сравнение устойчивости всех мутантов к известным ингибиторам переноса цепи ралтегравиру и элвитегравиру и новому ингибитору XZ-259 из класса дигидро-1Н-изоиндолов показало, что белки обоих субтипов с мутацией Q148K малочувствительны к ралтегравиру и элвитегравиру, но достаточно эффективно ингибируются XZ-259. Замена G118R незначительно снижала эффективность ингибирования интеграз ралтегравиром и элвитегравиром и не вызывала устойчивости к XZ-259.",

    "abstract": "Белки оболочки вируса гепатита С (ВГС) E1 и E2, являясь компонентами вириона, участвуют в формировании инфекционных частиц вируса в зараженной клетке. Детальное строение частицы ВГС остается малоизученным, причем наименее изучен процесс сборки вирионов и их выход из клетки. Предполагается, что свойства вириона зависят от гликозилирования белковой оболочки вируса в клетке, а гликаны в некоторых сайтах гликозилирования этих белков важны для их функционирования и прохождения жизненного цикла ВГС. N-гликаны гликопротеинов могут влиять на формирование вирусных частиц, связывание вируса с клеткой и патогенез гепатита С. Мы изучили влияние гликанов на сворачивание гликопротеина Е2, образование функциональных гликопротеиновых комплексов и формирование вирусных частиц в клетках насекомых и млекопитающих. С этой целью в сайты N-гликозилирования Е2 вируса гепатита С (генотип 1б штамм 274933RU) вводили точечные мутации и анализировали мутантные белки в бакуловирусной системе экспрессии. Удаление единичных сайтов гликозилирования гликопротеина Е2, за исключением сайта N6, не сказывалось на эффективности его синтеза в клетках насекомых Sf9, а электрофоретическая подвижность мутантных белков возрастала пропорционально снижению числа сайтов гликозилирования. В отличие от клеток Sf9, уровень синтеза гликопротеина Е2 ВГС в клетках Hek293T человека зависел от присутствия гликанов в сайтах гликозилирования N1 и N8. В то же время удаление гликанов в сайтах N1, N2 и N10 приводило к накоплению непродуктивных димеров Е1Е2 в виде агрегатов и подавлению продуктивной сборки вирусоподобных частиц как в клетках насекомых, так и в клетках млекопитающих. Удаление единичных сайтов гликозилирования Е2 ВГС не влияло на синтез РНК структурных белков и образование вирусоподобных частиц в клетках насекомых и млекопитающих.",

Использование флуоресцентных агентов высокой яркости красного и дальне-красного диапазона дает возможность проводить неинвазивные исследования выведения и распределения белковых препаратов в живом организме.

Установлено, что максимум разгорания флуоресценции, отражающей деградацию фермента, наблюдается через 6 ч после внутривенного введения препарата. Показано, что избыточная конъюгация флуорофора приводит к существенному изменению фармакокинетических параметров препарата.

Высказано предположение, что в моторных нервных терминалях мыши холин способен активировать пресинаптические α7-никотиновые холинорецепторы с последующим выбросом депонированного кальция через рианодиновые рецепторы и активацией кальций-зависимых калиевых каналов SK-типа, что приводит к устойчивому снижению квантового состава вызванного выброса медиатора.",

    "abstract": "В обзоре рассмотрены функциональная роль и регуляция экспрессии различных изоформ белка-коактиватора PGC-1α, одного из ключевых регуляторов биогенеза митохондрий в скелетной мышце. Паттерн экспрессии мРНК PGC-1α может значительно изменяться в покое и после мышечной активности. Это связано с тем, что экспрессия гена PGC-1α с канонического и альтернативного промоторов регулируется различными физиологическими стимулами, которые воздействуют на разные сигнальные пути. Экспрессия с канонического (проксимального) промотора регулируется главным образом через AMP-активируемую протеинкиназу, а с альтернативного - через β2-адренорецепторы. Транскрибируемые с обоих промоторов мРНК подвергаются альтернативному сплайсингу с образованием укороченных изоформ PGC-1α, которые обладают значительно большей устойчивостью к деградации и регулируют преимущественно ангиогенез, тогда как полноразмерные изоформы - биогенез митохондрий. Существование нескольких изоформ частично объясняет широкий спектр функций этого белка и повышает способность организма адаптироваться к различным физиологическим стимулам. Регуляция экспрессии гена PGC-1α с помощью различных сигнальных путей позволяет рассчитывать на разработку фармакологических способов воздействия на экспрессию этого гена. Это может иметь важное значение для лечения и профилактики различных заболеваний, таких, как метаболический синдром и сахарный диабет. Изучение механизмов, регулирующих экспрессию гена PGC-1α, и их функциональной роли может позволить управлять экспрессией этого гена с помощью физических нагрузок и/или фармакологических воздействий.",

В основу разработанных биотехнологических подходов легли более ранние фундаментальные исследования анаэробного стресса растений, поэтому во «Введении» кратко отмечена актуальность самой проблемы, подчеркнуто значение работ, в которых рассмотрены две главные стратегии адаптации растений к анаэробному стрессу - адаптации на молекулярном уровне, в которой ключевую роль играет анаэробный энергетический метаболизм (истинная толерантность), и адаптации на уровне целого организма растений путем формирования аэренхимы и облегченного транспорта кислорода (кажущаяся толерантность). Так, путем ступенчатой клеточной селекции in vitro, проведенной в условиях аноксии в отсутствие экзогенных углеводов, были выделены толерантные к анаэробному стрессу клетки сахарного тростника и пшеницы. Из толерантных клеток пшеницы были регенерированы целые растения, более устойчивые к корневому анаэробиозу. Показано, что в толерантности клеток к аноксии существенную роль играет способность более активно утилизировать экзогенный нитрат. Толерантность клеток закреплялась на генном уровне и передавалась в ряду поколений. Рассмотрены также другие успешные попытки повысить толерантность растений к анаэробному стрессу путем сверхэкспрессии генов, ответственных за синтез цитокинина и за программированную клеточную смерть, а также благодаря стимуляции гликолиза. Представленные данные подтвердили концепцию о двух главных стратегиях адаптации растений к анаэробному стрессу, выдвинутую ранее на основе фундаментальных исследований.",

    "abstract": "Predisposition to multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, is due to various factors. The genetic component is considered one of the most important factors. HLA class II genes contribute the most to the development of MS. The HLA-DRB1*15 allele group is considered one of the main genetic risk factors predisposing to MS. The group of HLA-DRB1*01 alleles was shown to have a protective effect against this disease in the Russian population. In this work, we compared the binding of the encephalitogenic fragment of the myelin basic protein (MBP) to two HLA-DR complexes that provide protection against and predisposition to MS: HLA-DR1 (HLA-DRB1*0101) and HLA-DR15 (HLA-DRB1*1501), respectively. We found that the myelin peptide MBP88-100 binds to HLA-DR1 at a rate almost an order of magnitude lower than the viral peptide of hemagglutinin (HA). The same was true for the binding of MBP85-97 to HLA-DR15 in comparison with viral pp65. The structure of the C-terminal part of the peptide plays a key role in the binding to HLA-DR1 for equally high-affinity N-terminal regions of the peptides. The IC50 of the myelin peptide MBP88-100 competing with viral HA for binding to HLA-DR1 is almost an order of magnitude higher than that of HA. As for HA, the same was also true for the binding of MBP85-97 to HLA-DR15 in comparison with viral pp65. Thus, autoantigenic MBP cannot compete with the viral peptide for binding to protective HLA-DR1. However, it is more competitive than viral peptide for HLA-DR15.",

There are two main approaches used to increase the efficiency of photosensitizers. The first one is targeted delivery to the object of photodynamic action, while the second one is increasing the absorption capacity of the molecule. Both approaches can be implemented by producing dye-nanoparticle conjugates. In this review, we focus on the features of the latter approach, when nanoparticles act as a light-harvesting agent and nonradiatively transfer the electronic excitation energy to a photosensitizer molecule. We will consider the hybrid photosensitizer-quantum dot complexes with energy transfer occurring according to the inductive-resonance mechanism as an example. The principle consisting in optimizing the design of hybrid complexes is proposed after an analysis of the published data; the parameters affecting the efficiency of energy transfer and the generation of reactive oxygen species in such systems are described.",

Известно, что киназный комплекс mTORC1 активируется факторами роста и аминокислотами через активацию GTP-азы Rheb. В представ-ленной работе впервые показано, что сверхэкспрессия в культуре клеток эмбриональной почки человека белка Rabin8 (далее – рабин-8), функционирующего в качестве фактора обмена гуаниновых нуклеотидов для GTP-азы Rab8, приводит к снижению фосфорилирования Ser235/Ser236 в рибосомном белке S6. На-против, снижение экспрессии белка рабин-8 с помощью малых интерферирующих РНК (siРНК, small interfering RNA) приводит к повышению уровня фосфорилирования Ser235/Ser236 в белке S6. Показано также, что рабин-8 связывается с GTP-азой Rheb. Полученные результаты могут свидетельствовать о су-ществовании ранее неизвестного механизма модуляции функциональной активности киназного комплек-са mTORС1 и о регуляции управляемых им процессов, в первую очередь биосинтеза белков. Принимая во внимание роль рабина-8 как одного из важных регуляторов процесса образования клеточной реснички (цилиогенеза), можно предположить существование связи между этими процессами и образованием пер-вичной реснички.

Стратегия поиска новых эффективных и безопасных соединений, направленная на создание латентных форм (депо-форм) на основе AZT, принесла первые положительные результаты. Так, натриевая соль 5'-H-фосфоната AZT (Никавир, фосфазид) показала клинические преимущества перед AZT, прежде всего значительно меньшую токсичность и лучшую переносимость. Никавир может эффективно использоваться для профилактики передачи ВИЧ от матери ребенку, а также в качестве альтернативного препарата при непереносимости Зидовудина. Доклинические испытания еще одного фосфоната, 5'-аминокарбонилфосфоната AZT, показали, что при его приеме происходит высвобождение AZT, причем фармакокинетические параметры AZT указывают на пролонгированность фармакологического действия.

    "abstract": "Укорачивание концов хромосом (теломер), обусловленное полуконсервативным механизмом репликации ДНК, определяет возможное число делений клетки, играя роль «клеточных часов». Теломераза удлиняет одну из цепей теломеры, компенсируя ее укорачивание, поэтому теломеразная активность служит маркером пролиферативной активности клеток. В подавляющем большинстве нормальных клеток человека теломераза неактивна, в отличие от эмбриональных тканей, стволовых клеток и репродуктивных органов. Теломераза активируется в большинстве злокачественных опухолей, что можно использовать для диагностики неопластической трансформации. Поэтому разработка методов определения теломеразной активности привлекает внимание исследователей. Тестирование теломеразной активности необходимо при поиске ингибиторов теломеразы потенциальных противоопухолевых средств. Кроме того, активация теломеразы может играть положительную роль при регенерации тканей, к примеру, после частичного удаления печени или инфаркта миокарда. Все методы определения активности теломеразы можно разделить на две большие группы: методы, основанные на прямом определении синтезированной теломеразой ДНК, и методы, использующие различные схемы усиления сигнала от ДНК, созданной теломеразой. Рассмотренные в представленном обзоре методы пригодны для тестирования теломеразной активности в клетках простейших, отдельных клетках клеточных линий, смешанных клеточных популяциях и тканях.",

The prospects of using the reproductive \"success\" of the carriers of these characteristics as an integral indicator of the selective influence of environmental stress factors are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Изучение экспрессии генов с помощью массированного секвенирования в настоящее время находит широкое применение в различных областях биологии, включая микробиологию. В данной работе приведены результаты анализа полногеномной экспрессии Mycobacterium tuberculosis при персистировании в тканях легкого инфицированного хозяина. Мышей двух линий с генетически различной чувствительностью к туберкулезу инфицировали патогенными бактериями M. tuberculosis. Библиотеки кДНК микобактерий, полученные из инфицированных тканей, были подвергнуты массированному секвенированию и сравнительному анализу. Установлено, что структура транскриптома M. tuberculosis при развитии инфекции указывает на активизацию липидного метаболизма, метаболизма аминокислот, переход к анаэробному дыханию, повышение экспрессии факторов модуляции иммунного ответа. Важный результат нашей работы – выделение 209 генов, уровень экспрессии которых повышался в ходе развития инфекционного процесса в организмах хозяев обеих линий – Commonly Upregulated Genes (CUG). Наибольший интерес представляют гены, относящиеся к функциональным категориям липидного метаболизма и клеточной стенки и клеточных процессов. Мы полагаем, что продукты этих генов необходимы M. tuberculosis для преодоления иммунного ответа организма хозяина и тем самым представляют потенциальные мишени для разработки лекарственных средств.",

    "abstract": "В женских соматических клетках млекопитающих работает эпигенетический механизм дозовой компенсации, включающий инактивацию одной из двух Х-хромосом через формирование факультативного гетерохроматина. В отличие от плюрипотентных стволовых клеток (ПСК) мыши, статус Х-хромосомы в плюрипотентных клетках человека является эпигенетически пластичным признаком. Известно, что для гетерохроматина свойственна поздняя репликация в поздней S-фазе клеточного цикла после репликации эухроматина. Это характерно и для факультативного гетерохроматина инактивированной Х-хромосомы. Принято считать, что неактивная Х-хромосома в клетках млекопитающих всегда имеет большую конденсацию в интерфазном ядре. Предполагается, что именно плотная упаковка определяет позднюю репликацию инактивированной Х-хромосомы. Методом полнохромосомной ДНК-гибридизации на интерфазных ядрах мы показали, что ПСК человека с инактивированной Х-хромосомой могут иметь как релаксированную, так и компактную хромосомную территорию неактивной Х-хромосомы. Поздняя репликация инактивированной Х-хромосомы также не зависит от степени компактизации ее хромосомной территории. Тем не менее для перехода Х-хромосомы к активному состоянию при ее реактивации и для синхронной репликации необходимым условием является декомпактизация хромосомной территории Х-хромосомы.",

Ранее в нашей лаборатории был клонирован ген AEH из Xanthomonas rubrilineans (XrAEH). В представленной работе с целью рационального дизайна XrAEH методом гомологичного моделирования построена структура этого фермента и проведен анализ его активного центра. Идентифицированы остатки, образующие каталитическую триаду (Ser175, His341 и Asp308), а также остатки, входящие в оксианионный центр (Tyr83 и Tyr176) и карбоксилатный кластер (карбоксильные группы остатков Asp311, Asp209 и Glu310). Показано, что оптимальная конформация остатков каталитической триады реализуется при суммарном заряде карбоксилатного кластера, равного –1. С помощью докинга получены структуры комплексов XrAEH с ампициллином, амоксициллином, цефалексином, метиловыми эфирами D-фенилглицина и 4-окси-D-фенилглицина. С помощью моделирования комплексов фермента с различными субстратами проведен анализ полученных структур и определен ряд антибиотиков, при синтезе которых фермент XrAEH будет наиболее эффективен.",

Наблюдали значимую позитивную ассоциацию частот носительства аллеля TGFB1*-509T (p = 0.046, ОШ = 1.45, 95% ДИ: 1.02-2.06) и генотипов TGFB1*869T/T (p = 0.0024, ОШ = 1.75, 95% ДИ: 1.22-2.51) и TGFB1*915G/G (p = 0.048, ОШ = 1.76, 95% ДИ: 1.05-2.97) с ИМ. Анализ неравновесия по сцеплению между этими SNP показал, что выявленные ассоциации можно рассматривать как не зависящие друг от друга. Комплексный анализ ассоциации ИМ с носительством сочетаний аллелей/генотипов указанных SNP свидетельствует о кумулятивных эффектах этих SNP. При анализе предрасположенности к раннему ИМ (l 50 лет) обнаружена позитивная ассоциация аллеля TGFB1*-509T (p = 0.002, ОШ = 2.24, 95% ДИ: 1.35-3.71) и генотипа TGFB1*869T/T (p = 0.008, ОШ = 1.93, 95% ДИ: 1.18-3.15), а также аддитивность их вкладов. Анализ предрасположенности к повторным ИМ выявил ассоциацию генотипа TGFB1*-509T/T (p = 0.0078, ОШ = 2.60, 95% ДИ: 1.28-5.28).

Уже проходят клинические испытания (фазы II и III) клеточных продуктов, предназначенных для восстановления таких тканей, как кожа, роговица, гортань и др. Однако получение дифференцированных клеток, характерных для большинства органов, представляет собой более сложную задачу. Предметом лабораторных исследований остается получение функционирующих нейронов, кардиомиоцитов, клеток печени, поджелудочной железы и т.д. Применение клеточной терапии при патологиях печени - сложный многостадийный процесс, требующий детального понимания особенностей дифференцировки и регенерации гепатоцитов. В представленном обзоре проанализировано современное состояние клеточной терапии патологий печени, описано использование различных типов клеток, рассмотрены основные молекулярно-генетические механизмы дифференцировки гепатоцитов, а также проблемы и перспективы развития данного метода.",

Before that, using a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) coupled with reverse transcription, it was shown that, in this very lineage of the embryonic SC, the expression of the receptors’ genes is being fulfilled for the neurotropfic RET and GFRα1 glia factor. The mouse's embryonic SC lineage has been obtained, transfected by the human GDNF gene, and has been fused with the “green” fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The presence of the expression of the human GDNF gene in the cells was shown by northern hybridization and the synthesis of its albuminous product by immunocitochemical coloration with the use of specific antibodies. The reliable slowing-down of the embriod-body formation by the embryonic SC transfected by the GDNF gene has been shown. No significant influence of the expression of the GDNF gene on the morphology and the proliferative activity of the transfected embryonic SCs has been found when compared with the control ones.",

This reorganization consists of the relocation to the nuclear matrix of the whole genomic domain containing one or more of the genes being transcribed. However, it remains unclear whether, during this process, extended areas of the genome also become attached to the nuclear matrix. We studied the genome´s pattern of interaction with the nuclear matrix in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells of chickens, using a 220Kb region of chromosome #14, which contains the alpha-globin gene cluster and some surrounding house-keeping genes. The results show that in erythroid cells, the fragment of the genome containing the alpha-globin gene domain became spatially arranged into micro-loops which could not be detected by mapping experiments.",

Методом ДРС с использованием анализатора Malvern Zetasizer предложено измерять дзета-потенциал клеточных линий и клеток крови в суспензии. При рН 7.4 дзета-потенциал варьирует от -19.4 ± 0.8 мВ у клеток HeLa до -31.8 ± 1.1 мВ у эритроцитов, что, по-видимому, обусловлено различиями в биохимическом составе мембран этих клеток. Тепловая обработка клеток HeLa приводила к смещению их дзета-потенциала в область отрицательных значений на 4.2 мВ. Изменение дзета-потенциала коррелировало с увеличением содержания фосфатидилсерина, одного из ранних маркеров апоптоза, на поверхности клеток. Метод ДРС применили для изучения особенностей взаимодействия с клетками мембранотропных полимеров - поликатионов и неионогенного плуроника.",

Показано, что наночастицы малого размера (~ 2 нм) индуцируют два разных процесса: (1) переход холестерической структуры частицы дисперсии в нематическую, сопровождаемый быстрым уменьшением амплитуды аномальной полосы в спектре кругового дихроизма, и (2) формирование кластеров из наночастиц золота в «свободном пространстве» между соседними молекулами ДНК, фиксированными в структуре квазинематических слоев частиц дисперсии, сопровождаемое медленным развитием полосы поверхностного плазмонного резонанса. Изучено действие разных факторов на эти процессы. Высказаны предположения о возможных механизмах фиксации наночастиц золота между соседними молекулами нуклеиновых кислот в квазинематических слоях.",

However, the mechanisms of this interference remain poorly understood. We studied the conformation of angiotensins 1, 2 and 3, which are produced naturally in a sequential fashion from a precursor protein angiotensinogen and contain an identical peptide core structure. Using the example of angiotensins 1, 2 and 3, it was shown that similar amino acid sequences may have significant conformational differences in various molecules. In order to assess the conformational changes, we developed a panel of high-affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies against angiotensins 1, 2 and 3 and studied their cross-reactivity in indirect and competitive ELISAs. It was found that the conformations of inactive angiotensin1 and the corresponding fragment of angiotensinogen are similar; the same is true for the conformations of active angiotensins 2 and 3, whereas the conformations of homologous fragments in the active and inactive angiotensins differ significantly.",

If we consider the sad end to that quatrain (about “life that sends all of those researchers far, far away”) as an illustration of the process of putting new knowledge to practice, we must admit that the current situation is even worse. In fact, until the collapse of the USSR (in the end of the 1980s), the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries provided most of the drugs the nation required. Biopharmacy in the USSR functioned the way modern corporations do. Each branch had specialized Research Institutes in which production-orientated R-D was conducted. There were also communal usage centers that worked on certain scientific tasks of the Soviet biopharmaceuticals industry. Centralized R-D and innovations made the Soviet Union one of the world’s leaders in certain fields.",

    "abstract": "Cell regulation of Ph +cell proliferation and differentiation has been studied ex vivo in various chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. The regulation is provided by alternation of effective stages of proliferation and maturation with inhibition of Ph+ cell proliferation by accumulating neutrophils under apoptosis blockage. The alternation of stages consists of switching stage 1 (effective proliferation) to stage 2 (effective maturation) and proceeds according to the 1/2 -1/2/1 or 2/1-2/1/2/1 schemes. The kinetic plots of alternations pass through control points of crossing plots, where the parameters of proliferation and maturation are equal. The indices of P/D efficiency (ratio of proliferation and maturation rates) are 1.06±0.23 and don’t depend on time, alternation order, or sources of Ph+ cells – CML patients. During stages alternation, conversely, the parameters of Ph + cell proliferation and maturation vary. The proliferation stages are characterized by increased proliferating cells content, a decreased number of neutrophils, and apoptosis induction. At the maturation stages, conversely, apoptosis is inhibited, the number of mature neutrophils increases, while immature Ph + cells decrease. High content neutrophils inhibit the proliferation of Ph + cells and impair their own maturation by inversion of maturation order, probably through a feedback mechanism. The regulation differences ex vivo reveal three types of Ph + cells from various individual CML patients, distinguished by the number and duration of alternating stages of proliferation and maturation. Ph + cells types 1 and 2 have one prolonged stage of effective proliferation or effective maturation with efficiency indices P/D 1 = 1-20 or P/D 2 ≤ 1. At the same time period, the proliferation and differentiation of the Ph + cells type 3 proceeds with repeated alternations of stages with P/D 1 = 1-4 or P/D 2 ≤ 1. Type 1 Ph + cells (~20%) were isolated from patients in advanced stages of CML, while Ph + cells types 2 and 3 (30 and 50% correspondingly) were isolated from CML chronic phase patients sensitive to chemotherapy.",

However, the term domestically produced drug still remains to be legislatively defined. According to the draft resolution issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in May 2012, a domestic drug should mean a drug whose production cycle in the territory of the Russian Federation starts from a substance or a ready-toconsume formulation. Until 2014, the Ministry was ready to regard even those drugs whose packaging was made in Russia as Russian ones. However, no further steps followed. Therefore, the question pertaining to which drugs and which produced by which pharmaceutical companies should be regarded as domestic drugs remains open.

Direct condensation of the acid and the amine took place at mild reaction conditions with a high initial rate (3.3 μmole/(l∙h)), degree of conversion (80% acylation of active amine enantiomer), and enantioselectivity (enantiomeric excess of the product was more than 95%).

If we consider the sad end to that quatrain (about “life that sends all of those researchers far, far away”) as an illustration of the process of putting new knowledge to practice, we must admit that the current situation is even worse. In fact, until the collapse of the USSR (in the end of the 1980s), the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries provided most of the drugs the nation required. Biopharmacy in the USSR functioned the way modern corporations do. Each branch had specialized Research Institutes in which production-orientated R-D was conducted. There were also communal usage centers that worked on certain scientific tasks of the Soviet biopharmaceuticals industry. Centralized R-D and innovations made the Soviet Union one of the world’s leaders in certain fields.",

In this study, we looked at the changes in the pool of liver proteasomes during nodular regenerative hyperplasia and formation of adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice treated with Dipin, followed by partial liver resection. The relative content of various proteasome forms was determined using Western blot analysis. The chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasomes was assessed from the hydrolysis of the commercial Suc-LLVY-AMC substrate. It was found that changes in the proteasome pool appeared already during the formation of diffuse nodules, the changes being the increased expression of the X(β5) constitutive subunit and the LMP7(β5i) and LMP2(β1i) immune subunits, accompanied by the increase of the total proteasome pool and the decrease in the chymotrypsin-like activity. These changes were more pronounced in hepatocellular carcinoma. The content of the total proteasome pool and the LMP2(β1i) immune subunit and the chymotrypsin-like activity in adenoma were intermediate compared to those in the samples of liver with diffuse nodules and carcinoma. In addition, the level of the Rpt6 subunit present in the 19S proteasome activator was increased in carcinoma. Our results indicate that nodular regenerative hyperplasia and adenomatosis may be stages preceding carcinogenesis. We also conclude that there is a need to find signalling pathways that change the expression of various proteasome subunits during carcinogenesis. The l9S proteasome activator, which is overexpressed in malignant tumours, can be a promising target for the development of new anticancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "The share of locally produced insulin on the Russian market estimated at more than seven billion roubles in 2008 is, in reality, microscopic: national industry covers only 2 % of the market (see Table 1). This is unreasonably small, especially because а) Russian producers have enough capacity to produce insulin for the entire country, with similar or even higher quality as compared with foreign products, b) hundreds of thousands of insulindependent patients in some particular political or economical circumstances could suffer without this life-saving treatment. The World Health Organization recommends that any country with a population of more than 50 millions have its own manufacturing base for insulin. Anatoly Miroshnikov is an assistant director of the M.M. Shemiakin and Y.A. Ovchinnikov’ Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the RAS, which produces insulin with the trade name Insuran. He talks to Acta Naturae on why Russia needs its own factories for the production of genetically engineered drugs.",

    "abstract": "Государственный научный центр Российской Федерации – Институт медико-биологических проблем РАН, 123007, Москва, Хорошевское ш., 76А*E-mail: sveta@ermolaeva.msk.suПоступила в редакцию 10.05.2012 г.РЕФЕРАТ Низкотемпературная плазма (НТП) – это поток частично ионизированного газа, имеющего тем-пературу, близкую к температуре окружающей среды. НТП включает большое количество биологически активных частиц (ионы, электроны, свободные радикалы, частицы в метастабильных состояниях), что по-зволяет использовать НТП для решения различных биомедицинских задач, в том числе в терапии ново-образований. Обработка опухолевых клеток НТП вызывает дозозависимые эффекты, такие, как арест клеточного цикла и вступление клеток в апоптоз, однако точные молекулярные механизмы воздействия НТП на эукариотические клетки не изучены. В представленной работе мы изучили механизм развития и тип гибели клеток карциномы кишечника HCT116 человека, обработанных низкотемпературной аргоно-вой плазмой, и определили влияние НТП на основной активируемый стрессом фактор транскрипции р53. Показано, что выживаемость клеток HCT116 после обработки НТП зависит от наличия функционального белка р53. Воздействие НТП приводит к увеличению внутриклеточной концентрации р53 и индукции экспрессии контролируемых им генов, в частности активации основной проапоптотической каспазы-3. Впервые показано, что обработка клеток карциномы кишечника низкотемпературной плазмой приводит к р53-зависимому апоптозу. Эти результаты важны для понимания возможностей использования НТП в медицине в качестве противоопухолевого средства. КЛЮЧЕВЫЕ СЛОВА низкотемпературная плазма, белок p53, апоптоз.СПИСОК СОКРАЩЕНИЙ НТП – низкотемпературная плазма; СВЧ – сверхвысокочастотный.ВВЕДЕНИЕ Низкотемпературная плазма (НТП) представляет собой частично ионизированный газ, полученный при атмосферном давлении и имеющий макроскопи-ческую температуру, близкую к температуре окру-жающей среды [1]. Интенсивное изучение возмож-ностей применения НТП в медицине началось около 10 лет назад, хотя первые работы появились намного раньше, преимущественно в России [2–4]. В состав факела НТП входят заряженные части-цы, нейтральные активные частицы, в том числе свободные радикалы и частицы в метастабильных состояниях, а также ультрафиолетовое излучение. Биологические эффекты НТП связаны с синергич-ным действием перечисленных факторов, подпорого-вая концентрация каждого из которых в большинстве случаев не вызывает изменений в биологическом объекте [5, 6].В настоящее время активно изучают возможность использования НТП в качестве антибактериального агента, так как установлено, что НТП обладает не-специфической бактерицидной активностью, позво-ляющей применять НТП для стерилизации термо-чувствительных поверхностей и для санирования тканей, в том числе раневых поверхностей [7–9]. Дру-гая потенциальная область применения НТП – тера-пия новообразований. Так, сообщается о селективно-сти цитотоксического действия плазмы в отношении разных типов клеток человека, а также о возможно-сти подбора условий, обеспечивающих избиратель-",

Vladimir Alexandrovich won broad fame and international acclaim as far back as the 1930s for discovering oxidative (respiratory) phosphorylation with the participation of ATP. In the beginning of the 1940s, Vladimir Alexandrovich earned fame again, when he and his wife Milicia Nikolaevna Lyubimova discovered the fermentation activity of myosin protein, which allowed him to suggest a theory about the combination of the structure and functions of biological compounds on the level of individual molecules. This scientific body of work became part of a goldmine of science, while Vladimir Alexandrovich began to be justifiably referred to as one of the founders of molecular biology in our country.",

Нами изучено действие соединения ГК-2 (гексаметилендиамид-бис-(N-моносукцинил-глутамил-лизина)), оригинального димерного аналога NGF, на мышей C57Bl/6 со стрептозотоциновым диабетом типа 2. ГК-2, сконструированный ранее в НИИ фармакологии на основе структуры β-изгиба 4-й петли NGF, обладает способностью имитировать эффекты нативного NGF, в том числе нейропротективный. Показано, что ГК-2 как при внутрибрюшинном (в дозе 0.5 мг/кг), так и пероральном (в дозе 5 мг/кг) введении устраняет гипергликемию, вызванную стрептозотоцином (100 мг/кг), восстанавливает число (%) животных, обучившихся в водном лабиринте Морриса, и ослабляет выраженность депрессивноодобного состояния. Перспективность фармакологической разработки ГК-2 обусловлена сочетанием его антидиабетического эффекта с положительным воздействием на когнитивные функции и антидепрессивные свойства, а также сохранением активности при пероральном введении. ГК-2, как показано ранее, селективно активирует один из двух основных сигнальных путей, путь PI3K/Аkt, поэтому можно предположить, что Аkt-сигнализации достаточно для поддержания функционирования β-клеток. Наличие у ГК-2 как нейропротективной, так и антидиабетической активности согласуется с фундаментальной концепцией общности механизмов регуляции функций нейронов и β-клеток поджелудочной железы.",

    "abstract": "РНК-связывающие белки (RBP) регулируют метаболизм РНК на всех его этапах - от биосинтеза до деградации. Взаимодействуя с РНК, RBP участвуют также в поддержании стабильности генома на различных уровнях - от предотвращения повреждений в ДНК до посттранскрипционной координации экспрессии генов. Недавно было показано непосредственное участие RBP в репарации (исправлении повреждений) ДНК, что представляет особый интерес, поскольку в большинстве случаев этот процесс происходит без участия РНК. У высших организмов вблизи повреждения ДНК синтезируется РНК-подобный ядерный полимер - поли(АDP-рибоза) (PAR). Сходство с нуклеиновой кислотой позволяет PAR привлекать к месту повреждения ДНК- и РНК-связывающие белки. Предполагается, что поли(АDP-рибоза) и RBP способны не только модулировать активность ферментов репарации ДНК, но и играть важную структурную роль в создании временного «репарационного компартмента» в клетке. Сходный процесс «фильтрации» молекул происходит в цитоплазме при образовании ансамблей функционально связанных РНК и мультиспецифичных RBP. Главный компонент цитоплазматических РНК-ансамблей - Y-бокс-связывающий белок 1 (YB-1) - является классическим РНК-связывающим белком, который рассматривается как неканонический фактор репарации ДНК.",

С тех пор было зафиксировано более 20 вспышек, самая крупная из которых в 2014-2016 годах переросла в эпидемию на территории Западной Африки и унесла жизни более 11000 человек. Хотя наиболее эффективным средством борьбы с эпидемиями является вакцинопрофилактика, к началу эпидемии БВВЭ в мире не было ни одной зарегистрированной и разрешенной к применению вакцины. Разработка первых вакцин против БВВЭ началась еще в 1980 году и прошла огромный технологический путь от инактивированных до генноинженерных вакцин на основе рекомбинантных вирусных векторов. Данный обзор посвящен векторным вакцинам против БВВЭ, которые показали наибольшую эффективность в доклинических исследованиях и в настоящее время находятся на разных этапах клинических исследований. Особое внимание уделено механизмам развития иммунного ответа, важным для защиты организма от БВВЭ, а также ключевым параметрам вакцин, необходимых для индукции длительного протективного иммунитета против БВВЭ.",

С целью изучения механизмов трансляционной активации вирусной РНК потексвирусов нами исследованы трансляционные свойства двух других представителей этого рода - вируса мозаики нарцисса и вируса аукубы-мозаики картофеля. Показано, что в составе вирионов РНК потексвирусов обладает общими трансляционными свойствами in vitro, и ТБ1 способны трансляционно активировать РНК не только своего, гомологичного, вириона, но и РНК в составе вирионов других представителей группы (кросс-активация), проявляя при этом избирательную специфичность. Взаимная трансляционная кросс-активация происходит у вирусов, принадлежащих к одной или к близким филогенетическим подгруппам. Получены прямые доказательства того, что связывание ТБ1 с торцом вириона является обязательным, но недостаточным условием для трансляционной активации инкапсидированной РНК.",

При помощи биоинформатического и мутационного анализа регуляторных элементов, перекрывающихся с полиморфными позициями, мы провели поиск функциональных регуляторных полиморфизмов локуса SLAMF1, ассоциированных с аутоиммунными процессами. Анализ активности гена-репортера в B-клеточных линиях МР-1 и Raji показал, что введение минорного варианта полиморфизма rs3753381 (G > A), ассоциированного с миастенией гравис, более чем вдвое увеличивает энхансерную активность регуляторного участка локуса, содержащего rs3753381. При анализе нуклеотидного контекста в окрестности rs3753381 установлено, что минорный вариант этого полиморфизма улучшает сайты связывания факторов транскрипции семейств FOX и NFAT и ядерных рецепторов семейства RXR. Внесение мутаций, нарушающих какие-либо из этих сайтов, приводит к снижению энхансерной активности как в клетках МР-1, так и в Raji, причем каждая из двух использованных В-клеточных линий экспрессирует специфический набор таких факторов. Таким образом, минорный вариант полиморфизма rs3753381 может быть ассоциирован с миастенией гравис за счет модуляции экспрессии SLAMF1, предположительно, в В-лимфоцитах, участвующих в патологических аутоиммунных реакциях.",

В представленном обзоре проведен анализ нарушений метаболизма холестерина при широко распространенных нейродегенеративных заболеваниях (болезнях Альцгеймера, Паркинсона) и расстройствах аутистического спектра. Особое внимание уделено дефектам синаптической передачи, возникновение которых может быть связано с изменением содержания холестерина в нейрональных мембранах и продукцией оксистеролов. Примечательно, что альтерации обмена мозгового холестерина, как и нейропередачи, происходят на очень ранних стадиях данных патологий, и полиморфизм генов, ассоциированных с метаболизмом холестерина или синаптической передачей, влияет на риск их развития и тяжесть. В модельных системах фармакологические и/или генетические вмешательства в гомеостаз мозгового холестерина зачастую имеют выраженные эффекты на протекание нейродегенеративных заболеваний. Таким образом, развитие болезней Альцгеймера, Паркинсона и расстройств аутистического спектра частично может быть связано с дисбалансом обмена холестерина в мозге, ведущего к изменениям содержания мембранного холестерина и оксистеролов, что, в свою очередь, влияет на ключевые этапы синаптической передачи.",

При потенциалах фиксации ниже -40 мВ наблюдается неаддитивность эффектов агонистов: суммарный ток, регистрируемый при совместной аппликации агонистов, существенно превышает сумму токов, возникающих при аппликации каждого из агонистов в отдельности. Такая потенциал-зависимая потенциация токов через TRPV1-каналы, по всей видимости, лежит в основе сенсибилизации TRPV1-рецепторов при воспалении и боли, когда растут концентрации провоспалительных медиаторов,являющихся агонистами данных рецепторов. Однако деполяризация мембраны, возникающая при активации TRPV1-рецепторов, ограничивает их последующий ответ, что может служить защитным механизмом, ограничивающим их активацию.",

К этому событию мировое сообщество шло почти 20 лет после принятия Всемирной организацией здравоохранения программы глобальной ликвидации этого особо опасного инфекционного заболевания. Вакцинация против оспы была отменена, и за прошедшие 40 лет человечество в своем большинстве утратило иммунитет не только к оспе, но и другим зоонозным ортопоксвирусным инфекциям. Это, в частности, привело к тому, что в последние годы на разных континентах все чаще стали регистрироваться вспышки ортопоксвирусных инфекций среди людей. Существует угроза возврата оспы в результате эволюционных преобразований зоонозных ортопоксвирусов. Для предотвращения распространения таких инфекций разрабатываются современные методы диагностики, профилактики и терапии оспы и ортопоксвирусных инфекций.",

Ранее нами были получены поливалентная ДНК-вакцина на основе пяти антигенов VARV и аттенуированный вариант вируса осповакцины (vaccinia virus, VACV) с направленной делецией шести генов (VAC∆6). В независимых опытах показано, что трехкратная иммунизация ДНК-вакциной и двукратная иммунизация VAC∆6 обеспечивали защиту мышей от летальной дозы (10 LD50) высокопатогенного для них вируса эктромелии (ectromelia virus, ECTV). Цель представленной работы состояла в сравнении противооспенного иммунитета, формируемого при различных схемах иммунизации ДНК-вакциной и VAC∆6. Установлено, что иммунизация мышей поливалентной ДНК-вакциной с последующим бустированием рекомбинантным вариантом VAC∆6 наравне с двукратной иммунизацией VAC∆6 индуцирует наработку VACV-нейтрализующих антител и обеспечивает защиту мышей от дозы 150 LD50 ECTV. Предложенные схемы иммунизации могут быть использованы для разработки стратегии безопасной вакцинации против натуральной оспы и других ортопоксвирусных инфекций человека.",

Установлено, что пептид уменьшает отек лапы крыс, вызванный подкожным введением гистамина, в той же степени, что и классический противовоспалительный препарат диклофенак. Однако определение относительного уровня экспрессии гена cox-2 в очаге воспаления с помощью ПЦР в реальном времени показало, что, в отличие от диклофенака, PGP не влиял на экспрессию гена cox-2. Это свидетельствует о различии механизмов их действия. На экспериментальной модели острого перитонита, вызванного внутрибрюшинной инъекцией тиогликолата, показано, что воспалительная реакция сопровождается повышением проницаемости сосудов в тканях желудка и тонкого кишечника. Предварительное (за 30 мин до индукции воспаления) введение PGP предотвращало это повышение, вследствие чего проницаемость сосудов, объем экссудата в перитонеальной полости и количество красителя Evans Blue в нем оставались на уровне контрольных значений. Таким образом, полученные нами результаты свидетельствуют, что в основе противовоспалительного действия PGP лежит его способность предотвращать повышение проницаемости кровеносных сосудов.",

    "abstract": "Феномен клеточного старения впервые был описан как предел деления нормальных клеток в культуре. С момента первого упоминания и вплоть до недавнего времени основной акцент при изучении клеточного старения был сделан на внутриклеточных изменениях, сопровождающих этот процесс. Наибольшее внимание уделялось необратимой остановке пролиферации стареющих клеток и двум логично вытекающим физиологическим следствиям - супрессии канцерогенеза за счет ареста роста поврежденных клеток и ускорению организменного старения ввиду ухудшения репарации тканей с возрастом. Однако в настоящее время наблюдается смещение акцентов при исследовании клеточного старения. Оказалось, что стареющие клетки через ауто/паракринный механизм могут влиять на клетки микроокружения, секретируя множество различных факторов, включая цитокины, хемокины, протеазы и ростовые факторы. Такой профиль секретируемых стареющими клетками молекул получил название ассоциированного со старением секреторного фенотипа (senescence associated secretory phenotype, SASP). На сегодняшний день известно, что SASP опосредует участие стареющих клеток в самых разнообразных биологических процессах, включая регенерацию, ремоделирование тканей, эмбриогенез, воспаление и туморогенез. Настоящий обзор посвящен описанию «социальной жизни» стареющих клеток, а именно: составу, механизмам регуляции и функциональной роли ассоциированного со старением секреторного фенотипа.",

Рекомбинантный фактор IX человека, продуцируемый в культивируемых клетках линии СНО, практически эквивалентен природному фактору IX плазмы крови и широко используется в современной клинической практике. Получение биосимилярного рекомбинантного фактора IX человека предполагает создание клональной клеточной линии с максимально возможной удельной продуктивностью и высоким уровнем удельной прокоагуляционной активности секретируемого фактора IX. Ранее на основе нетранслируемых участков гена фактора элонгации трансляции 1альфа китайского хомячка нами было разработано семейство плазмидных векторов p1.1 и p1.2, позволяющее проводить амплификацию целевого гена в геноме клеток-продуцентов под действием метотрексата, а также котрансфекцию вспомогательных генов, сцепленных с различными селекционными маркерами. Природная область открытой рамки считывания гена фактора IX человека в векторе p1.1 была трансфицирована в клетки линии CHO DG44. В результате трех последовательных шагов амплификации и последующего клонирования получена линия клеток, продуцирующая фактор IX с удельной продуктивностью 10.7 ± 0.4 пг/клетка/день. Прокоагуляционная активность секретируемого фактора IX была практически полностью восстановлена путем котрансфекции клеток плазмидами семейства р1.2, несущими гены растворимого варианта протеазы PACE/furin и витамин К-оксидоредуктазы китайского хомячка. Клональная линия-продуцент 3B12-86 позволяла накапливать фактор IX в бессывороточной культуральной среде до концентрации 6 МЕ/мл при простом периодическом культивировании, при этом копийность интегрированного гена фактора IX составила всего 20 копий/геном, а интегрированных генов PACE/furin и VKORC1 - три и две копии/геном соответственно. Фактор IX человека, секретируемый линией 3B12-86, был очищен при помощи трех стадий хроматографии до удельной активности 230 МЕ/мг с выходом более 30%. Полученная клональная линия-продуцент фактора IX и метод очистки продукта позволяют вести экономически обоснованное промышленное производство биосимилярного рекомбинантного фактора IX для терапии гемофилии B.",

    "abstract": "The high genetic variability of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) leads to a constant emergence of new genetic variants, including the recombinant virus CRF63_02A1, which is widespread in the Siberian Federal District of Russia. We studied HIV-1 CRF63_02A1 integrase (IN_CRF) catalyzing the incorporation of viral DNA into the genome of an infected cell. The consensus sequence was designed, recombinant integrase was obtained, and its DNA-binding and catalytic activities were characterized. The stability of the IN_CRF complex with the DNA substrate did not differ from the complex stability for subtype A and B integrases; however, the rate of complex formation was significantly higher. The rates and efficiencies of 3'-processing and strand transfer reactions catalyzed by IN_CRF were found to be higher, too. Apparently, all these distinctive features of IN_CRF may result from specific amino acid substitutions in its N-terminal domain, which plays an important role in enzyme multimerization and binding to the DNA substrate. It was also found that the drug resistance mutations Q148K/G140S and G118R/E138K significantly reduce the catalytic activity of IN_CRF and its sensitivity to the strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir.

    "abstract": "In the reaction between tryptophan indole-lyase (TIL) and a substrate containing a bad leaving group (L-serine), general acid catalysis is required for the group's elimination. During this stage, the proton originally bound to the C atom of the substrate is transferred to the leaving group, which is eliminated as a water molecule. As a result, the basic group that had accepted the C proton at the previous stage has to be involved in the catalytic stage following the elimination in its basic form. On the other hand, when the substrate contains a good leaving group (-chloro-L-alanine), general acid catalysis is not needed at the elimination stage and cannot be implemented, because there are no functional groups in enzymes whose acidity is strong enough to protonate the elimination of a base as weak as Cl- anion. Consequently, the group that had accepted the C proton does not lose its additional proton during the elimination stage and should take part in the subsequent stage in its acidic (not basic) form. To shed light on the mechanistic consequences of the changes in the ionic state of this group, we have considered the pH dependencies of the main kinetic parameters for the reactions of TIL with L-serine and -chloro-L-alanine and the kinetic isotope effects brought about by replacement of the ordinary water used as a solvent with 2H2O. We have found that in the reaction between TIL and -chloro-L-alanine, the aminoacrylate hydrolysis stage is sensitive to the solvent isotope effect, while in the reaction with L-serine it is not. We have concluded that in the first reaction, the functional group containing an additional proton fulfills a definite catalytic function, whereas in the reaction with L-serine, when the additional proton is absent, the mechanism of hydrolysis of the aminoacrylate intermediate should be fundamentally different. Possible mechanisms were considered.",

Нами изучена возможность использования в качестве маркеров изменений концентрации катехоламинов в слезной жидкости больных с БП. Обнаружено, что концентрация норадреналина и дофамина у больных БП увеличена по сравнению с возрастным контролем, что более выражено на стороне появления двигательных симптомов. Напротив, концентрация адреналина в слезной жидкости больных снижена с обеих сторон. Поскольку нет оснований считать, что маркеры клинической стадии БП можно использовать и для диагностики доклинических стадий, изучен состав слезной жидкости у мышей при нейротоксическом моделировании доклинической и клинической стадий БП. Показано, что концентрация норадреналина в слезной жидкости мышей при моделировании клинической стадии БП выше, чем в контроле. На модели доклинической стадии обнаружена тенденция к увеличению концентрации норадреналина. Таким образом, у больных БП и у мышей на моделях доклинической и клинической стадий БП присутствуют однонаправленные изменения состава слезной жидкости, которые могут рассматриваться как перспективные биомаркеры для ранней диагностики этого заболевания.",

БВРС-КоВ вызывает острую инфекцию нижних дыхательных путей у человека, летальность при которой составляет ~35%. Зарегистрированные средства профилактической и терапевтической защиты против БВРС в насто ящее время отсутствуют. Гликопротеин S БВРС-КоВ играет важнейшую роль в интернализации вируса. Белок S является иммунодоминантным антигеном и основной мишенью для нейтрализующих антител. Нами проведено сравнение иммуногенности пяти различных форм гликопротеина S БВРС-КоВ: полнораз мерного гликопротеина S, полноразмерного гликопротеина S с трансмембранным доменом гликопротеина G вируса VSV (S-G), рецепторсвязывающего домена RBD гликопротеина S, мембраносвязанного RBD (слитого с трансмембранным доменом гликопротеина G вируса VSV, RBD-G) и RBD, слитого с Fc-фрагментом IgG1 человека (RBD-Fc). Для доставки использовали рекомбинантные векторы на основе аденовируса человека серотипа 5 (rAd5). Вакцинация мышей всеми разработанными векторами rAd5 позволила сформировать сбалансированный Th1/Th2-ответ. Наиболее мощный антительный ответ развивался при иммунизации животных мембраносвязанным RBD (rAd5-RBD-G). Формирование нейтрализующих антител у всех вак цинированных животных наблюдалось только при иммунизации мембранными формами гликопротеина (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G и rAd5-RBD-G). Наиболее выраженный клеточный ответ развивался при иммунизации животных полноразмерным S (rAd5-S). Проведенные исследования позволяют предположить, что среди всех изученных форм гликопротеина S наиболее перспективными для включения в вакцину против БВРС являются полноразмерный S и мембранная форма RBD (RBD-G).",

В семейство IL-1 входят более 11 белков, однако функции многих из них на сегодняшний день известны не до конца. В последнее время ведутся активные исследования биологических свойств интерлейкинов и находят новые члены семейства IL-1. В 2000 году несколькими независимыми группами ученых было сообщено об открытии нового интерлейкина данного семейства, который получил название IL-37, или по новой номенклатуре IL-1F7. IL-37 был отнесен к семейству IL-1 на основании его структурного сходства с другими членами данного семейства. Показано, что активность IL-37 изменяется при воспалительных заболеваниях, таких, как ревматоидный артрит, псориаз, а также при заболеваниях аллергической природы (аллергический ринит, бронхиальная астма и атопический дерматит). В отличие от большинства представителей семейства IL-1, IL-37 действует как негативный регулятор воспаления. Активация IL-37 приводит к супрессии воспаления, что выражается в подавлении воспалительных цитокинов и хемокинов и предотвращении инфильтрации провоспалительных клеток, главным образом, эозинофилов и нейтрофилов. Точные молекулярные и клеточные механизмы противовоспалительного действия IL-37 при развитии аллергических заболеваний (АЗ) на данный момент недостаточно раскрыты. В представленном обзоре обобщены и проанализированы экспериментальные данные о роли IL-37 в патогенезе АЗ, таких, как аллергический ринит, бронхиальная астма и атопический дерматит.",

    "abstract": "Процесс оплодотворения (слияние гамет с образованием зиготы) регулируется при участии парных молекул, обеспечивающих распознавание гамет на ключевых этапах их взаимодействия, таких, как привлечение сперматозоида аттрактантами яйцеклетки, разрушение вителлиновой оболочки акросомными белками сперматозоида и др. Несовместимость гамет - это один из механизмов репродуктивной изоляции. Несовместимость гамет основана на видоспецифичности молекул взаимодействия гамет и проявляется в нарушении распознавания гетероспецифичных гамет при оплодотворении. Хотя несовместимость гамет может проявляться у любых организмов, размножающихся половым путем, известно сравнительно мало модельных систем для ее изучения. Взаимодействия гамет у представителей разных таксонов основаны на сходных процессах, однако в них могут участвовать негомологичные молекулы. Как и в случае белков иммунитета, при изучении белков распознавания гамет, практически во всех группах животных обнаруживали новые семейства белков, многие из которых вовлечены в молекулярные механизмы несовместимости гамет, что отражает многократные эволюционные пути ее становления/поддержания. Несовместимость гамет может реализовываться на любом этапе оплодотворения и проявляться на разных таксономических уровнях - от полной несовместимости у близких видов до частичной несовместимости у животных разных классов.",

Ранее у человека и мыши были обнаружены днРНК (DEANR1 и LL35/Falcor соответственно), расположенные в геномном окружении в непосредственной близости от транскрипционного фактора Foxa2. В данной работе показана тканеспецифическая экспрессия днРНК LL35/Falcor в печени и легких мыши. Применение антисмысловых олигонуклеотидов позволило на 90% подавить экспрессию днРНК LL35/Falcor. При этом уменьшилось количество мРНК и белка Foxa2, что подтверждает участие днРНК LL35/Falcor в регуляции фактора транскрипции Foxa2. Нами показано снижение экспрессии днРНК LL35 при фиброзе печени, что коррелирует с выявленным ранее уменьшением количества мРНК фактора Foxa2. Таким образом, днРНК LL35 регулирует экспрессию Foxa2 в печени не только в норме, но и при фиброзе, что позволяет рассматривать эту днРНК в качестве биомаркера этого патологического процесса.",

    "abstract": "В ответ на неблагоприятные воздействия клетки многоклеточных организмов могут подвергаться запрограммированной гибели - апоптозу. Нарушения этого процесса приводят к развитию различных заболеваний человека. На сегодняшний день известно два типа апоптоза - каспаз-зависимый, при котором происходит расщепление клеточных белков, и каспаз-независимый, обусловленный разрывами молекул ДНК. Главную роль в апоптозе второго типа, по-видимому, более консервативном и эволюционно древнем, играет белок AIF. Ключевым этапом каспаз-независимого апоптоза является диссоциация AIF от наружной митохондриальной мембраны (НММ), однако механизм регуляции взаимодействия AIF с НММ до сих пор не установлен. В данной работе мы впервые показали, что AIF может закрепляться на НММ благодаря взаимодействию с белком Морталином. Нами подтверждено связывание этих белков in vitro и in vivo, а также картированы участки аминокислотной последовательности, необходимые для этого взаимодействия. Показано, что индукция апоптоза противоопухолевыми препаратами приводит к распаду комплекса AIF-Морталин и диссоциации AIF от НММ. Наконец, с использованием биоинформатического анализа установлено, что повышенная экспрессия Морталина в клетках глиобластомы коррелирует с плохим клиническим прогнозом. Все эти данные указывают на важную роль Морталина в регуляции каспаз-независимого апоптоза и позволяют предположить, что ингибирование взаимодействия AIF-Морталин приведет к диссоциации AIF от НММ и последующей гибели опухолевых клеток.",

Изучена способность тестируемых веществ формировать трансмембранные поры, влиять на электрическую стабильность липидных бислоев и плавление насыщенных фосфохолинов, а также вызывать деформацию, слияние или деление липидных везикул. Установлено, что оба соединения проявляют детергентные свойства в отношении модельных мембран. Результаты, полученные методом дифференциальной сканирующей микрокалориметрии и путем измерения трансмембранного напряжения, при котором в присутствии тестируемых соединений происходит разрушение липидных бислоев, указывают, что оба производных вызывают разупорядочивание мембранных липидов. Показан синергизм разобщающего действия тестируемых производных и алкалоида капсаицина на модельные липидные мембраны. Пороговая концентрация вещества, вызывающая увеличение ионной проницаемости липидного бислоя, зависит от липидного состава мембраны. В случае отрицательно заряженных липидных бислоев она на порядок ниже, чем у электрически нейтральных. Это может быть обусловлено положительным зарядом молекул тестируемых агентов. При этом ЛХТА-2701 характеризуется большей эффективностью по сравнению с ЛХТА-1975. ЛХТА-2701 не только обладает детергентным действием, но и способен индуцировать ион-проницаемые трансмембранные поры, функционирование которых выражается в появлении ступенеобразных флуктуаций трансмембранного тока. Различие механизмов действия определяется особенностями строения этих веществ: в молекуле ЛХТА-1975 все три заместителя при атомах азота индольных циклов одинаковы и представляют собой н -алкильные группы (пентильные), а ЛХТА-2701 содержит наряду с двумя алкильными заместителями ( н -пропильными) малеинимидный цикл. Полученные результаты важны для понимания механизмов действия новых антибактериальных агентов, отличий в селективности их действия на микроорганизмы-мишени и токсичности в отношении клеток человека, а также показывают целесообразность использования модельных липидных мембран для дальнейшего изучения направлений модификации и совершенствования структуры новых антибактериальных средств.",

Несмотря на достаточно длительную историю применения, вопрос о структурных изменениях системы адаптивного иммунитета в результате аутологичной ТГСК у пациентов с различными типами АЗ остается малоизученным. C помощью массированного секвенирования нами изучены изменения структуры клонального репертуара Т-лимфоцитов периферической крови у взрослых пациентов с анкилозирующим спондилитом (АС) в результате аутологичной ТГСК на протяжении 2 лет восстановительного периода. Применение техники молекулярного баркодирования позволило в существенной степени снизить влияние искажений, возникающих в ходе пробоподготовки, провести сравнительный анализ различных характеристик Т-клеточного репертуара между разными временными точками и отследить динамику отдельных групп клонотипов и субпопуляций Т-лимфоцитов. Клональное разнообразие Т-клеточного репертуара оставалось значительно сниженным по сравнению с исходным в течение первого года восстановительного периода у обоих пациентов, продолжив увеличиваться на протяжении всех 24 мес. наблюдения, и у одного пациента достигло нормального значения для данной возрастной группы. Рост разнообразия связан с появлением большого числа низкопредставленных клонотипов, которые не были выявлены в образцах до трансплантации. Детектируемость клонотипов после ТГСК в значительной степени зависела от их представленности в исходном репертуаре. Практически все из 100 клонотипов, наиболее высокопредставленных до ТГСК, обнаружены в репертуаре 2 года спустя и остались при этом высокопредставленными независимо от принадлежности к CD8+ или CD4+ субпопуляции Т-лимфоцитов. До 25% Т-клеток периферической крови через 2 года после ТГСК были представлены клонотипами первоначального репертуара.",

    "abstract": "Пигментный эпителий сетчатки представляет собой монослой пигментированных гексагональных клеток, соединенных плотными контактами. Эти клетки составляют часть внешнего барьера между кровью и сетчаткой, защищают глаз от излишнего света, обладают важными секреторными функциями, а также поддерживают работу фоторецепторов, обеспечивая координацию множества регуляторных механизмов. Именно дегенерация пигментного эпителия является первопричиной многих дегенеративных заболеваний сетчатки глаза. Поиск надежных источников клеток для трансплантации пигментного эпителия сетчатки представляет крайне актуальную задачу. Плюрипотентные стволовые клетки (эмбриональные стволовые или индуцированные плюрипотентные) можно с высокой эффективностью дифференцировать в пигментный эпителий сетчатки, что открывает возможности для клеточной терапии при дегенерации сетчатки и может позволить замедлить развитие патологии и даже, возможно, вернуть пациенту зрение. Пионерские работы по трансплантации клеток пигментного эпителия сетчатки, дифференцированных из плюрипотентных стволовых клеток, проводимые в США и Японии, подтверждают необходимость развития и оптимизации подобных подходов к клеточной терапии. Для эффективного применения клетки пигментного эпителия, дифференцированные из плюрипотентных стволовых клеток, должны иметь набор функциональных свойств, характерный для клеток пигментного эпителия in vivo. В этом обзоре обобщен текущий статус доклинических и клинических исследований в области заместительной терапии пигментного эпителия сетчатки. На основании собственных и опубликованных данных проведено сравнение разных протоколов дифференцировки, обозначены медицинские проблемы, стоящие на пути к широкому применению пигментного эпителия сетчатки, дифференцированного из плюрипотентных стволовых клеток.",

    "abstract": "Септины - наименее изученный элемент цитоскелета, входят в состав консервативного, недавно открытого семейства GTP-связывающих белков. Септины экспрессируются нейронами и взаимодействуют с целым рядом белков, принимающих участие в процессах экзо-эндоцитоза синаптических везикул. Однако наши знания о роли септинов в механизмах синаптической передачи и пресинаптического везикулярного цикла недостаточны. В опытах на двигательных нервных окончаниях диафрагмы мыши с использованием внутриклеточного микроэлектродного отведения постсинаптических сигналов, флуоресцентной конфокальной микроскопии и красителя FM 1-43 исследованы процессы секреции медиатора и экзо-эндоцитоза синаптических везикул в условиях стимуляции полимеризации септинов форхлорфенуроном. Обнаружено, что аппликация форхлорфенурона приводит к усилению депрессии секреции медиатора в процессе дли тельного высокочастотного раздражения (20 и 50 имп/с). Раздражение двумя короткими высокочастотными пачками импульсов показало, что форхлорфенурон вызывает снижение скорости восполнения запаса готового к освобождению медиатора. На фоне действия форхлорфенурона в нервном окончании увеличивалось количество везикул, захвативших краситель во время эндоцитоза, замедлялся темп выброса флуоресцентного красителя в предварительно загруженных FM 1-43 нервных окончаниях при экзоцитозе. Сделано заключение, что стимуляция полимеризации септинов форхлорфенуроном приводит к замедлению рециклирования (повторного использования) синаптических везикул в двигательных нервных окончаниях, связанного с нарушением процессов везикулярного транспорта.",

    "abstract": "В реакции триптофан-индол-лиазы (ТИЛ) с субстратом, содержащим плохую уходящую группу ( L -серин), необходим общекислотный катализ на стадии ее отщепления. В ходе этой стадии происходит формальный перенос протона из α-положения субстрата к уходящей группе, при этом отщепляется вода. В результате группа, первоначально акцептировавшая C α -протон, в последующей каталитической стадии должна выступать в виде соответствующего сопряженного основания. Когда субстрат содержит хорошую уходящую группу (β-хлор- L -аланин), общекислотный катализ на стадии элиминирования не является необходимым и не может быть реализован, поскольку в ферментах отсутствуют сильные кислотные группы, которые могли бы отдать свой протон столь слабому основанию, как отщепляющийся анион хлора. Таким образом каталитическая группа, первоначально принявшая С α -протон от субстрата, должна вступить в последующую стадию в кислотной, а не основной форме. Для выяснения механистических последствий изменений ионного состояния этой группы для реакций ТИЛ с нестандартными субстратами - L -серином и β-хлор- L -аланином, рассмотрены рН-зависимости основных кинетических параметров процесса и кинетические изотопные эффекты, обусловленные заменой обычной воды в качестве растворителя на 2 Н 2 О. Установлено, что в реакции ТИЛ с β-хлор- L -аланином стадия гидролиза аминоакрилатного интермедиата чувствительна к изотопному эффекту растворителя, а в случае реакции с L -серином - нет. Показано, что в ходе первой реакции функциональная группа, содержащая «дополнительный» протон, выполняет конкретную каталитическую функцию, тогда как в реакции с L -серином, когда отсутствует этот протон, механизм гидролиза аминоакрилата должен быть принципиально иным. На основании полученных результатов предложены возможные механизмы гидролиза аминоакрилата в реакциях ТИЛ с L -серином и β-хлор- L -аланином.",

    "abstract": "Одним из принципиальных отличий многих типов опухолевых клеток от клеток нормальных тканей является транслокация на поверхность плазматической мембраны ряда внутриклеточных протеинов, в частности белка теплового шока 70 кДа (HSP70). Продемонстрировано, что такая необычная поверхностная локализация HSP70 распознается цитотоксическими эффекторами иммунной системы и приводит к усилению их цитолитического действия на данные клетки-мишени. Механизмы этого взаимодействия до конца не раскрыты, однако феномен поверхностной локализации HSP70 на раковых клетках может быть использован для разработки новых подходов к противоопухолевой иммунотерапии. В то же время известно, что присутствие HSP70 на клеточной поверхности не является универсальным признаком раковых клеток. Многие разновидности опухолевых тканей не экспрессируют мембрано-ассоциированные HSP70, что ограничивает потенциальные клинические возможности указанных подходов. В связи с этим в качестве одного из перспективных направлений противоопухолевой иммунотерапии можно рассматривать направленную доставку на поверхность раковых клеток экзогенных HSP70 с целью привлечения и активации цитотоксических эффекторов иммунной системы. Для осуществления адресной доставки HSP70 в опухолевые ткани можно использовать молекулярные конструкции, содержащие рекомбинантные мини-антитела к опухолеассоциированным антигенам, в частности, к HER2/neu-антигену и другим маркерам, высоко экспрессирующимся на поверхности широкого спектра раковых клеток. С целью оценки возможности и эффективности применения указанного подхода, в данном исследовании были созданы двухмодульные рекомбинантные конструкции, содержащие в первом модуле мини-антитела к HER2/neuантигену, а во втором модуле - молекулу HSP70 или ее фрагмент. Избирательное взаимодействие белковых модулей обеспечивалось состыковочным звеном, образуемым входящей в состав молекулярной конструкции парой барназа:барстар - гетеродимером с уникально высокой константой взаимодействия. Результаты, полученные при тестировании указанных препаратов в моделях in vitro, продемонстрировали селективное связывание разработанных конструкций с опухолевыми клетками, экспрессирующими HER2/neu-антиген, и достоверное стимулирующее действие этих препаратов на цитотоксическую активность клеток-эффекторов иммунной системы по отношению к соответствующим клеткам-мишеням.",

Приведены современные данные о происхождении и функции микроглии в эмбриогенезе спинного мозга млекопитающих. Проанализированы основные подходы к классификации микроглиоцитов на основании их морфофункциональных и иммунофенотипических особенностей. Обобщены результаты исследований, проведенных на экспериментальных моделях таких заболеваний спинного мозга, как рассеянный склероз, боковой амиотрофический склероз, системное воспаление и др. Подчеркнута ключевая роль микроглии в патогенезе этих заболеваний. Отмечена необходимость идентификации специфических для клеток микроглии белков, экспрессирующихся на всех этапах онтогенеза, а также необходимость совершенствования иммуногистохимических и генетических методов выявления микроглиоцитов спинного мозга в норме и патологии. Представлены возможные способы морфометрии, применяемые для оценки функциональной активности микроглиальных клеток.",

После 28 дней воздействия стресса наблюдали усиление депрессивных реакций мышей в тесте «вынужденное плавание» и уменьшение уровней серотонина (5-НТ) и 5-оксииндолуксусной кислоты (5-ОИУК) в гиппокампе, повышение концентрации норадреналина (НА) в гипоталамусе.

Антидепрессивный эффект флуоксетина, но не амитриптилина, после однократного введения сочетался с увеличением обмена 5-НТ в гиппокампе. Хроническое введение антидепрессантов приводило к повышению уровней НА в гипоталамусе.

О метаболитах фекалий известно существенно меньше, чем о метаболитах сыворотки крови, мочи, слюны и цереброспинальной жидкости. Несмотря на инструментальные и методологические достижения метаболомного анализа в целом, анализ фекального метаболома развит существенно хуже главным образом из-за негомогенности состава и отсутствия стандартизированных методов сбора, подготовки и непосредственного анализа образцов. В нашем обзоре суммирована информация о методах изучения метаболитов фекалий, описаны их группы, а также оценен потенциал их использования в диагностике заболеваний желудочно-кишечного тракта.",

Базисными препаратами, используемыми в терапии пузырчатки, являются системные глюкокортикостероиды, длительное применение которых приводит к развитию тяжелых осложнений. При стероидорезистентных, тяжелых формах пузырчатки используются адъювантные, в том числе экстракорпоральные, методы терапии. Наиболее эффективным и безопасным из методов экстракорпоральной терапии считается иммуносорбция, основанная на удалении аутоантител из крови больных с помощью иммуносорбентов. Существующие в настоящее время иммуносорбенты не обладают селективностью, их использование увеличивает риск развития инфекционных заболеваний, в связи с чем актуальным представляется создание сорбентов, селективно элиминирующих антитела к десмоглеину 3 типа (Dsg3) из сыворотки крови пациентов с пузырчаткой. Для селективного удаления аутоантител из сыворотки крови больных вульгарной пузырчаткой нами разработан иммуносорбент на основе агарозной матрицы Affigel 15 и рекомбинантного десмоглеина 3 типа человека в качестве лиганда. В экспериментах in vivо (на мышах линии Balb/c, в качестве модели пузырчатки) и in vitrо показано, что созданный иммуносорбент способен направленно элиминировать аутоантитела класса G к десмоглеину 3 типа. Полученные результаты позволяют заключить, что синтезированный селективный иммуносорбент Affigel 15–Dsg3 обладает совокупностью свойств, предопределяющих перспективность разработки твердофазных матриц и их применения в терапии больных вульгарной пузырчаткой.",

    "abstract": "Примерно 90% всех злокачественных опухолей имеют эпителиальную природу. Эпителиальная ткань характеризуется тесной связью клеток между собой и тесной связью клеток с базальной мембраной, определяющей их полярность. Эти связи строго определяют положение клеток в пространстве и, казалось бы, противоречат способности многих опухолей к метастазированию (основной критерий злокачественности опухоли). Однако именно диссеминация опухоли из первичного источника в жизненно важные органы является основной причиной смертности пациентов при онкологической патологии. В основе опухолевой диссеминации лежит так называемый эпителиально-мезенхимальный переход (ЭМП) – процесс, при котором эпителиальные клетки трансформируются в мезенхимальные, обладающие высокой подвижностью и способностью к миграции. Количество публикаций, освещающих роль ЭМП не только в процессах метастазирования, но и в других сторонах опухолевой прогрессии, растет с каждым годом, формируя активно расширяющуюся область научного интереса в онкологии. В обзоре рассмотрены последние данные о внутриклеточных и внеклеточных молекулярных механизмах, активирующих ЭМП, их роли в таких аспектах опухолевой прогрессии, как метастазирование, устойчивость к апоптозу и уход от иммунного надзора, которые ранее связывали исключительно с существованием так называемых стволовых опухолевых клеток. Подробно рассмотрены одобренные и перспективные для противоопухолевой терапии таргетные препараты, использующие в качестве мишени компоненты сигнальных путей ЭМП.",

    "abstract": "Глиома – наиболее агрессивный вид опухолей головного мозга. Высокая частота диагностируемых случаев глиомы, риск образования метастазов, низкая эффективность традиционной терапии и неутешительный прогноз для пациентов диктуют необходимость поиска альтернативных или комбинированных подходов к своевременной диагностике и лечению данной патологии. Особые перспективы связывают с применением антистоксовых нанофосфоров (НАФ). В настоящей работе получены и охарактеризованы НАФ, содержащие редкоземельные элементы иттербий и тулий. Эти НАФ имеют максимумы эмиссии фотолюминесценции в видимой и инфракрасной областях спектра, что дает возможность глубокой оптической визуализации опухолевых клеток в головном мозге. Исследована токсичность НАФ в отношении нормальных клеток нервной системы и клеток глиомы. Показано, что НАФ не оказывают цитотоксического действия на опухолевые клетки, однако в высоких концентрациях проявляют умеренный цитотоксический эффект в первичных нейрональных культурах, характеризующийся снижением жизнеспособности и изменением функциональной активности нейроглиальных сетей. Высокая перспективность применения НАФ в качестве люминесцентных маркеров делает необходимым изучение скорости накопления и выведения НАФ в опухолевых и здоровых клетках нервной системы, а также возможностей модификации поверхности наночастиц для снижения токсических эффектов.",

Биолюминесценция основана на химической реакции окисления низкомолекулярного субстрата (люциферина) кислородом воздуха, катализируемой ферментом (люциферазой). Релаксация продукта окисления люциферина из возбужденного состояния сопровождается высвобождением кванта света, который может быть зарегистрирован как аналитический сигнал. Возможность экспрессии генов люцифераз в различных гетерологических системах и высокие квантовые выходы реакции люминесценции определяют популярность этих инструментов в биологии и медицине. Из нескольких десятков известных природных люцифераз некоторые нашли практическое применение. Размер люциферазы, длина волны максимума люминесценции, термостабильность фермента, рН-оптимум реакции, потребность в кофакторах – все эти параметры могут отличаться у люцифераз из различных групп организмов, что оказывает непосредственное влияние на выбор области применения каждого фермента. Современным исследователям важно проанализировать все многообразие доступных люцифераз и их биохимических свойств для выбора оптимальной биолюминесцентной метки, подходящей для решения конкретной задачи.",

Летальность при БВРС составляет 34.5%. В связи с высокой летальностью, отсутствием терапевтических и профилактических средств и сохраняющейся угрозой распространения БВРС за пределы эндемичных районов разработка вакцинного препарата является актуальной задачей, а вакцинопрофилактика против БВРС позволит ограничить распространение БВРС и снизить летальность. Нами была разработана комбинированная векторная вакцина для профилактики БВРС на основе рекомбинантных аденовирусов человека 26 и 5 серотипа. Проведенные исследования иммуногенности показали, что вакцинация животных (мыши и приматы) позволяет сформировать мощный гуморальный иммунный ответ, который сохраняется на протяжении не менее 6 месяцев. Исследования клеточного иммунного ответа у мышей после вакцинации показали формирование выраженного специфического CD4 + и CD8 + ответа. По результатам исследования протективности вакцины на модели трансгенных мышей, несущих ген рецептора DPP4 человека, было показано, что вакцинация обеспечивает защиту 100% животных от летальной инфекции, вызванной вирусом БВРС-КоВ (MERS-CoV EMC/2012, 100 ЛД 50 /мышь). Проведенные исследования безопасности и переносимости разработанной вакцины у грызунов, кроликов и приматов показали хорошую переносимость вакцины у животных и не выявили противопоказаний для проведения клинических исследований.",

В этом гене обнаружены мутации, а также множество полиморфных участков, в том числе динуклеотидный микросателлит SNCA -Rep1. Механизмы, посредством которых определенная конфигурация SNCA -Rep1, возможно, способствует развитию болезни Паркинсона, до настоящего времени не уточнены. На российской популяции подтверждена связь длинных аллелей SNCA -Rep1 с болезнью Паркинсона. Также показано, что длинные аллельные варианты SNCA -Rep1 ассоциированы с гипометилированием CpG-сайтов в интроне 1 гена SNCA . Предполагается, что влияние длинных вариантов SNCA -Rep1 реализуется именно через гипометилирование транскрипционно значимой области гена: гипометилирование обычно связано с повышением экспрессии, что, в свою очередь, способствует накоплению в цитоплазме нейронов альфа-синуклеина – основного молекулярного маркера болезни Паркинсона. Необходимы дальнейшие исследования, которые помогут связать полученные результаты с уровнем экспрессии гена SNCA .",

Ес Lon функционирует как гомоолигомер, субъединица которого включает центральный характеристический ААА + -модуль, С-концевой протеазный домен, а также N-концевую некаталитическую область, образованную двумя доменами – собственно N-концевым и вставочным α-спирализованным. Анализ пространственной структуры N-домена позволил выявить остатки E34, K35 и R38 на поверхности молекулы фермента, предположительно вовлеченные в формирование стабильной, функционально активной Ec Lon-протеазы. Получен тройной мутант LonEKR, несущий замены остатков E34, K35 и R38 на аланин. Показано, что введение указанных замен влияет на конформационную стабильность и межцентровые аллостерические взаимодействия в ферменте, обусловленные действием нуклеотидов, а также на формирование корректного сайта связывания белкового субстрата.",

    "abstract": "Внутриклеточные протоны играют особую роль в регуляции пресинаптических процесcов, поскольку функционирование синаптических везикул и эндосомных структур зависит от закисления их содержимого H + -помпой. Более того, при синаптической активности в нервных окончаниях происходит закисление цитоплазмы. С использованием микроэлектродной регистрации постсинаптических сигналов (показатель секреции нейромедиатора) и экзо-эндоцитозного маркера FM1-43 нами изучено влияние закисления цитоплазмы пропионатом на пресинаптические процессы, обеспечивающие освобождение нейромедиатора. Обнаружено, что в диафрагме мыши и кожно-грудинной мышце лягушки внутриклеточный ацидоз вызывает выраженное снижение секреции нейромедиатора в начальную минуту 20 Гц-стимуляции. Это сопровождается резким замедлением освобождения FM1-43 в ходе экзоцитоза синаптических везикул в ответ на стимуляцию. Экcперименты с оценкой захвата FM1-43 показали отсутствие нарушений эндоцитоза синаптических везикул. Закисление полностью предотвращало действие проникающего через мембраны агента (24-гидроксихолестерина), усиливающего мобилизацию синаптических везикул. Мы предполагаем, что повышение [H + ] in угнетает нейропередачу за счет замедления доставки синаптических везикул в сайты экзоцитоза при интенсивной активности. Этот механизм может регулировать секрецию нейромедиатора по принципу отрицательной обратной связи.",

В развитии МДС участвуют как генетические, так и эпигенетические факторы, включая микроРНК – короткие некодирующие РНК, которые являются важными регуляторами нормального гемопоэза. Нарушение экспрессии микроРНК может способствовать развитию гематологических опухолей. Для прогноза течения МДС используется международная система оценки, которая учитывает кариотип, количество бластных клеток и степень дефицита различных клеток крови. Однако общая выживаемость и эффективность проводимой терапии не всегда соответствуют прогнозу. Поиск новых биомаркеров с последующей их интеграцией в прогностическую систему позволит максимально персонализировать проводимую терапию.

В представленной работе эффективность двух адамантильных азагетероциклических производных римантадина изучена на модели гриппозной пневмонии мышей, индуцированной римантадин-резистентным вирусом гриппа А/Калифорния/04/2009 (H1N1). Мыши BALB/с, инфицированные вирусом, получали препараты перорально в дозах 15 и 20 мг/кг/день в течение 5 дней (первую дозу давали за 4 ч до инфицирования). Эффективность препаратов оценивали по выживаемости животных, продолжительности жизни, уменьшению потери массы и титра вируса в легких. Лечение обоими соединениями в указанных дозах обеспечивало защиту 60–100% животных, увеличивало среднюю продолжительность жизни, снижало потерю веса и ингибировало размножение вируса в легких по сравнению с группой вирусного контроля. Оба соединения были более эффективными, чем римантадин в аналогичных дозах и схеме. Изучение чувствительности вирусов, выделенных из легких животных, получавших перорально в течение 5 дней соединения, в культуре клеток MDCK, не выявило возникновения резистентности.",

The objective of this study was to experimentally evaluate a diagnostic challenge test with monoiodotyrosine (MIT), an endogenous inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase. Striatal dopamine was shown to decrease by 34% 2 h after subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/kg MIT to intact mice, with the effect not being amplified by a further increase in the MIT dose. The selected MIT dose caused motor impairment in a neurotoxic mouse model of preclinical PD, but not in the controls. This was because MIT reduced striatal dopamine to the threshold of motor symptoms manifestation only in PD mice. Therefore, using the experimental mouse model of preclinical PD, we have shown that a MIT challenge test may be used to detect latent nigrostriatal dysfunction.",

Основные классы таких соединений – кардиотоксины кобр, фосфолипазы А2, натрийуретические и брадикинин-потенцирующие пептиды. Имеется еще группа белков, которые могут усиливать ангиогенез и включают, например, эндотелиальные факторы роста сосудов, обладающие гипотензивным и кардиопротекторным эффектом.
