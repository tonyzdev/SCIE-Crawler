    "abstract": "Abstract Sustainable fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites from renewable and biodegradable fibrous materials and polymer matrices are of great interest, as they can potentially reduce environmental impacts. However, the overall properties of such composites are still far from the high‐performance conventional glass or carbon FRP composites. Therefore, a balance between composite performance and biodegradability is required with approaches to what one might call an eco‐friendly composite. This review provides an overview of sustainable FRP composites, their manufacturing techniques, and sustainability in general at materials, manufacturing, and end‐of‐life levels. Sustainable plant‐based natural fibers and polymer matrices are also summarized, followed by an overview of their modification techniques to obtain high‐performance, multifunctional, and sustainable FRP composites. Current state‐of‐the‐art mechanical and functional properties of such composites are then surveyed, and an overview of their potential applications in various industries, including automobile, aerospace, construction, medical, sports, and electronics is provided. Finally, future market trends, current challenges, and the future perspective on sustainable natural FRP composites are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract CO 2 emission has raised worldwide concerns because of its potential effects on climate change, species extinction, and plant nutrition deterioration. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are one class of crystalline adsorbent materials that are believed to be of huge potential in CO 2 capture applications because of their advantages such as ultrahigh porosity, boundless chemical tunability, and surface functionality over traditional porous zeolites and activated carbon. In terms of chemistry, there are already many studies devoted to the synthesis of new functional MOFs. Some of the synthesized MOFs have been evaluated for CO 2 capture at laboratory‐scale. Several reviews have been published on this topic, but mainly from a chemistry and materials point of view. In this review, the authors focus on the engineering perspective on this topic, with emphases on material evaluation, performance judgment, and process design to address the engineering issues of these materials to be used as adsorbents in industrial CO 2 capture. The current engineering evaluation approaches for MOFs are summarized, in a manner that could also be applied to other adsorbent materials.",

    "abstract": "The conversion of solar energy into heat for solar steam generation is significant for energy saving and clean water supply. Recent advances in the design and application of photothermal‐based water‐evaporation systems have attracted intense research interest. However, it is imperative to develop a low‐cost and scalable photothermal system with further improved energy conversion efficiency to meet the demand for real‐world applications. Inspired by the natural transpiration process of plants, a wood‐polydopamine‐based photothermal material is developed for solar‐steam generation. Both the wood and polydopamine (PDA) derived from natural products are cost‐effective, biodegradable, and environmentally friendly. The wood–PDA system evaporates thin water film right above the bulk water surface, leading to extremely high efficiencies. Solar steam can be generated only 5 s after light irradiation. The solar‐steam generation efficiency reaches 87% under 1.0 sun. More significantly, an explosive evaporation which bypasses the phase change from liquid to gas is observed on the wood surface under irradiation of more‐intense light. This yields a solar‐steam generation efficiency (calculated by the classic equation) beyond 100% (e.g., 135% under 3.5 sun). It is envisioned that this strategy can be readily applied in practical solar‐evaporation applications due to its simplicity, low cost, and high efficiency.",

For this reason, developing cost‐effective and efficient photocatalysts for environmental remediation is a growing need, and semiconductor photocatalysts have now received more interest owing to their excellent activity and stability. Recently, several metal oxides, sulfides, and nitrides‐based semiconductors for water splitting and photodegradation of pollutants have been developed. However, the existing challenges, such as high over potential, wide band gap as well as fast recombination of charge carriers of most of the semiconductors limit their photocatalytic properties. This review summarizes the recent state‐of‐the‐art first‐principles research progress in the design of effective visible‐light‐response semiconductor photocatalysts through several modification processes with a focus on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Recent developments to the exchange‐correlation effect, such as hybrid functionals, DFT + U as well as methods beyond DFT are also emphasized. Recent discoveries on the origin, fundamentals, and the underlying mechanisms of the interfacial electron transfer, band gap reduction, enhanced optical absorption, and electron–holes separation are presented. Highlights on the challenges and proposed strategies in developing advanced semiconductor photocatalysts for the application in water splitting and degradation of pollutants are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Semiconductor photocatalysis is currently attracting tremendous attention as it holds great potential to address the issues of energy shortage and environmental pollution. 2D materials are excellent candidates for photocatalysis owing to their attractive structural and electronic properties. However, practical applications of 2D materials are still hindered due to limitations, such as fast electron–hole recombination and poor redox ability, both of which lead to low efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Constructing a heterojunction is the most widely used strategy to solve these problems. In particular, heterojunctions composed of 2D materials interfaced with other semiconductors of different dimensionalities can integrate the respective advantages and mitigate the drawbacks of each component. Hence, this review focuses on the recent developments in the rational design of 2D material‐based heterojunction photocatalysts with different configurations. The synthetic strategies, physicochemical properties, component functions, photocatalytic mechanisms, and applications of these heterojunctions are systematically summarized. Emphasis is placed on correlations between photocatalytic performance and heterojunction configuration. Finally, the ongoing challenges and potential directions for future development of 2D material‐based heterojunction photocatalysts are also proposed.",

However, conventional OER catalysts are of low electrochemical efficiency while the state‐of‐the‐art nanoparticle‐based catalysts require mechanical supports, thereby limiting their wide deployment. Here, it is demonstrated that, due to the excellent corrosion resistance of the Fe–Co–Ni–Cr–Nb high entropy intermetallic Laves phase, fabricating a high entropy bulk porous nanostructure is possible by dealloying the corresponding eutectic alloy precursor. As a result, a core–shell nanostructure with amorphous high entropy oxide ultrathin films wrapped around the nanosized intermetallic ligaments is obtained, which together, exhibits an extraordinarily large active surface area, fast dynamics, and superb long‐term durability, outperforming the existing alloy‐ and ceramic‐based OER electrocatalysts. The outcome of the research suggests that the paradigm of “high entropy” design can be used to develop high performance catalytic materials.",

Physicochemical and functional properties of BCs can be enhanced by several methods of activation or functionalization. The activated and functionalized BCs with a large surface area and abundant surface functional groups can serve as effective catalysts or catalyst supports for various chemical transformations as well as for adsorption/sorption/enrichment of low‐concentration pollutant streams. Among them, remediation of environmental contaminants and production of a range of bioproducts in biorefineries have attracted much attention in the context of achieving green and sustainable development. Although the applications of BC as adsorbents in removal of pollutants have been discussed extensively, there is a lot of untapped potential with new applications of BCs as catalysts or catalyst supports for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and sustainable biorefineries. In this review, the production and activation/functionalization of BCs are scrutinized. The mechanisms of activated and functionalized BC and BC‐supported catalysts in degradation of organic contaminants via AOPs assisted with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), peroxydisulfate (PDS), and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) are reviewed. Emerging applications of BC as catalyst for production of biodiesel and high‐value chemicals, tar removal, bio‐syngas reforming, and energy storage and conversion devices are discussed in detail.",

However, the current membrane technology, involving relatively expensive synthetic materials, is often nonsustainable for the poorest communities in the society. In this article, perspectives are provided on the emerging nanocellulose‐enabled membrane technology based on nanoscale cellulose fibers that can be extracted from almost any biomass. It is conceivable that nanocellulose membranes developed from inexpensive, abundant, and sustainable resources (such as agriculture residues and underutilized biomass waste) can lower the cost of membrane separation, as these membranes offer the ability to remove a range of pollutants in one step, via size exclusion and/or adsorption. The nanocellulose‐enabled membrane technology not only may be suitable for tackling global drinking water challenges, but it can also provide a new low‐cost platform for various pressure‐driven filtration techniques, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis. Some relevant parameters that can control the filtration performance of nanocellulose‐enabled membranes are comprehensively discussed.

Such lands cover ≈1 000 000 km 2 in Europe, which is almost 10% of the total surface area. In many countries, peatlands have been artificially drained over centuries, leading to not only enormous emissions of CO 2 but also soil subsidence, mobilization of nutrients, higher flood risks, and loss of biodiversity. These problems can largely be solved by stopping drainage and rewetting the land. Wet peatlands do not release CO 2 , can potentially sequester carbon, help to improve water quality, provide habitat for rare and threatened biodiversity, and can still be used for production of biomass (“paludiculture”). Wisely adjusted land use on peatlands can substantially contribute to low‐emission goals and further benefits for farmers, the economy, society, and the environment.",

These practical applications require materials that fulfil several requirements: being low cost, being scalable in terms of processing, being environmentally friendly, and having a high, stable optical–thermal conversion efficiency of solar vaporization. Currently, biomass materials show very promising prospects for ISSG systems. Here, it is observed that bamboo charcoal (BC) possesses a series of unique advantages that make it a highly efficient ISSG device. The broadband light absorption and the arched and porous structural features of BC fulfil all the basic requirements of an ISSG device in localized heating, heat management, and water supply. The self‐contained arched BC device demonstrates high evaporation efficiency (84% under 1 sun radiation) and superb stability under strongly acidic, strongly alkaline, and intense light environment conditions. More importantly, the porous BC device can provide stable fresh water production that simultaneously promotes the purification of water via evaporation by heating. Finally, the low cost, environmentally sustainable, mechanically robust, and long‐term stable BC device is a potential opportunity for wastewater treatment and desalination in underdeveloped areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As the world shifts toward renewable energy, the need for an effective energy carrier is pressing. Hydrogen has often been touted as a universal clean energy vector and the fuel of the future. Unfortunately, mass adoption of the hydrogen economy is slow due to a lack of incentives and technical difficulties in storing hydrogen. Better materials capable of reversible hydrogen uptake/release with hydrogen capacity surpassing 5 mass% at the ambient must emerge. So far, finding such materials has been elusive; alloys capable of ambient hydrogen uptake/release have a low storage capacity while high capacity hydrides have a very high hydrogen release temperature. From metal alloys to complex hydrides, a better understanding of the behavior of hydrogen in hydrides is essential to fine‐tune their properties toward application. Herein, the latest approaches to design hydrogen storage materials based on known hydrides are reviewed with the aim to facilitate the emergence of alternative thinking toward the design of better hydrogen storage materials. Synthetic methods and conceptual approaches to achieve particular hydrogen thermodynamics and kinetics are discussed. These include metallurgical alloying, mechanochemical modification, chemical destabilization, the nanosizing approach, and theoretical modeling and machine learning techniques to guide experimental work.",

However, the efficiency of current photocatalytic materials is still unsatisfactory. In this work, a robust S‐scheme heterojunction composed of 3D ZnO hollow spheres wrapped by 2D g‐C 3 N 4 layers is fabricated. The electrostatic attraction between both components not only facilitates the exfoliation of g‐C 3 N 4 layers but also strengthens the photocatalyst framework. The prepared g‐C 3 N 4 /ZnO photocatalyst afforded an enhanced CH 4 production rate, which is ≈40 and 7 times higher than those of pure ZnO and g‐C 3 N 4 , respectively. The improved activity is attributed to the extended light absorption and suppressed charge carrier recombination. Moreover, apart from traditional techniques, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is used to probe charge movement in the fabricated S‐scheme heterojunction. An observable shift of the relevant EPR peak is noticed after the construction of g‐C 3 N 4 /ZnO heterostructure, indicating the electron transfer process. This study sheds light on S‐scheme heterojunctions as efficient candidates for CO 2 photocatalytic conversion.",

In this review, the recently reported solar evaporators using metal oxide semiconductors as the photoabsorber material are investigated, from the perspective of nanostructure, synthesis method, and installation method. A timeline sequence map is generated with the CiteSpace analysis tool to visualize the trend of metal oxide semiconductors as photoabsorbers. The nanostructure of metal oxide semiconductor is emphasized, due to its significant effect on regulating photothermal efficiency in solar steam generation. In addition, other considerations are suggested to enable a fair evaluation of future synthesized photoabsorbers, including cost, stability, reproducibility, recyclability, and regenerative ability. A brief summary of divergent application of solar steam generation is conducted to show the merits of solar steam generation, as well to provide insights for production of photoabsorbers targeted to varying usage and scenarios. Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities of metal oxide solar steam generation system are elaborated from the viewpoint of the authors, with the aim to provide useful insights for future development of photothermal solar steam generation.",

However, scaling‐up applications present sustainability concerns, as animal proteins are the main sources for fabricating amyloid fibrils. Plant‐protein‐based amyloid fibrils, a more sustainable alternative to animal proteins, are attracting increasing interests as building blocks in functional materials. Herein, 11 different sources from a wide range of plants are evaluated, and a comprehensive analysis of seven species of plant proteins, including kidney bean, black bean, cowpea, mung bean, chickpea, lentil, and pumpkin seed, with an excellent ability to form fibrils, is presented. A universal strategy for a diversity of plant protein extraction and fibrillization is applied. Flexible fibrils with a persistence length of ≈100 nm and rigid fibrils of several micrometers are discovered in 7S/8S and 11S subunits dominated protein, respectively. Structural evolution toward the β‐sheet content on these proteinaceous assemblies is characterized by thioflavin T (ThT) intensity, circular dichroism (CD) spectra, attenuated total reflectance‐Fourier transform infrared (ATR‐FTIR) spectra, and typical wide angle X‐ray scattering (WAXS) spectra. Finally, their multifunctional applications are further explored and proven that these sustainable protein amyloids demonstrate excellent performance in renewable and degradable bioplastics, and in water purification membranes for heavy metal removal.",

The synergistic effect of zinc ions and cobalt ions enriches the redox‐active sites, which provides favorable conditions for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The synergistic effect of bimetallic ions as the main driving force for the accelerated hydrogen precipitation reaction is analyzed by fluorescence and electrochemical characterization. The results of hydrogen production experiments show that the hydrogen evolution amount of ZnCo 2 S 4 /CdS is about 10 times that of single CdS. In addition, the cyclic hydrogen production experiment and the structural characterization of the catalyst after hydrogen production proves that the catalyst has good stability. Last but not least, the apparent quantum efficiency of the composite catalyst with the best hydrogen evolution activity can reach 17.96%.

These materials should be attributed to their optical and electrical properties and act as multifunctional surfaces in energy production, fuel generation, environmental remediation, sensing, etc. When SCs combine with noble, non‐noble metal, metal oxide, and some carbon‐based materials, they explore wide applications in various fields.

This study contributes to the development of sustainable, non‐emitting asphalt by providing a detailed understanding of the diffusion and adsorption behaviors of hazardous organic compounds (HOCs) emitted from asphalt. Using molecular simulations and quantum analysis, it is investigated how the diffusion and adsorption characteristics of sulfur‐ and oxygen‐containing HOCs change as aging progresses in asphalt. The results show that oxidation reduces the diffusion rate of HOCs and increases their adsorption energy. Dispersion forces and electrostatic attractions are key mechanisms stabilizing HOCs within the asphalt matrix. As oxidation progresses, hydrogen bonding and polar interactions between asphaltenes and highly polar HOCs become dominant. Among the asphalt components, asphaltenes, followed by resins, have the most significant impact on HOC binding. Additionally, non‐aromatic HOCs exhibit higher diffusion rates than aromatic HOCs. These findings provide crucial insights into the emission mechanisms of asphalt over its service life and offer guidance for designing future, sustainable, emission‐free asphalts. By reducing harmful emissions, this research contributes to pollution control, improved air quality, and the broader goal of sustainable pavement development.",

Strategies such as optimizing material selection, modifying surface morphology, and engineering interfacial structures have been explored to enhance TENG performance. However, the role of semiconductor metal oxides in TENG applications remains relatively underexplored. In this manuscript, the role of titanium dioxide (TiO₂), particularly its rutile and anatase phases, in improving the output performance of TENGs is investigated. The fabricated TiO₂‐based TENGs are systematically analyzed, revealing that rutile‐phase TiO₂ demonstrated superior performance compared to anatase, with a 1.25‐fold increase in voltage and a 1.16‐fold increase in current. This enhancement is attributed to rutile's higher dielectric constant, improved charge mobility, and optimized surface morphology. The optimized TiO₂‐based TENG achieved impressive performance metrics, including a voltage output of 500 V, a current output of 140 µA, and a power density of 8.16 W m − 2 , making it highly suitable for self‐powered applications.

While its effect on treated effluent quality is indeed positive, studies on its overall environmental profitability generally disregard the fact that photocatalytic materials may themselves generate pollution in their production, use, and end‐of‐life phases. This work addresses two distinct methods for titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) photocatalytic coatings preparation, that is, chemical –sol–gel, associated with spray coating– and electrochemical –anodic oxidation, which generates the oxide directly from a titanium substrate. Oxides are tested in the photocatalytic decomposition of tetracycline, an antibiotic commonly found in water. Both distilled and tap water are used as matrices. Coatings are tested multiple times to simulate real operating conditions, until photocatalytic activity is compromised. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is then used to quantify and compare the potential environmental impacts associated with the two different TiO 2 production strategies. Eventually, the assessment is completed by considering full photocatalyst regeneration: while for Sol–Gel this only implies cleaning and re‐deposition, anodizing required oxide detachment, and subsequent re‐anodization. The process of oxide removal and re‐anodizing, although invasive and titanium consuming, is repeated 20 times without significant loss of photocatalytic efficiency, indicating robustness and suitability for technology transfer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The climate math is clear: carbon capture and storage (CCUS) is an essential climate mitigation technology, without which achieving net‐zero emission targets will be virtually impossible. This requires periodic assessment and continuous improvement of the technology from various perspectives. This short review highlights the current state of CCUS deployment, recent achievements, and associated challenges. CCUS project pipeline is at an all‐time high in terms of both the number of facilities and carbon dioxide capture capacity. Currently, 47 operational CCUS projects have an annual CO 2 capture capacity of 50.5 Mt CO 2 /year. The total project pipeline capacity is expected to reach 600 Mt CO 2 /year. The natural gas sector is the major contributor, accounting for more than 65% of the total carbon capture capacity. While significant progress is made in recent years, particularly in North America and Europe, CCUS deployment faces several significant challenges that are multifaceted, encompassing technical, economic, regulatory, and social dimensions. Policymakers, industry leaders, investors, and the general public are increasingly feeling the urgency to address climate change, accelerating many mitigation efforts, including CCUS deployment, in leading regions globally. However, to meet climate change mitigation targets, global investment in CCUS deployment must grow even faster this decade.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation has evolved as potential sustainable technique for producing ammonia in contrast to Haber‐Bosch (HB) process. In this process, semiconductor‐based materials are utilized in the presence of light and water, thereby making it less energy‐intensive and more eco‐friendly. However, photocatalytic materials utilized in nitrogen fixation have several disadvantages, including limited chemisorption and activation of nitrogen, low light absorption, rapid charge recombination, and sluggish kinetics. To overcome these issues, design of the catalyst and tailoring of active surface sites are vital so that enhanced performance can be achieved. Also, there is debate about the correct determination of ammonia due to interference by nitrogenous impurities. Taking all these factors into consideration, this review examines the recent reports on enhanced photocatalytic performance of defects modified (vacancy and doping), facet‐engineered, and heterojunction‐based catalysts for nitrogen fixation. The different ammonia quantification techniques like Nessler's reagent, indophenol method, ion chromatography (IC), etc. have been discussed in detail along with issues associated with them. Finally, the existing challenges and outlook of this emerging technology are presented. It is expected that this review will assist the researchers in understanding the current state of this field and effectively implementing it to pave the way for future advancements.",

Inexpensive and sustainable sorbents are needed to mitigate the ecological harm of this pollution. To address this need, this study features a low‐density polysulfide polymer that is prepared by the direct reaction of sulfur and used cooking oils. Because both sulfur and cooking oils are hydrophobic, the polymer has an affinity for hydrocarbons such as crude oil and diesel fuel and can rapidly remove them from seawater. Through simple mechanical compression, the oil can be recovered and the polymer can be reused in oil spill remediation. The polysulfide is unique because it is prepared entirely from repurposed waste: sulfur is a by‐product of the petroleum industry and used cooking oil can be used as a comonomer. In this way, sulfur waste from the oil industry is used to make an effective sorbent for combatting pollution from that same sector.",

On the brink of an energy voracious future, convergence of scientific efforts over efficient and low‐cost energy production and storage would be advantageous and beneficial. The research hovering around sodium‐ion rechargeable batteries (SIBs), a more sustainable alternative to LIBs, has been observing a positive momentum for ten years now, and chemically stable and electrochemically performing anode and cathode materials represent important milestones on the path toward a commercial full‐cell. Material science breakthroughs achieved in carbon and graphite based matrices, layered and open framework structures, and sodium storing alloys, disclose new full‐cell set up opportunities going beyond traditional “rocking chair” configuration. In this contribution an in‐depth analysis of chemical and physical principles lying beyond the energy storage provided by SIBs most recently investigated active materials is given. In the second half of the review, challenges, opportunities, and state‐of‐the art description of full‐cell SIBs lab scale prototypes are discussed. The latter, indeed, stands for a technological validation of a low‐cost alternative to lithium‐ion batteries guaranteeing energy densities close to 150 Wh kg −1 .",

    "abstract": "Abstract As electrocatalysts and electrolyzer designs for CO 2 reduction continue to improve in terms of current density and product selectivity, product crossover from the cathode to the anode is a loss mechanism that is relatively unexplored. The crossover rates of formate, methanol, and ethanol, which are desirable CO 2 reduction products, are compared in electrolyzers containing anion‐exchange membranes and bipolar membranes. The crossover of formate, an anionic CO 2 reduction product, occurs by electromigration through anion‐exchange membranes, and its rate increases linearly with current density. Crossover of electroneutral methanol or ethanol through anion‐exchange membranes occurs to a lesser extent through both diffusion and electroosmotic drag, the latter increasing with current density in anion‐exchange membranes. In contrast, the outward fluxes of protons and hydroxide ions generated in bipolar membranes inhibit the crossover of both anionic and neutral products, even with membranes that contain high surface area junctions. Calculated electroosmotic drag coefficients for each of the neutral products confirm the better performance of bipolar membranes in terms of product losses.",

Finally, the concept of energy‐efficient multifunctional smart windows is addressed in which the smart windows are powered by sustainable energy in daytime, while the windows dynamically control the solar radiation into the building through transmittance modulation, enabling adjustable occupant's privacy. Sustainable energy can be stored in the smart windows during daytime and can be discharged to power other electronic devices at night.

    "abstract": "Abstract To address energy and environmental problems, innumerable titanium dioxide (TiO 2 )‐based photocatalysts have been reported over the last four decades. TiO 2 has attracted immense interest because it is low‐cost, abundant, and photoresponsive. Sunlight‐driven fuel production is one of the ideal photocatalytic approaches in terms of economics and the environment. However, performance issues with TiO 2 photocatalysts remain, including insufficient charge separation due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, and poor utilization of light, because of the material's wide bandgap. To be economically efficient, TiO 2 photocatalysts responsive to visible light are essential. Many researchers have investigated effective modification methods for this purpose. Numerous studies have focused on enhancing photocatalytic activity by modifying TiO 2 . Methods include combining TiO 2 with noble metals, incorporating metals or nonmetals, and introducing vacancies by chemical and physical methods. In addition, many studies have also been conducted to comprehensively determine the underlying reaction mechanisms, and thus guide future research directions. This Review aims to understand the basic principles of photolysis, to summarize recent research trends, to envision future research directions, and to help the development of a new type of TiO 2 ‐based photocatalysts for enhanced solar energy conversion efficiency.",

In response, herein, as a proof‐of‐concept experiment, this study first in situ couples element abundant FeM (M = Ni, Co) particles with the nitrogen‐doped porous carbon (NPC) by a facile and scalable strategy. Unexpectedly, the resulted FeM/NPC exhibits superior trifunctional catalytic activities for HER, OER, and ORR even in the same electrolyte, which can be attributed to the synergistic advantages of FeM/NPC in terms of its good conductivity, highly porous structure, high Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area, nitrogen doping, and the intimate contact of FeM and NPC. Furthermore, such trifunctional catalyst makes the overall water splitting work at moderate overpotential, and endows the assembled Zn−air battery with a good performance and impressive capacity to self‐power the overall water splitting, demonstrating its feasibility for practical application.",

Nonetheless, its practical application is hindered by the poor TE properties of the pristine PEDOT:PSS and complicated treatment procedures. Enhancing its electrical conductivity is a key step for the improvement of TE properties. Here, a simple method is introduced to enhance the conductivity by adding sulfonic acid into the PEDOT:PSS solution. A systematic study of representative sulfonic acids with various functional groups suggests that steric effect induced by the functional groups has remarkable impact on the conductivity. The highest conductivity of 1996 S cm −1 is observed in benzenesulfonic acid‐doped PEDOT:PSS films. The doped PEDOT:PSS films are further treated with dimethyl sulfoxide and hydrazine successively or synchronously to tune the oxidation level. A maximum power factor (PF) of 203.1 µW m −1 K −2 is obtained. The high PF of treated PEDOT:PSS allows the realization of a flexible thermoelectric generator, which can generate 4.6 mV thermovoltage when attached on human skin. It also shows a good linear response with the increase of temperature difference; thus, it can be potentially used as a flexible thermal sensor. The facile fabrication process and good TE performance provide PEDOT:PSS an opportunity in wearable electronics.",

The polar functional groups of KWs facilitate a homogeneous Li-ion distribution and smooth Li redeposition. Therefore, placing a sheet of KWs on the top of a Li anode significantly improves the reversibility of Li anode. The metallic lithium (Li) anode has long been considered as the \"Holy Grail\" for establishing high-energy-density Li-metal based batteries (LMBs), such as Li-sulfur and Li-air batteries.1-6 The Li anode exhibits a high theoretical specific capacity of 3860 mA h g−1, the highest electrochemical reduction potential of −3.040 V (vs standard hydrogen electrode), and a low density of 0.59 g cm−3.3, 4 Nevertheless, the practical use of Li-metal anode suffers from an inherent challenge: the outgrowth of Li dendrites.1, 7 The Li dendrites are branched (or tree-like) Li deposits mainly arising from the highly nonuniform Li-ion redeposition on the electrode surface (Figure 1a).2-4, 8 The imperfect electrode surfaces (e.g., the Cu and Li electrodes shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information) with evident protrusions intensify the inhomogeneous Li-ion distribution due to the higher electric potential around these tips, which is named the \"tip effect.\"2, 4 The aggravated inhomogeneous Li-ion accumulation renders Li ions nonuniformly electrodeposit onto the electrode surface, producing an uneven Li deposit along with the germination of tree-like Li dendrites. The Li-dendrite sprouts and the nonuniform Li deposit cause the \"self-amplification effect\" that magnifies the inhomogeneity of Li-ion distribution and then promotes the outgrowth of Li deposits.2-4 Li dendrites protruding outward from the electrode surface could pierce through the polymeric separator, causing an internal short-circuit and even safety concerns.1, 3, 4 Additionally, the rough Li deposits with Li dendrites enlarge the surface area. The increased reactive surface accelerates the consumption of both Li and liquid electrolyte due to the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.3, 9, 10 The accelerated reactions eventually deplete the electrolyte, thereby leading to battery failures. To address the issue of Li-anode instability, many strategies have been developed to inhibit the dendritic growth. Numerous electrolyte additives have been explored to inhibit the growth of Li dendrites by reinforcing the SEI layer on the Li surface. For example, hydrogen fluoride (HF),11 lithium fluoride (LiF),12 lithium nitrate (LiNO3),13 and 2-methylfuran (2Me-F)14 have been explored as additives. Although the electrolyte additives strengthen the SEI layer, the rapid consumption of additives upon cycling undermines their effectiveness in inhibiting the dendritic growth.15 On the other hand, the SEI layer with a lower modulus cannot sustain the huge volume change originating from the Li dendrite growth.2 In addition to these electrolyte additives, the ex situ artificial protections (e.g., tetraethoxysilane (TEOS),16 lithium nitride (Li3N) film,17 and composite coatings18) can also stabilize the Li anode. However, these remedies fail to solve the intrinsic problem leading to Li dendrites, that is, the inhomogeneous Li-ion distribution. In this regard, allowing Li ions to form a homogeneous distribution is the prerequisite for a dendrite-free electrode surface.3, 4 Recently, a smooth distribution of Li ions has been achieved by applying a membrane that has abundant polar functional groups on top of the Li anode, which inhibit the movement of Li ions toward protrusions induced by the tip effect.3, 4 A 3D oxidized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber layer has been reported to immobilize Li ions onto polar functional groups (e.g., OH, CN, CO, and CN) and thereby prevent Li ions from gathering around protrusions, resulting in a smooth Li deposit.3 In another study, Zhang and co-workers used 3D glass fiber cloths with polar functional groups (e.g., SiO, OH, and OB) to facilitate an even distribution of Li ions and then achieve a dendrite-free surface.4 Inspired by this concept, we apply the Kimwipe (KW) paper on the surface of Li electrode to realize a dendrite-free surface and also to improve the reversibility of the Li anode. KWs, which are common laboratory supplies, are composed of a 3D fibrous framework of virgin wood fibers referred to as fresh cellulose fibers directly derived from plants. The cellulose fibers provide KWs with abundant polar functional groups to adhere to Li ions (Figure S2, Supporting Information) and, therefore, provide excellent wettability and impede the aggregation of Li ions around protrusions (Figure 1b).3, 4 As a result, Li ions homogeneously redistribute and then uniformly deposit on the electrode surface. These favorable features create a smooth Li deposit layer. Moreover, the electrically insulating cellulose fibers of KWs also pilot Li growth along fibers, allowing the epitaxial growth of Li onto the former Li layer due to the strong interaction between polar functional groups and Li ions.3, 4 Due to the homogeneous Li-ion distribution, the KWs effectively suppress the outgrowth of Li dendrites and ameliorate the cycling ability of Li anode. The dendrite-suppression behavior of KWs is mainly contributed from the abundant polar functional groups on their cellulose fibers. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum was employed to characterize the polar functional groups on the cellulose fiber of KWs. The building block of KWs is cellulose, linear polymers (poly-d-glucose) (Figure S3a, Supporting Information). The strong peaks at 3336 and 1635 cm−2, and 1056 cm−2 are attributed to, respectively, the stretching vibrations of polar OH groups and the COC stretching in poly-d-glucose chains.19 Unlike the Celgard separators composed of only nonpolar polymers, polypropylene (Figure S3b, Supporting Information), the polar KWs serve as an inhibitor to prevent Li ions from traveling toward the protrusions, where the enhanced electric field occurs. Moreover, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements demonstrate that KWs exhibit a surface area of 3.3 m2 g−1 (Figure S4, Supporting Information) which originates from the dense, layered porous structure consisting of entangled cellulose fibers (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Collectively, the KWs have both abundant polar functional groups and porous structures to improve the uptake of electrolyte, upgrade the electrolyte wettability, and offer a better electrode–electrolyte contact (Figure S6, Supporting Information).3 Therefore, a sheet of polar KWs inserted between the Li anode and the Celgard separator facilitates a homogeneous Li-ion distribution, thus forming a smooth Li deposit. The dendrite-inhibiting capability of KWs was assessed by Li-plating tests. For the purpose of making a clear and fair comparison, no electrolyte additives were used. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 2) demonstrate the morphology of the deposited Li on the Cu foil. Li is plated on the Cu substrate at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 for 3 h. The control cell without the protection of KWs shows the nonuniform Li deposit with huge cracks that are possibly induced by the growth of Li dendrites (Figure 2a).7, 20 Figure 2b,c reveals that clear Li filaments with a diameter of ≈3 µm and a length of ≈20 µm randomly grown inside the cracks. This observation further confirms that the Li dendrites demolish the integrity of Li deposits. In sharp contrast to the unfavorable Li deposition with numerous dendrites, which results from the inhomogeneous Li-ion distribution, the KW-protected surface exhibits a smooth Li deposit without Li dendrites and shows the well-preserved integrity of the Li deposit (Figure 2d–f) at the same Li-plating condition. Moreover, Figure 2e shows that Li uniformly deposits within the cellulose-fiber framework of KWs and occupies the interspaces between the cellulose fibers of KWs. Continuously plating Li at an extremely high current density (100 mA cm−2) also clearly shows delayed internal short-circuits in the protected cell (Figure S7, Supporting Information), indicating the suppressed Li dendritic growth. The dendrite-free morphology and smooth surface in the KW-protected cell provide solid evidence of the homogeneous Li-ion distribution and stabilized Li electrodes. In addition to suppressing the growth of Li dendrites, KWs flatten the preexisting Li dendrites. To demonstrate this, Li filaments were intentionally pre-electrodeposited on the Cu electrode at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 for 3 h (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Subsequently, half of the electrode surface with predeposited Li dendrites remains unprotected as the control surface while the other half is protected by KWs as the experimental surface. The electrodeposition then underwent at the same current density for another 8 h. Figure S9a (Supporting Information) illustrates a clear contrast between the unprotected area and the protected area, evidencing the termination of the outgrowth of Li dendrites. The KW-protected area has relatively smooth surface (Figure S9b, Supporting Information), implying success in restoring the uneven predeposited Li.2 The homogeneous Li-ion redistribution due to the better Li-ion affinity to the polar KWs effectively transforms the rough surface into smooth surface. In contrast, the unprotected surface exhibits the pronounced roughness with Li filaments protruding outward (Figure S9c, Supporting Information). The inexorable dendrite formation is a result of the self-amplified nonuniform Li-ion distribution.2 Therefore, the distinctive surface morphologies in Figure S8 (Supporting Information) indicate that the KWs function as a matrix to interrupt the inhomogeneous accretion of Li ions on the electrode surface. The cross-sectional SEM images of the Li anode offer additional evidence for the suppressed dendrite growth. The Li anode was retrieved from the symmetric cells cycling at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 for 400 h. Figure S10a (Supporting Information) shows the porous structures and Li filaments on the Li anode of the control cell (Li||Li) without the protection with KW. The porous structure with Li dendrites increases the surface roughness and surface area, thereby accelerating the depletion of electrolytes due to the more vigorous reaction between the porous Li deposit and electrolytes during the repeated formation the SEI layer.1, 3, 4 Eventually, the complete depletion of electrolytes in the control cell leads to the cell failure. However, the KW-protected Li anode retrieved from the KW-protected cell (Li|KW||KW|Li) reveals the relatively compact Li deposit without any Li dendrites protruding outward (Figure S10b, Supporting Information). The compact deposition of Li restrains the rapid degradation of Li and electrolytes and, therefore, improves the cycling ability of the Li anode. The compact Li deposit reconfirms that the KWs with the abundant polar functional groups, including OH and COC groups, serve as the Li-ion redistribution layer to inhibit the inhomogeneous accretion of Li ions. Therefore, KWs facilitate the formation of the compact and dendrite-free Li deposit. The symmetric cell examination is a useful tool to investigate the reversibility of Li anode.12 Figure 3a illustrates the cell arrangements: the control cell (Li||Li) uses the bare Li foil as the electrode, while the KW-protected cell employs the Li foil covered with a sheet of KWs on its top as the electrode (Li|KW||KW|Li). The standard electrolyte contained 1.85 m lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate salt (LiCF3SO3) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)/1,3-dioxolane (DOL) cosolvent (volume ratio = 1:1). The symmetric cells with the standard electrolyte assembled with the 2032-type coin cell were cycled at various current densities of 2, 5, and 10 mA cm−2. As cycling proceeds, electrochemical deposition (Li plating) and Li dissolution (Li stripping) continuously undergo in the symmetric cells. The profiles of voltage versus cycling time are presented in Figure 3b–e. The negative potential results from the dissolution of Li, while the positive potential refers to the overpotential during the deposition of Li.7 Albeit the fresh protected cell exhibits a higher impedance (Figure S11, Supporting Information) due to the insulating KW papers, the protected cells completely outperformed the control cells in reversibility and stability. The control cell at a low current density of 2 mA cm−2 shows an increasing voltage polarization with unstable voltage fluctuations in the voltage versus cycling time profile during cycling (Figure 3b). The high volatility in the control cell is attributed to the nonuniform Li deposition with severe dendrite growth resulting from inhomogeneous Li-ion distribution.3 The polarization continuously escalates to the maximum value (≈700 mV) and then the cell fails in its normal operation after 400 h. The cell failure is mainly due to the complete consumption of electrolytes induced by the rapid reactions between porous Li deposits and electrolytes. In comparison, the KW-protected cell shows a stable cycling ability for 1000 h and a low polarization (≈200 mV) at the same current density of 2 mA cm−2 (Figure 3c). In addition, the KW-protected cells show promising reversibility at high current densities of 5 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively, for 1000 and 400 h (Figure 3d,e). At the high current density, the unfavorable dendrite growth is pronounced due to the increase in highly inhomogeneous Li-ion distribution.21 Thus, the superior cyclability of the KW-protected cell implies a homogeneous Li deposit and less consumption of both Li and electrolyte occurring in the cell. The extremely long-cycling span of 1800 h (75 d) at the current density of 5 mA cm−2 is also accomplished by means of the KW-protected cell (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Moreover, the KW-protected cells (Li|KW||KW|Li) outperform the control cell using the standard electrolyte containing the LiNO3 additive (LiNO3-Li||Li) (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The cycling stability of the control cells is significantly improved by using LiNO3 as an electrolyte additive at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 in the initial 1000 h. This is because LiNO3 facilitates the formation of reinforced SEI layer composed of ROCO2Li (R = alkyl groups), LiNxOy, CF3, and LiF, delaying the outgrowth of Li dendrites.3, 4, 13 Unfortunately, although LiNO3 has been reported to improve the cycling performance due to the formation of a high-quality SEI layer, our experimental results evidence that the LiNO3-Li||Li cell fails to survive in extending cycling life to >1000 h. The unfavorable drawback results from two main reasons. First, in view of the SEI layer, the LiNO3 only reinforces the relatively stable SEI layer with insufficient mechanical stability and it cannot stop the growth of Li dendrites. During long-term cell operation, the insufficient mechanical stability of the SEI layer and the unsolved inhomogeneous Li-ion distribution allow the outgrowth of dendritic Li, which devastates the formed SEI layer and the integrity of the Li deposit.15 Second, the protruding Li dendrites continuously react with the electrolyte and consume LiNO3, thereby reducing the effectiveness in suppressing Li dendrites.3 On the contrary, the KW-protected cell exhibits superior cycling performance with stable polarization after operating for 1200 h. The improved reversibility is attributed to the capability of KWs to distribute Li ions homogeneously on the surface rather than sacrificing themselves to produce a stable SEI layer. Therefore, the nonconsumable KWs not only effectively suppress the growth of Li dendrites, but also significantly enhance the reversibility of the Li anode for the extended cycling life. In summary, we utilized a facile method to improve the reversibility of Li anode by applying a sheet of KWs on the top of a Li anode. KWs possessing abundant polar functional groups serve as a media to facilitate a uniform Li-ion distribution on the electrode, avoiding the aggregation of Li ions around the protrusions. As a result, the homogeneous Li-ion distribution allows Li to deposit compactly and smoothly on the electrode surface, suppressing the formation Li dendrites. KWs also render any preexisting Li dendrites to be transformed into a dense and smooth Li layer. In symmetric cell examination, a stable cycling performance at various current densities of 2, 5, and 10 mA cm−2 is well-maintained for a long cycle life in a standard electrolyte (LiCF3SO3/DME-DOL) without any electrolyte additives. The stable cyclability demonstrates the effectiveness of KWs in inhibiting Li dendrites and enhancing the reversibility.

To localize the absorbed solar energy and make the system floatable, a porous floating and thermal‐insulating foam is placed between the water and the aerogel.

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar steam/vapor generation is a promising approach to produce clean water and solve water scarcity and energy shortage issues. Most of steam/vapor generation devices can only be used on surface water from oceans, lakes, or rivers. Groundwater is another essential resource for public water supply. Acquiring clean water directly from groundwater is important, especially for countries and regions that lack surface water. A natural, plant‐inspired solar steam/vapor generation device is developed in this work by coating a thin layer of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the top surface of a tree stump with roots to extract water directly from groundwater. The 3D interconnected channels/pores in the roots and stump enable fast water transportation within the plant. Under sunlight irradiation, the surface‐coated CNT layer can convert solar energy into heat, and the water is continuously supplied to the heat‐localized interfacial layer of the top surface and is evaporated into vapor upon heating. The evaporation efficiency of such steam/vapor evaporation device for extracting water from groundwater is as high as ≈86% under 10 kW m −2 , which approaches the best performance achieved by devices for surface water extraction, providing an attractive method to utilize groundwater.",

In order to optimize the infiltration of AC into LIG porosities, several strategies are tested, both varying the surface wettability of LIG and acting on the impregnation approach. Overall, the best compromise results in the combination of LIG N‐doping by nitric acid incubation with vacuum‐assisted infiltration of an AC‐slurry, allowing a two‐order of magnitude improvement in the specific capacitance up to 20 mF cm −2 in device configuration.",

In addition, the environmental impact of plastics and synthetic fibers are widespread and substantial, as they can stay in the environment for hundreds of years and contribute significantly to global carbon emissions. Natural fibers such as jute can potentially replace synthetic fibers to manufacture environmentally sustainable, biodegradable, and lightweight composites with improved properties, good thermal and acoustic insulation, and a smaller carbon footprint. However, natural jute fiber‐based composites suffer not only from poor mechanical properties but also being inherently electrically insulating, which limits their applications as multifunctional composites. Here multi‐functional and environmentally sustainable smart composites of graphene‐based natural jute fibers with excellent tensile and interfacial properties are reported. The reduced graphene oxide‐based natural jute fiber enhance the Young's modulus of the composites by ≈450%, and tensile strength by ≈183% after physical and chemical treatment. Such high‐performance composites can also be used as multifunctional smart composites, as demonstrated by effective electro‐magnetic interference shielding performance.

Numerous efforts focus on synthesizing hydrogen peroxide, a major industrial chemical and potential fuel, using simple and green methods. Electrochemical synthesis of peroxide is a promising route.

PEDOT electrodes can support continuous generation of high concentrations of peroxide with Faraday efficiency remaining close to 100%. The mechanisms of PEDOT‐catalyzed reduction of O 2 to H 2 O 2 using in situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations, which both corroborate the existence of a chemisorbed reactive intermediate on the polymer chains that kinetically favors the selective reduction reaction to H 2 O 2 , are explored.

Silver‐nanowire‐coated leaf skeletons are used as breathable and flexible electrodes while freeze‐dried rose petals are used as the dielectric layer.

The electrodes display low constant resistance up to curvature of 800 m −1 . The rose petal dielectric layer has a multiscale 3D cell wall microstructure, which compresses elastically when subjected to pressure. The fabricated sensor can respond to pressures ranging from 0.007 to at least 60 kPa, with a maximum sensitivity of ≈0.08 kPa −1 .

Development of green and clean synthetic techniques/procedures to generate nanoporous carbon materials especially derived from inexpensive waste precursors/resources has rejuvenated the chemistry of carbon materials owing to the abundant nature and low cost of these sources and their ability to generate unique surface/porous structures. These nanoporous carbon materials have been heavily explored in multiple sectors such as soil/water remediation, adsorption and separation, catalysis, energy storage/conversion, capture and conversion of carbon dioxide. In this topical review, the recent state‐of‐the‐art research progress achieved in the design and development of waste‐derived advanced functionalized porous carbon materials are summarized. The various lab‐specific approaches and methodologies involved in synthesizing these materials are discussed in detail. In addition, the potential applications of waste‐derived functionalized porous carbons in the fields of environment, energy storage, and conversion applications are highlighted.

However, the fabrication of highly‐efficient photothermal layers, at large‐scale and low‐cost is still a challenge, hindering practical applications. Herein, it is demonstrated that carbonized towel‐gourd sponges (CTGS) are excellent photothermal materials. And a capillarity‐driven interfacial self‐coating method is developed to prepare the super‐hydrophilic CTGS/paper photothermal layer. The SSG device based on the CTGS/paper exhibits a high evaporation rate of 1.53 kg m −2 h −1 with an efficiency of 95.9% under 1 sun irradiation. The high evaporation rate only slightly reduces when confronting the diverse and complex practical SSG conditions, such as seawater and waste water. Moreover, CTGS/paper has the advantages of simple preparation, recyclablability, low‐cost (≈4 $ per m 2 ), high‐efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, which are the important prerequisites for promoting SSG techniques for industrialization and practical applications. In addition, the versatile energy conversion ability of the CTGS/paper is also demonstrated. Assisted by the photothermal effect of CTGS/paper, solar energy is converted to mechanical energy and electricity.",

In addition to comparing the performance obtained for PEDOT‐based systems with those of traditional cells (i.e., assembled with liquid iodine‐based electrolytes and platinum cathodes), the manuscript also offers a brief analysis of costs and sustainability aspects, built up on experimental data found in the literature; this latter is expected to constitute a precious resource to catalyze the attention of the scientific community on relevant and preliminary aspects when figuring out the industrial scalability of newly proposed cell components.",

As such, finding the right material for the bioelectronic interface is challenging. Hydrogels are water swollen porous polymer networks and, similarly to biological systems, hydrogels are wet, soft, and ion conducting. These properties make hydrogels an ideal choice for the bioelectronic interface between electronics and biological systems. This review focuses on polyelectrolyte hydrogels, a class of hydrogels that has fixed charges as part of the polymer network. In order to maintain charge neutrality, these charges attract mobile ions of the opposite charge in the water swollen pores. These mobile ions give the hydrogels selective ionic conductivity. Here, it is discussed brief fundamentals of hydrogels, ionic conduction mechanism and optimization of the conductivity, and applications in bioelectronic sensors and mechanical actuators.",

The related photothermal materials based on 3D biostructures are promising due to their abundance and easy accessibility. Here, it is shown that surface‐carbonized bamboo (SC‐bamboo) as a photothermal material exhibits outstanding ISSG performance due to its multilevel functional biostructures. On a microscopic scale, the bamboo's air‐filled parenchyma cells promote thermal insulation while its vascular bundles ensure rapid water transport. On a macroscopic scale, a unique concave structure at the bamboo nodes concentrates water and heat in a confined region and the air‐filled hollow chambers in bamboo internodes also ensure thermal insulation. These multilevel functional structures of SC‐bamboo result in a solar‐thermal conversion efficiency up to 93.63% ± 1.57% under 1 kW m −2 irradiation, surpassing most biomass‐derived materials ever reported. Considering bamboo's low cost and convenience, this work sheds light on the design and fabrication of readily accessible, multilevel functional structure for efficient photothermal‐conversion devices.",

AZIBs are good candidates for sustainable stationary storage, covering household energy needs or smoothing the intermittency associated with wind and solar energy. In spite of their potential as a sustainable energy storage technology, the study of their environmental repercussions remains unexplored. The environmental impacts associated with the fabrication of AZIBs are quantified using a cradle‐to‐gate life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Six laboratory‐scale battery designs offering high delivered capacity, energy density and operating lifespan are selected. The contribution of different battery components to eighteen environmental impact indicators is shown. An average value of 45.1 kg CO 2 equiv per 1 kWh is obtained considering the metallic Zn anode, the cathode, the separator, the aqueous electrolyte and the electricity required for cell assembly. AZIBs are environmentally competitive with lithium‐ion, lithium‐oxygen, lithium‐sulfur, and sodium‐ion battery technologies and are attractive from a Circular Economy viewpoint given the potential of renewable materials as separators and the high recycling rates of electrodes. The obtained results prove the suitability of zinc ion batteries as a sustainable stationary energy storage solution.",

However, most reported reduction strategies, such as physical adsorption/filtration and chemical‐catalytic degradation are limited by the secondary pollution caused by the desorption of FMPs and inferior degradation performance. Advanced technologies for efficient FMP control remain largely insufficient and underdeveloped. This work reports a Z‐scheme Bi 2 O 3 @N‐TiO 2 heterojunction synthesized by a solvothermal and wet‐impregnation strategy. Bi 2 O 3 @N‐TiO 2 degrades ≈10.23 ± 1.91 wt% of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)‐FMPs (a major FMP existing in the environment) at pH = 9, which is nearly three times higher than that at pH = 7. Experimental results show that the hydrolysis of PET‐FMPs in alkaline media is the main reason for the superior performance. Importantly, the hydrophilic, weight‐average molecular weight and crystallinity of PET‐FMP are the key factors affecting the photocatalytic degradation performance of PET‐FMPs. This study demonstrates an eco‐friendly strategy for remediation of FMP contamination.",

The cationic site in the fluorite lattice consists of five equimolar elements selected from the group of rare‐earth elements including La, Ce, Pr, Eu, and Gd and second‐row transition metals, Y and Zr. The studied HEOs exhibit bandgaps in the range from 1.91 to 3.0 eV and appropriate valence and conduction bands for water splitting. They reveal high photocatalytic activity that is mostly attributed to the accessibility of more photocatalytic active sites, which provide radicals responsible for the azo dye degradation. The materials successfully produce hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting, suggesting the potential of HEOs as new photocatalysts.

    "abstract": "Abstract The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a complex reaction involving many interdependent physicochemical steps. Highly ordered carbon nitride‐based materials, such as Na‐PHI and K‐PHI, display some of the highest activities for H 2 evolution among the carbon nitride‐based materials, due to their electronic properties, but also the presence of cyanimide terminations, which favors the charge transfer for the Pt cocatalyst nanoparticles (NPs). For such highly optimized semiconductor structures, the necessity to control and improve other steps of the photocatalytic process becomes essential, in particular the poor electron transfer from the Pt NPs to the protons in solution over the Helmholtz or Stern layer. Taking highly ordered Na‐PHI as a test material, the influence of water‐dissolved alkali cations on the HER is systematically studied and it is experimentally verified that the electron transfer from the Pt NPs to the protons in solution limits the efficiency of heterogeneous carbon nitride‐based catalysts. This paper explains how hydrated alkali cations influence electron transfer and are able to boost the H 2 evolution rate of the same Na‐PHI from 2401 up to 5330 µmol h −1 g −1 with an apparent quantum yield of 13% at 420 nm.",

To date, several large‐scale industrial DMC synthesis routes have been developed, including methanol phosgenation, transesterification, and oxidative carbonylation of methanol. However, these manufacturing routes have several disadvantages, such as the use of hypertoxic phosgene as raw material, costly processing, and explosion risks. The most encouraging and ecofriendly path is the green production of DMC from CO 2 and methanol. Various catalytic materials have been examined concerning their suitability for DMC synthesis. The issues of low yield and difficulty in tests have not been resolved fundamentally, which is caused by the inherent problems of the synthetic pathway and limitations imposed by thermodynamics. The search for more efficient production routes has driven the activation of CO 2 via electro‐assisted synthesis as well as membrane reactors, which can isolate products in real‐time to maximize DMC yield. The green synthesis of dimethyl carbonate catalyzed by different catalysts including Zr/Ce/Cu‐based nanocomposites, organometallic compounds, heteropoly acid, ionic liquid, metal‐organic frameworks, etc, is discussed in detail. Further, the structure–activity relationships and insights into molecular activation and catalytic mechanisms, as well as the identification of active sites on catalysts are addressed.",

The formulation of controlled release fertilizers (CRF) to synchronize nutrient release according to the demand of plants has emerged as a viable solution to the current problems associated with the poor nutrient usage efficiency of fertilizers. Yet, the greatest obstacle that still stands in the way of broad use of CRF in agriculture is their expensive manufacturing costs. The first section of this analysis focuses on broad topics related to CRF. Afterward, the differences between several cost‐effective raw materials and some of the production techniques used to make CRF are examined. Furthermore, the emerging field of “smart” coating materials, such as stimuli‐responsive coatings, which can accurately tailor nutrients delivery to the demands of the vegetation, is discussed, and the most important research work that could lead to their extensive use in agriculture is pointed out.

At present, nanomaterials as catalysts of photocatalytic degradation have emerged as attractive and effective materials for wastewater treatment. On the one hand, much work has been focused on the search for nanomaterials with high catalytic activity, such as precious metal nanoparticles (NPs) and other advanced functional materials (e.g. graphene oxide (GO), MXenes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), etc.). On the other hand, modifications of existing photocatalysts to enhance their photocatalytic activity have also been explored. In this paper, photocatalysts in various dimensions (including precious metal nanoparticles, nanofibres, 2D nanosheets such as MXenes, and MOFs) are been described. The deposition of nano photocatalysts by different techniques such as the formation of hydrogel structures to immobilize the catalysts, the treatment of nanocatalysts using electrospinning technique, and the formation of core‐shell structures to enhance catalytic activity are also discussed. These techniques not only solve the aggregation of NPs due to their high surface energy but also impart unique properties to the nano photocatalysts. This review explores the synthesis of nano photocatalysts in different dimensions and their application in the catalytic degradation of dyes and nitro compounds, providing good leads for nano photocatalysts in materials design and environmental remediation.",

Molten salt carbonization and activation (MSCA) is a promising approach to converting biomass to functional biocarbon and reducing or neutralizing carbon impact on the environment. It uses a single thermal treatment and features high‐efficiency conversion, rapid production, and low resource and processing costs. More importantly, in this process, the unmatched purely ionic environment at high temperatures can lead to in situ activation (pore generation) of the biocarbon and introduce desired ions into the carbon to enable unique functionalities. The obtained biocarbon possesses a fairly large specific surface area (SSA), balanced pore structure, and specific surface oxygen‐containing groups for diverse applications. This review explains the fundamental and technological aspects of MSCA of biomass, focusing on the approaches, salt compositions (mixtures), processing conditions, and products. The properties of the obtained biocarbon are analyzed and compared in the context of practical applications. Areas for further investigation are also explored with the hope of this molten salt route becoming optimized and industrialized for a circular economy.",

However, the practical application of LMBs has been hindered by various serious challenges, especially the low cycling stability of lithium anodes due to the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites, unstable solid–electrolyte interphase, and excessive volume change of lithium metal. 3D lithium metal anodes with reduced local current density and alleviated volume expansion can be used to improve the safety performance of LMBs.

Recently, research efforts are devoted to build a H 2 economy; however, the reduced hydrogen volumetric density hinders the effective hydrogen storage. To combat this, material‐based hydrogen storage is an emerging trend that has the potential to meet the ongoing goals of the United States Department of Energy. Herein, a critical review is presented on the state‐of‐the‐art material‐based hydrogen storage where nanostructured engineering and nanotechnology have driven a rapid growth in material design from physical sorbents (carbons, metal‐organic frameworks, and organic polymer frameworks) to chemical sorbents (complex and metal nanohydrides). The research trends in physical sorption include tailoring the textural features of porous materials and enhancing the binding energy strength by inducing hydrogen spill‐over effect and functionalization of surfaces. For chemical hydrogen storage, strategies are presented to ameliorate the sorption kinetics and thermodynamics using reactive hydrides, lightweight composites, and nanoconfinement of hydrides. Considering the long‐term hydrogen storage, the concept of para hydrogen storage is also highlighted. Finally, the challenges and their plausible solutions are discussed to attain a sustainable hydrogen economy, in the near future.",

Filaments utilizing a base of recycled PLA, carbon black (CB) as a conductive filler, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a plasticizer are used to produce aqueous AM symmetric supercapacitor platforms that can reach capacitance values 75 times higher than commercially available conductive PLA filaments. Furthermore, through the rapid prototyping capabilities of AM and GCode modification, it is seen that changing the electrode architecture from solid to a mesh with additional inter‐layer spacing is able to further enhance electrode performance by 3.5 times due to improvements in the surface area, ion accommodating capabilities, and faster ion diffusion. The symmetric full cell device is capable of delivering 7.82 mF cm −2 , 4.82 µWh cm −2, and 433.32 µW cm −2 of capacitance, energy, and power density, respectively.

To solve the EM contamination problem, it is imperative to develop high‐efficiency absorption materials with thin thickness, light weight, strong absorption properties, and broad absorption bands. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a special helical structure and chirality, which will lead to special EM effects and therefore can absorb EM microwaves through magnetic polarization attenuation such as hysteresis loss, domain wall resonance, and aftereffect loss. Moreover, they have the characteristics of light weight, good compatibility, wide absorption frequency band, and high electrical loss angle tangent.

The methods and mechanisms of surface modification of CNT absorber composites and the effects of modification on the absorber properties are summarized in detail.

However, investigations under realistic conditions on pouch cell level are challenging, as it is necessary to implement a scalable preparation method for sheet‐type cathodes with high sulfur utilization and loading. In this study, a solvent‐free process to prepare free‐standing cathode sheets with low binder content down to 0.1 wt% PTFE is demonstrated. The contribution of binder and electrolyte on the conversion reaction of sulfur is discussed. Sheet‐type cathodes reach nearly theoretical sulfur utilization of 1672 mAh g S −1 and outstanding reversible capacity retention with 72% of initial discharge capacity after 400 cycles by adapting cut‐off voltages to the stability window of the electrolyte. Furthermore, an all‐solid‐state pouch cell is demonstrated using the dry‐film cathode, which is successfully tested for 50 cycles at different C‐rates. Thickness monitoring of the cell stack gives fundamental insights into the volume change and breathing behavior of both cathode and anode.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ammonia as a green energy source has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Despite its industrial intensity, the Haber‐Bosch process remains a primary ammonia source, emitting significant CO 2 (≈2.9 tons per ton of ammonia). Future ammonia synthesis methods aim to surpass the Haber‐Bosch process by operating under milder conditions. These methods encompass chemical looping, thermal catalysis, electrochemical catalysis, photocatalysis, and plasma catalysis, albeit with inherent limitations. Although thermal catalysis has reduced conditions to ≈5 MPa, innovative catalysts are still scarce. Electrochemical catalysis produces hydrogen via water electrolysis but encounters challenges in Faraday efficiency and ammonia yield. Photocatalytic synthesis, while energy‐efficient, suffers from sluggish reaction rates. Plasma synthesis, while achieving low temperatures and pressures, faces difficulties in ammonia yield amidst competitive reactions. Chemical looping synthesis, enabling independent nitrogen fixation and hydrogenation, lacks efficient nitrogen transport catalysts. Effective catalysts are a common requirement across these methods. This review explores recent advancements, elucidating reaction mechanisms, nitrogen activation, and catalyst performance, while discussing the strengths, weaknesses, and future prospects of ammonia synthesis technologies to foster further innovation in the field.",

The core technology of photothermal conversion is photothermal materials, biomass photothermal materials are characterized by low cost, large specific surface area, environmental friendliness, and renewability. Discarded tea leaf residue (TLR) is harmful to the environment and has good recycling potential. In this work, a high‐performance, low‐cost, environmentally friendly solar steam generation material is fabricated by combining polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels and biomass photothermal material TLR. TheTLR hydrogel utilizes solar energy as a renewable energy source for desalination. Under 1.0 kW m −2 simulated solar irradiation, the evaporation rate is 1.35 kg m −2 h −1 and the evaporation efficiency is 93.35%. The waste heat generated during solar water evaporation can be effectively used for synergistic water‐electricity cogeneration, thus achieving an evaporation rate and voltage of 0.91 kg m −2 h −1 and 58.8 mV under 1.0 kW m −2 solar irradiation, respectively. The prepared hydrogel can also be used as a good organic dye adsorbent material, which has a broad application prospect in wastewater treatment.

Dyes are widely used in diverse industries, including paper, printing, and textiles, which cause serious environmental problems due to their persistence and toxicity. Unlike traditional catalysts that rely on chemical reactions to drive dye degradation, piezocatalysts offer a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to breaking down complex molecules through creating highly reactive species, which have shown a significant promise in the treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater. In this review, the basic principles of piezocatalysis are first outlined, specifically describing two ubiquitous forms of driving force in nature. Following the catalytic mechanism, the current mainstream piezocatalytic materials are classified into two categories: organic and inorganic materials with detailed discussions. Moreover, after investigating and analyzing previous literature, effective strategies for improving piezocatalytic efficiency for dye degradation are systematically compared and summarized. In the end, current issues that need to be addressed in the future as well as potential research directions related to piezocatalysis are prospected.

Brine commonly has high salinity and TDS (total dissolved ions), which contains ions such as Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Cl − , SO 4 2− , HCO 3 − , PO 4 3− , and some critical elements. Currently, the brine treatment mainly applies direct disposal, like surface water discharge, sewer discharge, deep‐well injection, and evaporation ponds. However, these methods can cause harm to marine ecosystems, soil, and groundwater. Therefore, brine can be regarded as a resource to be reutilized. This work then aims to highlight the novel developments of brine application. For example, Na, Ca, and Mg in brine can be employed for carbon capture and utilization with ammonia, amines, and alkaline substances. With slight adjustment, brine can also be directly used as irrigation water, aquaculture water, and the activation of biochar. Furthermore, brine holds a higher concentration of critical elements, which makes many countries and scholars start to conduct element extraction, reducing the amount of ore exploitation. At last, the major obstacles related to these advancements in sustainability, expenses, and technological aspects are outlined, and promising research trends of brine reutilization are also suggested.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recycling metals from waste materials has become a major approach to metal resource utilization, with electronic waste (e‐waste) and waste catalysts being the most important recycling resources. Although traditional recovery technologies (pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy) have a recovery efficiency of up to 100%, they have disadvantages of high energy consumption, high cost, and strong corrosiveness. Most importantly, they cannot achieve selective leaching. To address these issues, some fusion technologies have been developed. Electrodeposition has significant advantages in separating and purifying each metal, but if applied on a large scale in industry, it requires higher energy consumption. While photocatalytic technology has low energy consumption but low selectivity, hence further exploration is needed. Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have great selectivity for metal ions, which are environmentally friendly and efficient, and a promising new material. Some recently typical recovery methods for six valuable metals, platinum (Pt), gold (Au), silver (Ag), lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co) in e‐waste and industrial catalysts are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of each method as well as their impact on the leaching efficiency and selectivity of different metals are also compared, aiming to provide useful guidance for further continuously advancing the research on efficient, selective, environmentally friendly metal recycling in the future.",

The preparation of CCO/wt%NFO composites result in an estimation of its photocatalysis performance by removing tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) as a model of antibiotic pollutants. The results show that the percentage of NFO by mass have a great influence on the morphology and the photocatalysis performance of CCO/wt%NFO composites. Superior photocatalysis performance is observed in CCO/25%NFO composites prepared at percentage of NFO is 25%. The photocatalyst used with CCO/25%NFO composites result in a removal ratio of 81% for TC. The generation of hydroxyl radical (•OH), superoxide anion radical (•O 2 − ) and holes (h + ) is largely responsible for degrading TC through photocatalysis in the presence of CCO/wt%NFO composites. The optimal operating conditions involve the initial concentration of TC and pH of TC being 50 mg L −1 and pH = 13, respectively. Furthermore, CCO/wt%NFO is highly reusable and stable during the photocatalytic removal process.

The presence of MPs in the aquatic environment is reported to have serious potential environmental and health impacts. Therefore, it is essential to develop efficient and sustainable strategies for the remediation of MPs from the aqueous environment. Traditional techniques for the remediation of MPs from an aqueous environment have limitations, including high costs and the production of secondary pollutants. In this scenario, bioremediation offers several advantages and has emerged as a cost‐effective, eco‐friendly, and efficient strategy for the removal of MPs from water. This article critically reviews the recent progress in the applications of bioremediation for the removal of different MPs from water. The effects of key factors such as the characteristics of MPs, environmental conditions, and types of microorganisms on the removal of MPs are elaborated in detail. The underlying mechanisms involved in the removal of MPs by microorganisms are also discussed comprehensively. Major technological challenges are identified, and recommendations for future research are provided. Despite several challenges, bioremediation is a promising approach that can revolutionize the MP removal process if the major challenges are addressed.",

Photocatalytic hydrogen production, in which sunlight is the sole energy input, has been extensively studied, and requires the creation of photogenerated excitons (through irradiation of semiconductors) and their transport to aqueous media. Chemical scavengers, notably electron donating molecules, are widely used to quench photogenerated holes and thereby suppress exciton recombination which otherwise limits the hydrogen yield. Despite their prevalence, the role and significance of such scavengers (also termed sacrificial agents) in photocatalytic WS remains poorly understood, hindering their rational selection. This review focuses on the importance of electron donors in photocatalytic WS, and their participation in the reaction mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study introduces a two‐step technique for developing nano‐porous, compostable melt‐blown nonwovens with high porosity, specifically engineered for high‐performance particulate capture in air filter applications. The first step entails creating a high melt flow index material by melt‐blending low‐viscosity polylactic acid (PLA) with a sacrificial additive, polyethylene glycol (PEG), of varying molecular weights. Rheological, compatibility, and thermal analyses are conducted on the sample blends. The MFI of the resulting blends ranges from 56 g/10 min (baseline PLA) to 238 g/10 min (PLA/PEG 400–10%), confirming their suitability for the melt‐blowing process. These blends are then formed into nonwoven mats using a twin‐screw extruder, producing microfibers with diameters between 1.05 and 2.64 µm. The second step involves boiling water etching to remove PEG, creating nanopores within the fibers. This etching process leaves a network of nanopores (50–200 nm in size), distributed throughout the microfiber structure. The PLA/PEG 2000 sample exhibits optimal properties, achieving ≈72% particulate capture efficiency for 0.3 µm NaCl particulates during air filtration testing. This study represents an innovative and eco‐friendly approach for creating nano‐porous nonwoven mats with potential applications in air filtration, water filtration, and battery separators, where high porosity is beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, requires efficient large‐scale energy storage systems. Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered attention for grid‐scale applications due to their cost‐effectiveness and long cycle life. Among various cathode materials, layered oxides stand out for their tunable Na content, environmental compatibility, and safety. However, their practical deployment faces challenges, including structural instability caused by phase transitions, Na + /vacancy ordering, and surface degradation, leading to capacity decay. To address these issues, doping and coating strategies are extensively explored to enhance structural stability, improve Na + diffusion, and mitigate electrode‐electrolyte side reactions. This review critically analyzes recent advancements in these modification approaches, revealing their underlying mechanisms and their effects on electrochemical performance. Additionally, emerging strategies, such as multi‐element synergistic doping and doping‐coating dual engineering, are highlighted for further optimizing electrochemical properties. These insights provide a foundation for the rational design of next‐generation layered oxide cathodes, accelerating the commercialization of SIBs for sustainable energy storage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polyurethane foams (PUFs) represent a significant segment of the polyurethane (PU) and cellular plastics industries, owing to their versatile applications and desirable properties. However, the production of PUFs heavily relies on petroleum‐derived chemicals, including polyols and isocyanates, raising critical environmental concerns. Lignin, an abundant aromatic macromolecule, offers a promising alternative for replacing petroleum‐based polyols because of its intrinsic hydroxyl groups. While efforts have been made to produce and apply various lignin‐based polyurethane foams (LPUFs), their commercialization remains limited by challenges such as low product consistency, poor technical performances, and high production costs. This study critically evaluates recent advances in the development of LPUFs, including innovative synthesis methods, functional applications, and emerging research trends. Moreover, potential strategies are discussed, such as lignin fractionation, modification, and co‐solvent assistance, for addressing the challenges. By resolving them, LPUFs could play a pivotal role in transitioning the PU industry to help achieve a circular bioeconomy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The unmatched applications of plastic commodities are evident from the enormous plastic production, reaching over 400 million tons per year in recent times. Contrastingly, the lack of proper management leads to a large accumulation of plastic waste, majorly including polyolefins and polyesters. Conventional management methods possess significant drawbacks like cost‐ineffectiveness and greenhouse gas emissions. Over the last decade, chemical processes have shown promising potential for plastic management but only hold a 0.1% share in plastic recycling. The catalytic processes offer excellent protocols to obtain high‐value liquid fuels, waxes, and chemicals from plastic waste. This review presents an elaborate discussion on the state of the art in the reductive upcycling of polyolefins, polyesters, and mixed plastic waste. The review initially discusses the alarming statistics of plastics and conventional approaches followed by an introduction to chemical processes. Further, various recently reported catalytic upcycling strategies have been elaborated in detail followed by catalyst deactivation, technoeconomic analysis, and life cycle assessment to obtain a deeper understanding of the current state of this research field. Finally, a detailed summary of the current state of plastic management along with the existing challenges and countermeasures is discussed to open new avenues in plastic waste management research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Greenhouse agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels for indoor lighting, resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy, offers a sustainable solution. Solar energy, being clean and reliable, is ideal for agricultural greenhouses, reducing their dependency on conventional energy sources and lowering emissions. Recent studies have highlighted effective solar technologies for greenhouse integration. This article reviews the role of luminescent materials like quantum dots in optimizing light management. Quantum dots enhance solar energy absorption by converting ultraviolet radiation into visible photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), improving plant photosynthesis and growth conditions in controlled environments. Advancements in solar greenhouses focus on integrating technologies such as light‐to‐light conversion and photovoltaic (PV) systems. Quantum dots, as inorganic semiconductors, are particularly effective in greenhouse covers, converting high‐energy UV radiation into PAR and boosting productivity. Traditional PV modules on greenhouse structures can cause shading, negatively impacting crop growth. However, using bifacial PV modules based on Quantum dots, such as Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs), can enhance PAR inside greenhouses while capturing light at the edges to generate electricity for internal use, mitigating shading issues and enhancing efficiency.",

Of these nanostructured iron oxides, especially Fe 2 O 3, forms one of the most preferred choices of material as supercapacitor anode due to low cost, non‐toxicity, high abundance and availability of variable oxidation states. In this study, the synthesis of nanostructured Fe 2 O 3 nanocubes is presented via the hydrothermal method using a mixed solvent system. The annealed α‐Fe 2 O 3 nanocubes show a superior specific capacitance of 908 F g −1 as compared to 796 F g −1 for the as prepared samples at a current density of 2A g −1 , The high specific capacity of Fe 2 O 3 nanocubes can be ascribed to the availability and exposure of active sites for charge storage, low charge transfer resistance (Rct) and reversible electrochemical reactions involving Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ ions. Further, the assembled two‐electrode asymmetric device α‐Fe 2 O 3 //NiO shows the energy density of 25.31Wh Kg −1 at a power density of 759.3 W Kg −1 , with capacitance retention of 70% after 1000 cycles.

MoS 2 ‐Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits low overpotentials of only 187 and 146 mV for OER and HER, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in 1 M KOH. The practical application of the designed bifunctional electrocatalyst is verified by constructing the MoS 2 ‐Ni 3 S 2 /NF || MoS 2 ‐Ni 3 S 2 /NF symmetrical membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of 4 cm 2 working area for the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer.

HEA is synthesized through mechanical alloying, followed by HEO forming via an oxidation process. XRD results demonstrate HEA comprises both amorphous and crystalline phases, whereas HEO has an entirely crystalline structure. SEM analyses showed HEA exhibits larger and irregular particles, whereas HEO displays a smaller and spherical morphology. EPR analyses revealed significant changes in defect structures and unpaired electron configurations during the transition from HEA to HEO. HEA is prone to diffusion‐controlled processes due to their regular structure and strong magnetic interactions; however, HEO exhibits capacitive behavior based on surface redox reactions and pseudo‐capacitive mechanisms due to their irregular structure and oxygen vacancies. CV analyses revealed that HEO contributes more capacitive via surface redox reactions, while GCPL results suggested that HEO demonstrated superior energy density (40.8 Wh kg −1 ) and power density (14.3 kW kg −1 ). Impedance analyses revealed that HEO exhibited reduced internal resistance and enhanced ion conductivity, whereas HEA demonstrated higher resistance and diffusion‐controlled processes. In conclusion, HEA and HEO exhibit distinct energy storage mechanisms, and these materials can be optimized for supercapacitor applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Much effort is being directed at developing wearable devices because they offer the potential combination of real‐time personal communication and convenient portability. In this sense, communicative textiles that can sense and respond to changes in their environment, that is, smart textiles, are attracting attention because they are easy to integrate into the human body. In particular, light‐emitting textiles are preferred for high‐visibility outfits for personal safety and attractive signaling that enable mutual recognition or new forms of communication. However, most light‐emitting textiles, including weavable optical fibers and fiber‐shaped electroluminescent devices, require electric power supply. This paper presents a mechanoluminescent fiber that is capable of emitting light and can potentially be powered just by human motions, such as body movement and muscle stretching, instead of a battery. This is achieved by utilizing a robust mechanoluminescent (ML) fiber developed by improving the binding of mechanoluminescent ZnS‐embedded‐polydimethylsiloxane with a primer‐treated cross‐shaped fiber frame and employing an adhesive layer. A novel ML fabric, created by weaving ML fibers, is also presented, which is applicable to wearable light‐emitting fabrics. Battery‐free, human motion‐powered ML fiber is expected to make environmentally friendly and sustainable light, and further paves the way for new wearable devices that reduce energy waste.",

This market demand necessitates research on flexible LIBs to fulfill the energy requirements of these devices. One of the main areas of research of flexible LIBs is the active and inactive materials used in manufacturing these batteries. Active materials are those used in the battery electrodes to store lithium in their structure. The remaining materials in flexible LIBs, which do not directly contribute to energy storage, are inactive materials. Inactive materials and components—including electrode conductive materials, binders, separator, current collectors, electrolyte, and casing/packaging—make up almost 60% of the total weight of a LIB. Thus, they are important in the determination of energy and power density of flexible LIBs. This study reviews the inactive materials and components of flexible LIBs from two aspects. First, inactive materials and components used in flexible LIBs and their properties are compared. Then, the compatibility and stability of inactive materials and components are discussed.

In this manuscript, a facile and general strategy named chemical vapor deposition polymerization (CVDP) to deposit dark PPy coating layer onto various substrates, which acts as a light absorber to efficiently harvest and convert light to heat for solar‐driven interfacial water evaporation, is reported.

Furthermore, the water evaporation can be accelerated to 1.41 kg m −2 h −1 , corresponding to 81.9% on solar conversion efficiency which is comparable to the results of the state‐of‐the‐art photothermal membranes. Due to the moderate reaction conditions, the PPy coating layer can also be deposited onto different porous substrates to meet different water environments.

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants is enticing for addressing challenging, nontraditional water sources. A novel nitrogen-doping method is utilized to grow conformal titania coatings with visible-light activity on porous membranes. The resulting membranes exhibit effective degradation of model organic species in simulated sunlight while at the same time requiring substantially lower transmembrane pressure than undoped membranes. Porous membrane materials offer a wide range of applications including water treatment, energy production and conversion, environmental remediation, pharmaceutics, and biotechnology.1 Reflecting their societal impact, annual global demand for membranes is expected to reach $26.3 billion by 2019.2 As such, vast efforts are directed toward investigating next-generation membrane materials that offer improved functionality and performance.3 Here we show a facile, reliable vapor-phase synthesis method for the fabrication of conformal thin films of nitrogen-doped TiO2 on membranes via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This novel means to introduce nitrogen doping into the TiO2 has the effect of shifting the optical absorption onset from the UV range into the visible. Such doping enables the use of lower energy light, including sunlight, to activate the photocatalytic function of the membrane. Our approach offers compatibility with virtually any porous inorganic membrane and allows for uniform, conformal control of materials exclusively on the surface of the substrates—including internal surfaces of porous substrates—and atomic-level thickness control and pore-size tuning. Ceramic membranes exhibit burgeoning activity because they offer relative thermal, chemical, and mechanical robustness.1 Typical techniques to fabricate ceramic membranes include chemical vapor deposition, solid state sintering, and sol–gel processing.4 Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most widely studied materials in this class due to its photocatalytic ability as an additional function to the membrane system.5 The conventional deposition technique to modify and functionalize membranes with TiO2 is solution-based sol–gel synthesis via dip coating, which typically results in inhomogeneous deposition, pore clogging, and inconsistent membrane production. ALD, which has been predominately used in the field of microelectronics, offers uniformity and conformality with precise tunability of deposition layer thickness.6 The intrinsic optical band gap of TiO2 is 3.2 eV (for anatase crystalline phase), thereby necessitating UV light to drive its photocatalytic function.7 This increases costs and limits practical use, especially in developing world scenarios. Visible-light-active photocatalytic activity of TiO2 can be achieved through metal (e.g., Fe, Cr, Co, Mn, V, or Mo) or nonmetal (e.g., N, F, S, B, or various carbon materials) doping, and codoping, with nitrogen being one of the most promising dopants due to its comparable atomic size with oxygen, small ionization energy, and high stability.8 Despite recent progress in various routes for fabrication of N–TiO2 in a thin-film form (e.g., chemical vapor deposition, sol–gel methods, pulsed laser deposition, ALD, and magnetron sputtering),9 effective utilization of N–TiO2 in membrane technology remains elusive. Thus far, solution-based N–TiO2 nanoparticles have been applied for membrane materials.10 A better, controllable deposition technique is needed to tune pore structure, interfacial chemistry, and physical properties of the membranes without sacrificing permeability. Here we demonstrate for the first time direct, controlled, conformal deposition of N–TiO2 onto membrane substrates via ALD. We used two qualitatively different membrane pore morphologies (i.e., tortuous pore network and cylindrical pores, see the details in the \"Experimental Section\"). Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of the method where self-limited surface reactions between TiCl4 and NH4OH result in a uniform conformal deposition of N–TiO2 on a porous matrix. One cycle of ALD consists of four steps: (1) TiCl4 vapor is pulsed and forms a monolayer of chemisorbed TiClx species on the surfaces of the porous membrane; (2) unreacted TiCl4 and HCl byproducts are purged out by nitrogen; (3) the next precursor, NH4OH, is subsequently pulsed yielding a mixture of gaseous H2O and NH3 which react with the chemisorbed TiClx species yielding a monolayer of N–TiO2; and (4) unreacted precursor and HCl byproducts are again purged out by nitrogen. This cycle is repeated to achieve the N–TiO2 target thickness. Figure 2a shows optical absorption spectra of N–TiO2 and TiO2 membranes. A TiO2 membrane fabricated using TiCl4 and water as precursors is used as a control system. Difference in the absorption edges of TiO2 and N–TiO2 in the visible range from 400 to 500 nm is evident and consistent with the calculated imaginary parts of the dielectric functions of N–TiO2 and previous experimental results.11, 12 This shift of the absorption edge is due to dominant transitions corresponding to N2pπ to Tidxy, instead of from O2pπ as in undoped TiO2. The effect of N-doping resulted in a vivid color change of the membrane from white to yellow as shown in the inset of Figure 2a. To better understand the N–TiO2 ALD process on the porous membranes, we prepared ALD films with thicknesses of ≈60 nm at different temperatures ranging from 250 to 450 °C. The corresponding absorption spectra for these materials are shown in Figure 2b. These data reveal that the absorption edge shifts into the desired visible range (400–500 nm) when the deposition temperature was 375 °C and above. Small changes in absorption intensities among samples prepared above 375 °C may be due to slight thickness variations. No significant change in absorption occurred when the deposition temperatures were between 250 and 350 °C. TiO2 deposition without any doping at the same temperature range also did not result in any absorption shift; the absorption spectrum of a pure TiO2-coated membrane fabricated at 400 °C is shown in Figure 2b for comparison. The free energy changes (∆G, in kJ mol−1 Ti) for these two processes are plotted as a function of temperature in Figure 2c. At temperatures below ≈300 °C, ∆G for the TiN reaction is positive and for TiO2 it is negative, indicating that the ALD films should be pure TiO2 at these deposition temperatures. At temperatures above ≈300 °C, ∆G for the TiN reaction becomes increasingly more negative so that TiN formation becomes more favorable, and this agrees fairly well with the onset of visible absorption in the N–TiO2 at 375 °C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements performed on the membranes revealed exclusively the anatase crystalline phase with no traces of rutile or titanium nitride structures (Figure 2d). Consequently, the ALD N–TiO2-coated membranes do not require postannealing to obtain the desired anatase phase, which is the preferred crystal form for photocatalytic activity due to efficient bulk transport of excitons to the surface, longer charge carrier lifetimes, and low recombination rate of charge carriers on the surface.14 ALD coatings on anodic aluminum oxide cylindrical pore membranes were used for basic material characterization to simplify interpretation, and all membrane performance studies involved membranes having a ZrO2/TiO2 with tortuous pore network as the substrate to mimic realistic conditions. To evaluate the photocatalytic activity of N–TiO2 under visible light illumination, methyl orange (MO) was chosen as a model pollutant15 (MO is an example of an azo dye and is representative of numerous organic pollutants in water bodies). Figure 3a shows a representative absorption profile of an aqueous solution of MO (4 mg L−1) in the presence of an N–TiO2-coated membrane prepared at a temperature of 400 °C at different illumination times. The maximum absorbance at 464 nm, corresponding to an nπ* transition due to substituent perturbation (i.e., addition of (CH3)2N and SO3Na on azobenzene), was used as a proxy for MO concentration.16 The maximum band intensity decreased monotonically as a function of illumination time indicating photodegradation of MO in the presence of the N–TiO2 membrane. No noticeable photocatalytic activity was observed when the N-TiO2 film was absent, as shown in Figure 3b. To understand if there is any correlation between deposition thickness and photocatalytic activity, the number of ALD cycles was varied (Figure 3b). The corresponding N–TiO2 thicknesses for 300, 450, and 600 ALD cycles were 21.08 ± 0.19, 30.73 ± 0.07, and 39.70 ± 0.08 nm, respectively (see the \"Experimental Section\"). Relative concentrations of the MO pollutant (C/C0) in the presence of N–TiO2 membranes with different deposition thickness are 60.2%, 70.0%, and 76.4% for 300, 450, and 600 cycles, respectively, following 100 min of photoexposure. These results show that the population of available photocatalytic surface sites decreases as the number of ALD cycles increases even though there is more active material deposited onto the membranes. Visual porosity analysis can provide some quantification of this phenomenon as shown in Figure 3c. Surface porosity gradually decreases as the number of ALD cycles increases from 9.4% for 300 cycles, 6.2% for 450 cycles, to 1.8% for 600 cycles (see the \"Experimental Section;\" Figures S2–S4, Supporting Information). These results imply that, even though there is more active material deposited on the surface of the membranes to effectively absorb the incident light, flow of solution containing the pollutant is likely inhibited by restrictive pore sizes. Catalytic performance is a complex interplay between light absorption, water/solute flux through the membrane, and population of surface active sites. Changing the N–TiO2 thickness affects each of these parameters simultaneously—including a secondary effect on the number of charge carriers reaching the water/titania interface (as opposed to suffering from recombination) as the films increase in thickness, which hinders deciphering their individual roles. In order to demonstrate the multifunctional capabilities of these functionalized membranes, we examined their filtration performance in addition to their catalytic properties. Figure 4 shows pure water flux of the fabricated membranes as a function of applied transmembrane pressure ranging from 6 to 30 psi (a range selected to remain safely below the rated pressure limit of the commercial substrates). Since the ALD coatings reduce the pore size, one would expect the flux to decrease following the deposition. Surprisingly, the N-coated TiO2 membranes presented substantially higher flux at all tested pressures as compared to a control membrane without the coating. The average pore size of the control membrane is 140 nm, whereas effective pore sizes of N–TiO2-coated membranes are ≈100, 80, and 60 nm for the 300, 450, and 600 ALD cycle membranes, respectively, based on the assumption that the N–TiO2 coating is uniform and conformal in the pores. Specifically, the average permeance of the N–TiO2 membrane by 300 cycles (6.32 × 103 L m−2 h−1 at 1 bar) has almost an order of magnitude increase as compared to the control system (9.78 × 102 L m−2 h−1 at 1 bar). Permeances of N–TiO2 by 450 and 600 cycles are 1.59 × 103 and 2.89 × 102 L m−2 h−1 at 1 bar, respectively. Membrane reliability tests using the control membranes showed that the flux difference from manufacturing variations is significantly smaller than the measured flux differences among processed membranes (see Figure S5, Supporting Information). Also, the control membrane annealed at 420 °C did not show any significant change in the flux performance (Figure S6, Supporting Information). This enhancement of the permeance despite smaller pore sizes may be largely due to augmentation of hydrophilicity. To experimentally probe this hypothesis, TiO2 deposition without N-doping via ALD was carried out based on the same experimental procedures, and the permeance between TiO2 and N–TiO2, both having ≈20 nm deposition thicknesses, was compared (see the \"Experimental Section;\" Figure S7, Supporting Information). Although the deposition thickness is the same, the permeance of the N-doped TiO2 membrane is dramatically higher than the TiO2 membrane (≈500 L m−2 h−1 for TiO2 vs 6000 L m−2 h−1 for N–TiO2 at 1 bar). Moreover, surface wettability studies show that the N-doped TiO2 membrane exhibits enhanced hydrophilicity as compared to the TiO2 membrane (water contact angles for N-doped TiO2 and TiO2 membranes with the same deposition thickness of 20 nm are 22.9° ± 2.52° and 107.4° ± 0.82°, respectively) (see Video S1 Supporting Information), consistent with previous reports by using various fabrication routes.12, 17 Based on these macroscopic studies, we conjecture that nitrogen doping plays a vital role in chemically enhancing hydrophilicity, which facilitates water transport. Future studies will explore the relative role of surface properties including composition, charge, and morphology on the membrane performance. In summary, this study demonstrates a novel means to fabricate nitrogen-doped TiO2 membranes via ALD without any need for postannealing. Conformal and thickness-controllable doping results in a lowered band gap enabling photocatalysis using visible light. N–TiO2 membranes show significantly enhanced permeance and photocatalytic activity for degrading organic pollutants under solar irradiation. The work presented here provides the basis for creating tailored multifunctional inorganic membranes capable of destroying pollutants and self-cleaning under solar irradiation that can be utilized in various applications, most notably in water treatment and purification. Materials Preparation: For the fabrication of TiO2 and N-doped TiO2 (N–TiO2) membranes, Al2O3 with cylindrical pores having 200 nm pore size (Anodisc, Whatman) and ZrO2/TiO2 with tortuous pore network having 140 nm pore size (Sterlitech Corp.) with 47 mm membrane diameters were used as model substrates. Either TiO2 or N–TiO2 was deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) via alternate exposure to TiCl4/water and TiCl4/NH4OH, respectively. The NH4OH (Sigma Aldrich) consisted of a 30% aqueous NH3 solution. At room temperature (21 °C), this solution has a vapor pressure of 17 psi, and composition that is 95% NH3 and 5% H2O. These conditions are well suited for N–TiO2 ALD given the much higher reactivity of H2O compared to NH3 using TiCl4. Compared to previous studies that alternated between TiCl4/NH3 cycles for TiN ALD and TiCl4/H2O cycles for TiO2 ALD to produce a layered N-doping profile, this physical mixture of NH3 and H2O would likely produce a more homogeneous N-doping profile. These membrane materials were prepared in a custom hot-walled viscous flow ALD reactor described elsewhere.18 The growth layer with a desired thickness is controlled based on the temperature, pulse times, and number of process cycles. Briefly, the surface reactions were performed at various temperatures ranging from 250 to 450 °C using nitrogen as a carrier gas at a mass flow rate of 330 sccm and a pressure of 1 Torr. The membrane substrates were placed in the reactor with the long axes of the pores normal to the carrier gas flow. The ALD reactant pulse timing sequence (AB cycle) is given by t1–t2–t3–t4 where t1 is the exposure time for reactant A, t2 is the purge time following the A exposure, t3 is the exposure time for reactant B, and t4 is the purge time following the B exposure. ALD timing sequences (where the units are in second) for TiO2 and N–TiO2 were 0.75–5–0.75–5 and 0.75–5–0.25–5, respectively. Materials' Characterization and Analysis: Absorption measurements were carried out by using a Cary 5000 UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. To determine the crystal structures of TiO2- and N–TiO2-deposited membranes, X-ray diffraction was used (Bruker X-ray System D8 ADVANCE A25). Si wafers as witness pieces were loaded along with the membranes into the ALD chamber during TiO2 and N–TiO2 deposition cycles in order to determine the thickness of the materials via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE, J. A. Woollam, Co. alpha-SE). For the ΔG calculations, the HSC Chemistry program was used (Outotec Research Oy, Espoo, Finland). For investigation of morphology of the fabricated membranes, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded using a JEOL 7500F field emission SEM operating at 10 kV. For surface visual porosity determination, all SEM images were taken at 40 000× magnification operating at 10 kV. The surface visual porosity as a result of different ALD cycles was determined by converting SEM images into binary format, and porosity was calculated using image processing (total number of pixels representing the pores divided by the total number of pixels of the entire image) in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick). To determine the permeance of the fabricated membranes, water flux of the membranes was measured by using a stirred filtration dead-end cell (EMD Millipore), where the flow of water (in-house reverse osmosis water) is perpendicular to the membrane surface. The water was pushed through the membrane by applied transmembrane pressures ranging from 5 to 30 psi. Nitrogen gas line was attached to the cell and was used to maintain the applied pressure gradient (note that nitrogen gas is chosen as compressed air results in pH shifts). A magnetic stirrer was used throughout the experiments to provide a shear force needed to maintain homogeneous aqueous media. The weight of permeate was measured on a digital balance connected to a LabVIEW program to control the setup as well as continuously log the flux at a given applied pressure. For photocatalytic degradation experiments, 50 mL of oxygenated aqueous methyl orange (4 mg L−1) was placed into the dead-end cell. The cell was constructed by placing a membrane at the bottom of the cell, and the top of the cell was covered and completely sealed. A xenon lamp (Perkin Elmer) was used as a light source (≈100 mW cm−2 irradiance) with an IR water filter (Newport). Throughout the experiments, the solutions were stirred at constant speed to ensure homogeneous dispersions. To ensure the accuracy of absorption measurements, methyl orange solution was stirred at least for 1 h in the dark, and absorption spectra were taken to confirm constant optical density (constant O.D. (optical density) should be read after any adsorption/desorption of MO molecules on the surface of membranes) before the illumination. For contact angle measurements, a Dataphysics Contact Angle Measurement OCA Model ES tool was used with a 30 fps camera. Deionized water drops with volumes of 0.6 µL were brought into contact with the membrane surface, and the reported contact angle was the first stable frame after the drop detached from the needle.

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of reliable power sources is important for the continuous operation of various electric equipment in unmanned aircraft and the field environment. Currently electric power delivery to such systems is mainly by battery packs. An alternative is to use fuel cells (FCs). FCs are electrochemical devices that are used to convert chemical energy of fuels such as hydrogen and methanol to electricity. Methanol is an attractive fuel because it is liquid at ambient temperature, has a much higher energy density than hydrogen and low reforming temperature (220–300 °C). Thus, integration of methanol steam reformers (MSRs) with FCs makes it possible to continuously produce electricity. The key challenge in such power system is the development of fuel cells which can be effectively operated at compatible temperature range of MSR, i.e., 220–300 °C in order to increase synergetic heat integration and system reliability. Herein, the latest development of high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT‐PEMFCs) is critically reviewed. The prospect of the integrated HT‐PEMFCs‐MSR as a reliable and compact power source is discussed. The results indicate that phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole (PA/PBI) membranes with in situ formed phosphosilicate nanocluster proton carriers show the technical feasibility of the development of HT‐PEMFCs at temperatures of 200–300 °C.",

To address this limitation, a nonaqueous organic flow battery using two‐electron anthraquinone anolyte and phenothiazine catholyte materials is developed. Structural tailoring leads to greatly improved solubilities with the cell potentials of 1.63 and 2.80 V for the first and second electron transfer reactions, respectively, of optimized ROMs. Doubled charge storage capacities indicative of 2e − reactions are achieved in proof‐of‐concept bulk electrolyte and flow cell demonstrations, albeit with only modest cyclability due to the limited stability of the second redox event. Although further improvement is still needed to attract practical interest, this study opens a promising pathway to increase the energy density for organic flow batteries and is expected to inspire more in‐depth studies of energy dense, stable ROMs.",

The dual‐functional material with single component is prepared by a simply carbonizing biowaste platanus fruit. A high evaporation rate up to 2.00 kg m −2 h −1 under one sun is achieved by 3D spherical evaporator. 3D evaporator also presents outstanding water evaporation under low light intensity, angle‐independent water evaporation, and long‐term cycling stability. Importantly, high‐capacity dye adsorption and generation of purified water are simultaneously achieved with the assistance of solar‐driven evaporation under one sun. Thus, the monolithic, dual‐functional 3D material with a simple preparation process, low cost, mechanical robustness, and environmental friendliness has great potential for solar steam generation and solar water evaporation‐assisted adsorption.

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar steam generation as an emerging solar desalination technology has drawn tremendous research attention owing to its enticing prospects in tackling the rising water crisis across the globe. Despite the numerous reports on materials with high evaporation rates, little is known about how the system geometry and ambient conditions impact the evaporation rate. The ambient relative humidity (RH), which can potentially impact on the evaporation process in the system is one such element that is not well studied. In this work, microchanneled balsa wood is employed as the research model in the quantitative investigations of these effects from the system itself and ambience. Direct implications and the interaction of various factors like ambient RH, hydrophilicity and specific weight of the material, carbonization thickness, and the water salinity are outlined. The trade‐off between surface water content and the interfacial temperature is revealed, and interestingly, a local “low‐humidity” zone is observed over the system's evaporation surface, which can sustain the evaporation even at extremely high RH. By tuning the system/ambience interactions, a systematic approach toward realizing the full potential of steam generators with optimized evaporation rate (10–20% enhancement) is therefore deemed achievable.",

Herein, highly crystalline MOF particles are incorporated into agarose (AG) to fabricate highly recyclable MOF aerogels. Along with greatly improved recyclability, these MOF aerogels also achieve eco‐friendliness and cost‐effectiveness because AG is highly abundant in nature and can be easily modified.

The two most promising routes for its large‐scale production in high purity are electrocatalytic water splitting and chemical release from hydrogen‐storage materials. The rational design and synthesis of robust catalysts for hydrogen evolution are crucial stages in the development of hydrogen as an energy source. This work reports the production of a novel hydrogen evolution catalyst consisting of uniform hollow porous carbon spheres loaded with ruthenium nanoclusters via a simple hydrothermal process at low temperature. The catalyst not only exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, with extremely low overpotentials at all pH values, but also shows outstanding activity for hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) with a high turnover frequency. Furthermore, the catalyst remains stable during both reactions, thus allowing one unified catalyst to facilitate hydrogen generation by two different methods for highly efficient and superstable hydrogen production. This work may provide a template method for rational design and fabrication of various metals/N‐doped carbon catalysts that promote hydrogen production through both the electrolysis of water and the hydrolysis of AB, which will advance the development of hydrogen as an energy source.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ten years have passed since the discovery of the first nitrogen‐doped carbon‐based metal‐free catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction, which opened a new field of catalysis toward a large variety of important applications, ranging from energy conversion and storage to environmental remediation. Various heteroatom‐doped carbons, beyond nitrogen‐doping (N‐doping), with distinctive features have also been developed for many specific reactions of practical significance (e.g., oxygen reduction (ORR), water splitting (OER and HER), CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR), and N 2 reduction (NRR)). However, the topic of metal‐free non‐N‐doped carbon electrocatalysts has not been reviewed till now. This article aims to review recent advances in non‐N‐doped carbon electrocatalysts with an emphasis on their synthesis, catalytic mechanisms, and catalytic performance in various electrochemical reactions, including the ORR, OER, HER, H 2 O 2 production, NRR, and CO 2 RR. Like N‐doping, boron‐doping, phosphorus‐doping, and fluorine‐doping are found to show similar catalytic efficiency for the ORR, OER, and HER. However, oxygen‐doping and boron‐doping are particularly favorable for the selective production of H 2 O 2 and NH 3 , respectively, exceeding the performance of N‐doping. Along with the timely and critical overview on the non‐N‐doped carbon electrocatalysts, current challenges and future perspectives for this emerging field are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Environmentally friendly energy devices and systems are of increasing interest for the circular economy and sustainable information and communications technology. To this end, an energy‐autonomous system comprised of natural jute fiber‐based supercapacitor (SC) and sensors (temperature and humidity) is presented. This material is coated with poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/single‐walled carbon nanotubes as the electrode and cellulose‐based material as a separator. Further, a newly prepared hydroxyethyl cellulose‐potassium chloride based gel is used as the electrolyte. The observed capacitance is nearly twice the value reported for similar SCs. The energy and power densities of the presented SC are 0.712 μWh cm −1 and 3.85 µW cm −1 , respectively at a capacitance of 8.65 mF cm −1 and an applied current of 0.1 mA. The fabricated temperature sensor shows a relative change in response of 0.23% °C −1 from 24 to 35 °C and the humidity sensor exhibits a sensitivity of 1.5 Ω/%RH (relative change of 0.20%) up to 50%RH. Developed using sustainable and biocompatible materials, the presented SC can power the jute‐fiber based sensors, thus demonstrating an attractive eco‐friendly solution for applications such as wearables, grain sacks, and bags.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fog harvesting is useful for passively collecting fresh water in arid regions, but the efficiency of current mesh‐based harvesters is compromised by their poor drainage. Inspired by the linear needles of redwood trees, “fog harps” are developed whose array of vertical wires enables an unobstructed drainage pathway. A full‐scale (1 m 2 frame) fog harp is fabricated by winding a stainless steel wire around a spinning aluminum frame featuring threaded rods. The fog harp is field tested for a full year at a local farm (Blacksburg, VA, USA), alongside the control case of a mesh harvester. Under moderate fog conditions, the fog harp collects anywhere from 2 to 78 times more water compared to the mesh harvesters. Under light fog conditions, the fog harp collects up to several hundred milliliters of water per day while the mesh is unable to collect any water at all. The water harvesting performance of fog harps is therefore unprecedented in two ways: they substantively elevate the performance ceiling when exposed to healthy fog while also enabling, for the first time, appreciable water harvesting under light fog.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water is one of the basic needs and vital concerns for human beings. As the world's population increases, our water resources become significantly stressed, not in terms of volume of water, but in terms of quality. Therefore, various water treatment processes such as filtration, adsorption, photocatalysis, and electrolysis are utilized based on the nature of contaminants present in water. 3D printing (3DP) manifests divergent development in different industries and scholastic research. Professionals from various sectors are utilizing the 3DP technique over conventional ones because it is more affordable, user‐friendly, and capable to manufacture complex structures rapidly with minimum wastage. This review summarizes the potential evolution, important outcomes of relevant research work, and future perspectives along with suggestions regarding the function of 3D printed material for water treatment applications. It is observed that a 3D printed spacer with modified geometry shows better antifouling ability than conventional ones. Furthermore, 3D printed materials with tunable properties such as surface area, thickness, and roughness enhance the removal efficiency for heavy metals, oil, and organic matter from water compared to standard treatment techniques.",

A flexible ultrathin graphene–carbon cloth (CC)‐based carbon–carbon composites is prepared by in situ electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide. The carbon–carbon composite materials demonstrate high performance in photothermal evaporation; more importantly, all carbon‐based devices can also be operated as low‐voltage Joule heating elements in wide temperature range up to 389 °C. Even when a very low voltage of 3 V is applied, the graphene–CC heater can reach a very high heating speed up to 112 °C s –1 , and a steady‐state temperature up to 292 °C within 10 s only. The low‐voltage heater promises to be the most effective solution for high‐speed interfacial evaporation since its evaporation rate can reach up to 45.87 kg m −2 h −1 , enhanced by one order of magnitude compared to the best solar power photothermal seawater desalination devices ever reported.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar irradiation is a promising resource for sustainable energy conversion and storage in many technological fields. Interfacial solar steam generator is emerging as a sustainable system for water harvesting under natural solar irradiance. However, natural sunlight is usually insufficient for conventional interfacial (2D absorber) solar steam generators to achieve high solar steam efficiency (&gt;85%). Herein, a functionalized MXene‐polymeric membrane‐based solar steam generator in a heat localization structure is reported as an efficient water harvesting and desalination system. The functionalized MXene flakes are homogeneously dispersed and encapsulated in polymeric networks of cellulose acetate in the crosslinking process, where water is automatically pumped through the absorber in the embedded nano/micro channels. As such, the fabricated solar steam generator shows a net evaporation rate (with respect to that in the dark condition) of 1.47 kg m −2 h −1 with 92.1% efficiency under 1 sun illumination. Moreover, the salt rejection rate for high salinity seawater (original Na + concentration is 18 000 mg L −1 ) reaches up to 97.5%, generating drinkable water that meets the WHO standard. The new photothermal membrane absorber is cost‐effective, scalable, washable, and stable under harsh conditions; holding great promise for practical solar desalination applications.",

The requirements for a perovskite solar cell (PSC) to offer maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) under low illumination conditions are not totally clear in the literature. In this work, the PCE of the commonly used SnO 2 electron transport layer (ETL) is improved by a facile method, doping the precursor nanoparticles with small concentrations of a Pb source. Under low illumination conditions (i.e., 0.1 mW cm −2 ) the PCE is enhanced from 18.8% to 34.2%. From a complete analysis of the ETLs and devices using several structural and electrical techniques it is observed that the parameter that improves the most is the shunt resistance of the device which avoids the parallel leakage of the photogenerated current. The present work clearly shows that the shunt resistance is a very important parameter that needs to be optimized in PSCs for low illumination conditions.",

Compared to the traditional physical and chemical synthesis, the green method of biosynthesis stands out and has become a favorite route in the research field as it conforms to the sustainable development of modern society. The biosynthesis process of ZnO nanomaterials is mainly divided into two parts: one is the pretreatment of plant components; the other is the dissolving of plant extracts in zinc precursor solution to form ZnO nanomaterials. During this process, the precursor that provides the zinc source is reduced to precipitate zinc oxide. As a routine confirmatory test, a series of characterization techniques are conducted, and the results show that the synthesized zinc oxide nanomaterials can exhibit good antibacterial, photocatalytic, anti‐oxidant, and anti‐cancer properties. In addition, prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks of bioinspired zinc oxide are further verified and discussed in this work.

Indeed, biocompatible and/or biodegradable inorganic elements exhibit high electrical conductivity, various morphologies for effective percolation networks, cytocompatibility, soft mechanical characteristics compared to ICPs, and many functions such as magnetism, photoluminescence, and electrochemical reactivity. This review introduces recent advances in biologically safe and biodegradable conductive polymer composites, including materials selection, relevant fabrication strategies, and various potential applications, aimed at revealing the potential applicability of inorganic elements in conductive composites, which has not been discussed in other reviews.

    "abstract": "Abstract The preparation of wood substrates modified by charged inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) diffusing into the internal cell wall structure is investigated for generating functional properties. The flammability problem of wood biocomposites is addressed. NPs applied from colloidal sols carry charge to stabilize them against aggregation. The influence of charge on particle diffusion and adsorption should play a role for their spatial distribution and localization in the wood substrate biocomposite. It is hypothesized that improved dispersion, infiltration, and stability of NPs into the wood structure can be achieved by charge control diffusion, also restricting NP agglomeration and limiting distribution to the wood cell wall. Cationic and anionic silica NPs of ≈30 nm are therefore allowed to diffuse into bleached wood. The influence of charge on distribution in wood is investigated as a function of initial sol concentration. Transparent wood is fabricated by in situ polymerization of a thiol‐ene in the wood pore space. These biocomposites demonstrate excellent flame retardancy with self‐extinguishing characteristics. The approach has potential for commercial fabrication of flame retardant transparent composites for glazing and other building applications.",

Both electrodes present good activity, with a decrease in the overpotential for nitrobenzene reduction and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction when Pd is deposited in the surface of the Cu electrode. It is observed that the rate and selectivity of nitrobenzene reduction to aniline improves at high concentrations, obtaining yields close to 70% for 30 × 10 −3 m initial concentrations of nitrobenzene when using Pd decorated Cu electrodes. Impedance spectroscopy analysis reveals that the role of Pd in the decorated electrodes is to enhance the production of H * radicals, necessary for the nitrobenzene reduction process. This explains the increase in the selectivity toward aniline production by the incorporation of small amounts of Pd in the surface of the Cu electrode.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The next generation of green ion selective membranes is foreseen to be based on cellulosic nanomaterials with controllable properties. The introduction of ionic groups into the cellulose structure via chemical modification is one strategy to obtain desired functionalities. In this work, bleached softwood fibers are oxidatively sulfonated and thereafter homogenized to liberate the cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) from the fiber walls. The liberated CNFs are subsequently used to prepare and characterize novel cellulose membranes. It is found that the degree of sulfonation collectively affects several important properties of the membranes via the density of fixed charged groups on the surfaces of the CNFs, in particular the membrane morphology, water uptake and swelling, and correspondingly the ionic transport. Both ionic conductivity and cation transport increase with the increased level of sulfonation of the starting material. Thus, it is shown that the chemical modification of the CNFs can be used as a tool for precise and rational design of green ion selective membranes that can replace expensive conventional fluorinated ionomer membranes.",

With boosting reaction kinetics, the as‐made ternary alloy catalyst exhibits improved HER efficiency, achieving a low overpotential/Tafel slope of 22.14 mV/23.92 mV dec −1 in the 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 and 46.52 mV/37.82 mV dec −1 in the 1.0 m KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the NiRuPt/Activated XC‐72 shows high TOFs (4.13 H 2 s −1 at 50 mV/3.88 H 2 s −1 at 100 mV in acidic/alkaline electrolyte) and great long‐term stability. This study suggests that the development of Pt‐based ternary nanoalloys is an attractive strategy for using low‐precious metal‐content catalysts for electrochemical energy‐related technologies.",

In this regard, mycelium composite production can present one potential solution.

However, it remains a challenge to retain this vibrant coloration into the solid state.

The obtained results show that the addition of acetic acid (before or after the preparation of wax/HNT microspheres) affects the properties of the composite films as well as the colloidal stability of PE. The colloidal behavior of CHI/HNT/wax PE by optical microscopy and sedimentation tests are studied. On the other hand, the corresponding composite films (prepared by solvent casting method) are characterized through several techniques, including Scanning Electron Microscopy, UV–vis spectrometer, water permeability, and contact angle measurements. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis allows this to estimate the effect of wax microparticles on the tensile performances of CHI‐based films. As a general consideration, the filling of the CHI matrix with wax/HNT improves the physicochemical properties of the films. Finally, the efficacy of the films as adsorbents of n‐dodecane vapors is explored. Due to the presence of hydrophobic domains (wax embedded in CHI), the composite films possess higher adsorption efficiencies compared to pristine CHI. Accordingly, it can be stated that the combination of CHI with wax/HNT microparticles is promising to obtain biocompatible composite films useful for remediation purposes.",

Once generated, micro‐ and nano‐plastics end‐up in the environment, causing widespread health and environmental risks. This is a significant environmental problem given the minuscule sizes of microplastics, and therefore warrants further investigation. This study presents a comprehensive review of the ecotoxicology of microplastics and methods for their degradation and decomposition besides discussing the fate and transport processes, recent progress, emerging strategies, challenges and potential future directions. The authors carefully evaluate the processes through which microplastics cause harm, from molecular interactions in species, to ecological impacts, and end with advances in microplastic biodegradation. Different kinds of microplastics found in the environment include polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate, polyurethane, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. Analysis of microbial and enzymatic decomposition provides several swelling mitigation strategies designed to reduce environmental threats. In‐depth investigations of microplastic ecotoxicity and biodegradation are being facilitated by interdisciplinary proposals in the areas of nanotechnology, new analytical methods, and synthetic biology. The extensive study helps understand microplastics comprehensively which in‐turn ensures informed actions to mitigate the challenge of the environmental impact of microplastics for sustainable future.",

In this work, an innovative sunlight‐driven device composed of bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) grown on a material derived from natural sources, i.e., Lightweight Expanded Clay Aggregates (LECA), is developed to clean surface waters under natural solar light irradiation. For this purpose, the photodegradation of two non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen, and diclofenac, is investigated under varying operative conditions. Laboratory‐ and real‐scale experiments reveal that the fabricated floating BiOBr/LECA photocatalyst fully degrades diclofenac, whereas limited abatement of ibuprofen is observed. Based on the identification of specific transformation products (TPs) during the degradation, this behavior seems to be strongly related to the different structures of the two drugs. In fact, the main TP produced during diclofenac degradation derives from dechlorination and ring condensation: this type of photocatalytic degradation pathway is generally favored over the C─C bonds's cleavage, which is a unique possibility for IBU abatement. Moreover, the potential partial adsorption of these species on the photocatalyst's active sites can cause their deactivation. Finally, reusability tests demonstrate the high stability of the floating composite.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Laser‐induced graphene (LIG) is widely used to fabricate microsupercapacitors (MSCs) on various sustainable substrates, such as wood, cork, and lignin. However, the fabrication of MSCs, especially high energy density devices on paper, has rarely been reported. In this work, LIG electrodes are fabricated on wax‐coated paper, followed by electrochemical deposition of manganese oxide (MnO 2 ). The obtained LIG/MnO 2 supercapacitors exhibit a maximum areal capacitance of 86.9 mF cm −2 , while a device with pristine LIG electrodes exhibit a capacitance of 9.1 mF cm −2 , both measured at a current density of 0.1 mA cm −2 . In addition, the supercapacitor exhibits good cycling stability, retaining 80% of its initial capacitance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm −2 . Notably, the LIG/MnO 2 supercapacitor exhibits an exceptionally high energy density of 7.3 µWh cm −2 at a power density of 38.8 µW cm −2 . In summary, a simple, fast, scalable, reproducible, and energy‐efficient fabrication method is represented using electrochemical deposition of manganese oxide on paper‐based laser‐induced graphene, which are natural, abundant, and sustainable materials, paving the way for large‐scale production of environmentally friendly supercapacitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The fast‐growing usage of electronics is creating large amounts of e‐waste (electronic waste), most of which are directly sent into landfills or incinerated as recycling is either impractical or too costly. Therefore, it is believed that degradable, environmentally friendly materials are the solution to this pressing issue. Herein, disintegrable, durable, and highly stretchable strain sensors are developed based on elastic thin films made of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, glycerol, and polyvinyl alcohol. The polymer thin films show a failure strain up to ≈ 330% and low hysteresis (5.74% at the second cycle) when subjected to 50% cyclic strain, due to the formation of inter or intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Carbon nanofibers with Au thin film are deposited on the elastic thin film, resulting in highly stretchable piezoresistive strain sensors with a maximum gauge factor of 1.7. More interestingly, the as‐developed sensors can be completely broken down in hot water (at ≈ 95 °C) within ≈ 25 min, indicating their remarkable disintegrability. This unique characteristic is expected to contribute to environmental sustainability. The applications of the sensor for joint bending recognition as well as physiological sign measurement have been demonstrated.",

SCs made only with graphene electrodes and PVA/H 3 PO 4 electrolyte exhibited a capacitance/energy‐density of 421.4 F g −1 /58.5 W·h kg −1 . After adding the G/SiO 2 /MgO (GSM) and G/SiO 2 /MgO‐MnO 2 (GSMM) nanocomposites to the SC electrodes, the capacitance increased by 36% and 69%, respectively. To develop an environmentally friendly SC, we substituted the acidic electrolyte with seawater or ERB electrolyte and compared their electrochemical performance. SCs made GSM and GSMM composites (seawater was the electrolyte) showed specific capacitances/energy‐densities of 679.7 F g −1 /94.4 W·h kg −1 and 852.3 F g −1 /118.5 W·h kg −1 , respectively, which were ∼20% higher compared with these for SCs made with acidic‐electrolyte. SCs made with ERB‐electrolyte and GSMM composite had a lower capacitance (683.3 F g −1 ) in comparison with SCs made with GSMM/acidic electrolyte (710.4 F g −1 ). Electrochemical‐impedance‐ spectroscopy (EIS) analysis demonstrated that the lowest charge‐transfer‐resistance and series‐resistance were obtained in SCs made with seawater‐electrolyte, therefore, those SC had the most efficient ion storage/diffusion. Finally, UV‐Vis/Raman/XPS studies revealed the presence of oxygen‐vacancies, Mg 2+ /Mg 0 , Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ , and Si 4+ /Si 3+ /Si 2+ species on the SC electrodes (active‐redox‐centers to store charge).",

Diatomaceous earth functionalized with carboxyl groups showed a better removal efficiency of MB (up to 100%) than functionalized silica. The removal of MO with functionalized imidazolium species is found to be comparable (up to 70%).

Among the various modification strategies, separator modification offers a promising approach to address issues on both anodes and cathodes. In this study, a bifunctional asymmetric polypropylene (PP) separator is modified with nitrogen‐doped reduced graphene oxide (N–rGO) on the cathode side and cellulose fibers (CF) on the anode side to address the challenges associated with both electrodes. CF effectively promotes the uniform deposition of lithium metal and significantly inhibits the growth of lithium dendrites. In addition, N–rGO with a porous structure and nitrogen‐doped active sites can not only suppress lithium polysulfide shuttling by physical and chemical adsorption but also catalyze the kinetics of the redox reaction, leading to an increased specific capacity of the battery. The Li─S battery incorporating N–rGO@PP@CF separator exhibits an impressive specific capacity of 1294 mAh g −1 at a current rate of 1 C, with a remarkably low average capacity decay of 0.076% per cycle over 500 cycles. The synergistic effect between CF and N–rGO modification on asymmetric separators provides a promising guideline for developing high‐performance Li─S batteries.",

This study proposes an optimized method for recycling bifacial solar panels, which lack a back sheet and use ethylene‐vinyl acetate (EVA) as the sole encapsulant. The process achieves 100% recovery of valuable materials, including polymerized oil, clean glass, solar cells, and copper tape. Unlike traditional PV panels with back sheet polymers like PVF, PET, or PVDF, bifacial panels simplify the recycling process. EVA, composed of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, is more environmentally friendly, especially without fluorinated compounds. Using a modified pyrolysis reactor, the EVA layer is degraded in inert conditions, minimizing emissions and producing polymerized oil. This oil can be used as a lubricant, while the recovered glass, solar cells, and copper tape are reusable in manufacturing new panels. Optimized oil yield is achieved using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Box‐Behnken Design (BBD). At a heating rate of 8.92 °C min −1 , a 31.82‐min hold time, and a maximum temperature of 528.22 °C, the process yields 57.53% polymerized oil. The oil is characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), meeting ASTM and Australian diesel standards. This method maximizes material recovery and supports a circular economy, enhancing solar energy system sustainability.",

Electrochemical seawater splitting is a sustainable approach for hydrogen production and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sequestration, producing hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen or chlorine gas at the anode. Simultaneously, minerals such as calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide precipitate at the cathode, especially when coupled with CO 2 injections for the sake of CO 2 sequestration. These precipitates are often dismissed as energy‐intensive byproducts. However, they have untapped potential as resources for construction, manufacturing, and environmental remediation. Here, a comprehensive experimental investigation is presented into the electrochemical precipitation of minerals in seawater under varying operational conditions. By systematically varying applied voltage, current density, and CO 2 flow rate, the conditions that optimize mineral yield and selectivity while minimizing energy consumption are revealed. The findings advance the understanding of electrochemical synthesis and material processing in aqueous solutions, with a particular focus on the mineralization of calcareous compounds and their transformation into large‐scale aggregates. These findings also support an additional and highly scalable application of seawater electrolysis, encompassing not only oceanic renewable hydrogen production and CO 2 sequestration but also the sustainable production of carbon‐trapping minerals and aggregates.",

Further, extensive usage of fossil fuel‐based resources results in unfavorable consequences such as pollution and climate change. As a result, global attention is drawn to the sustainable generation of clean fuel from renewable energy. In this context, hydrogen (H 2 ) is gaining tremendous interest researchers as a clean, environmentally benign alternative to fossil fuels that can be used directly in automobiles or in fuel cells to generate power. Biomass, on the other hand, is one of the most abundant carbon‐based renewable energy sources as plants create it through photosynthesis. Consequently, controlled degradation of raw biomass can produce ethanol, furans, 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural, lactic acid, succinic acid, and other key intermediates which can be further converted into value‐added compounds. In light of these advantages, recent studies show that photocatalytic H 2 production from water can be coupled with the valorization of biomass derivatives to develop a greener and environmentally friendly protocol to produce value‐added chemicals. Herein, a comprehensive account of the recent developments in the area of visible light‐assisted simultaneous production of H 2 and value‐added chemicals from biomass derivatives is provided.",

To address these issues, a bio‐strategy involving the functionalization of a commercial separator with an amino acid‐polymer system, leucine‐polyacrylic acid (Leu‐PAA), is reported here. A simple soaking method is used in preparing the separator with the Leu‐PAA, which is effective and viable for practical application.

Hence, delamination and the separation of delaminated MXenes from impurities is critical and results in low yield. This study demonstrates post‐processing techniques involving repeated ultrasonication followed by centrifugation of the initial etched MXene (DI‐MXene) solution, which results in a highly delaminated, impurity‐free supernatant with a higher yield. This delaminated MXene (DI‐uMXene) exhibits improved specific capacitance (402 F g −1 ) and conductivity (210 S cm −1 ) compared to DI‐MXene (238 F g −1 and 150 S cm −1 , respectively). Further washing of DI‐MXene with HCl acid instead of DI water is explored as an alternate LiF removal method. This process removes intercalated Li + ions, reducing inter‐layer spacing and specific capacitance. Nonetheless, conductivity is improved to 390 S cm −1 because of the removal of non‐conductive LiF. The study also reports that DI‐uMXene's capacitance is primarily surface‐controlled with low Warburg impedance. Finally, an asymmetric coin cell supercapacitor device is constructed using the DI‐uMXene as the negative electrode, and their electrochemical performances are studied.

This, combined with suboptimal spatial efficiency, restricts their overall output performance.

These generators leverage the synergistic interaction between gravitational, magnetic, and inertial forces.

    "abstract": "Abstract Given the rising global energy demands and environmental concerns, developing efficient, non‐hazardous methods for producing electrocatalysts is crucial. The challenge lies not only in enhancing catalyst performance but also in finding scalable, cost‐effective techniques for large‐scale production. Plasma technologies, with their adaptability and versatility in energy conversion and storage, have garnered significant attention. These chemical‐free methods provide precise control over material properties and enable the fabrication of high‐performance electrocatalysts in a single step. In this work, plasma technology is leveraged to fabricate a durable, high‐performance NiMo electrocatalyst in varying ratios (3:1, 3:2, 3:3) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using atmospheric plasma spray. The NiMo(3:3) composition demonstrates superior catalytic performance with an overpotential of 112 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm −2 . Further, Low‐pressure nitrogen plasma treatment for 15 minutes significantly reduces the overpotential to 78 mV, enhancing HER performance by altering surface properties and boosting active site exposure. The catalyst also shows a lower Tafel value of 57.16 mV dec −1 and high stability in chronoamperometry under acidic conditions for 30 hours, proving its sustainability in harsh environments. This work provides solid evidence of plasma's suitability as a powerful and sustainable approach for fabricating advanced electrocatalysts in energy applications",

Electrolytes have an important influence on the electrochemical performance of lithium–oxygen batteries, especially on their cycling stability and rate capacity. Therefore, it is important to select an ideal electrolyte with excellent stability against attack by reaction intermediates, along with excellent oxygen solubility and diffusivity.

In this work, a robust CuCr 2 O 4 /SiO 2 composite membrane with outstanding solar‐driven water evaporation performance (1.32 kg m −2 h −1 ) under one sun irradiation is rationally designed and synthesized by using quartz glass fibrous membrane as supporting matrix and stable CuCr 2 O 4 particles as the active light absorber. Instead of coating a separate layer on top of the support, the CuCr 2 O 4 particles are evenly distributed inside the matrix, which endows the membrane with great mechanical strength and excellent wear and abrasion resistance. The highly porous composite survives 6 atm pressure and retains its performance even after 75% of the membrane is removed by sandpaper. This work also looks into a generally overlooked aspect of wet versus dry state of photothermal material and its implications. Interestingly, the composite possesses a gray color with a high reflectance in dry state but turns into deep black with a low reflectance in wet state due to the decreased subsurface scattering and strong NIR light absorbance of water in wet state. This composite material also possesses excellent thermal stability and thermal shock resistance, making it able to be easily recovered by calcination in air or direct burning in fire for contaminants removal. The results demonstrate that this composite is a competitive photothermal material for practical solar distillation and indicate that the optical properties of material in wet state are more relevant to photothermal material screening and optimization for solar distillation.",

    "abstract": "Coproduction of valuable chemicals such as halides or hydrogen peroxide concomitant with hydrogen production is presented as a strategy to boost the industrial applicability of photo-electrochemical and photocatalytic systems. Highly efficient two-photon devices can be fabricated (solar-to-chemical efficiencies of >27%), whereas single absorber devices will be appropriate for, for example, HBr splitting and efficiencies of almost 19% can be obtained. Seasonal fluctuations in renewable energy production have stimulated investigation of approaches to photosynthetically produce fuels, such as hydrogen.1-3 These so-called solar fuels need to be scalable to the terawatt level, and therefore the considered coproduct of fuel is usually oxygen.1-5 Since oxygen has negligible economic value, an attractive alternative approach would be to produce value-added oxidation products.6, 7 Production of economically favorable products (see Table 1) or purification of waste streams,8 might considerably reduce time to market of photo-electrochemistry (PEC)-based devices. Oxidation of halides is an interesting alternative to oxidation of water. Anodic conversion of halide-containing salts (NaCl, KBr), or acids (HCl, HBr) leads to gaseous products (i.e., Cl2, Br2). Cl2 is typically used to make PVC, or is used in the production of pharmaceuticals. Cl2 is already produced commercially via electrolysis, thus the fundamental kn owledge for future PEC chlorine electrolysis is already established. The annual production of chlorine is the equivalent of 0.2 TJ worth of H2 storage. While this amount is insufficient for worldwide energy storage requirements, it is still significant. Bromine is frequently used for production of chemical intermediates and its production has already been considered by Texas Instruments using PEC-based devices.15 Various researchers have evaluated this path recently.16, 17 Hydrogen peroxide is another interesting product, due to its high economic value. It is used as disinfectant, bleach, or soft oxidant. While industrially H2O2 is produced using the anthraquinone oxidation process,18 it is also well known that H2O2 can be produced via electrochemical oxygen reduction.19, 20 Finally, H2O2 can be produced via electrochemical oxidation of water, albeit at relatively low faradaic efficiency, due to competitive O2 production. For carbon-based electrodes, efficiencies of 30%–50% have been reported.21 Additionally, oxides such as MnOx appear promising catalysts.22, 23 Table 1 shows that the current market price of the mentioned alternatives is significantly more attractive than oxygen. The material requirements (e.g., to be corrosion resistant) and the techno-economic viability of these devices should share many of the same traits as reported for PEC water splitting.9, 24, 25 Since all of the aforementioned reactions are simple 2e− oxidation reactions with minimal overpotential, losses should be less important than encountered in water oxidation.26, 27 PEC systems for water splitting17, 28-33 have been extensively modeled, and to less extent PEC systems for CO2 reduction have been as well.34, 35 To the best of our knowledge, in-depth modeling of halide oxidation, or oxidation of water to H2O2, has yet to be published. In this perspective, we therefore model single and dual absorber devices where hydrogen (as a fuel) and valuable oxidation products are simultaneously produced. We discuss the effect of the thermodynamic potential and kinetics of the different oxidation reactions on the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies of PEC devices and point out how new catalysts for partial oxidation of water to H2O2 will increase PEC efficiencies. Utilizing state-of-the-art modeling approaches provided by a JavaScript, web based model (WBM) developed by Seger et al.,32 we will demonstrate that bromine, chlorine, and hydrogen peroxide based STH conversion efficiencies are high, and PEC technology may be economically viable. Nevertheless, the 2e− oxidation process of Cl2 is favored if well-designed electrodes are used inducing a low overpotential for the Cl2 production reaction, while reducing the high overpotential for the thermodynamically favored OER (in acidic solutions) is challenging.36-42 BrER with only one reaction intermediate can easily be kinetically favored as well.16, 43, 44 Using the WBM we have calculated solar-to-chemical/solar-to-hydrogen (STC/STH) efficiencies of different devices (for further information see the Supporting Information). The baseline parameters used to model these devices were chosen in agreement with previous work by Seger et al.32 (see Table 2 and Table S1 and Figure S1, Supporting Information). For BrER and ClER the parameters were modified to account for changes in overpotential and ionic conductivity. For further information about the parameters, see the Supporting Information. Figure 1a,b shows the obtainable STC/STH efficiencies for a PEC device containing a stacked, two-photon absorber, with the oxidation reactions being BrER (Figure 1a and Figure S2, Supporting Information) and ClER. The corresponding STH efficiency considering OER is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). With increasing thermodynamic potential of the aimed product, the STH efficiency gradually increases, that is, for BrER a maximum STH of 19.7% can be obtained, whereas for OER and ClER, theoretical STH efficiencies of 22.0% and 24.5% can be achieved. The minimal necessary operating voltage for the BrER, OER, and ClER devices at their maximum operating point is 1.48, 1.73, and 1.73 V, respectively (see the Supporting Information for further information). This analysis shows that even though the BrER reaction has a lower overpotential than the OER reaction, it actually is predicted to result in less efficient PEC devices. This peculiarity is rationalized by the definition of efficiency that relates to the chemical potential difference between reactants and products. When water is oxidized this difference is 1.23 V, whereas bromide ions are oxidized at 1.09 V. As noted by Vesborg and Seger, PEC reactions with operating potentials near 2 V are optimally suited to match the efficiency of two-photon tandem PEC devices.35 Given that the BrER reaction operates at 1.48 V, whereas both the OER and ClER operate at 1.73 V, it is clear that deviation from the optimal tandem device voltage significantly affects solar-to-hydrogen fuel production and the BrER efficiency is mitigated by the misalignment of the reaction operating potential with the optimal tandem device potential. On the other hand, the choice of the oxidation reaction only slightly affects the most suitable band gap combination of top and bottom cell absorber. For all cases the optimal top cell absorber should have a band gap of Etop = 1.78 eV. To construct a PEC device with the highest STC efficiency a matching bottom cell absorber with a band gap of Ebot = 0.68–0.94 eV (with the narrowest range of (Ebot = 0.92–0.94 eV) for the OER) should be used. The lower voltage needed for the BrER also means that for most band gap combinations the device will be limited by photocurrent, rather than photovoltage. While at top cell band gaps above ≈1.75 eV, the top cell is providing the limiting photocurrent, at top cells below ≈1.75 eV the bottom cell is providing the limiting photocurrent. Figure 1c allows for the top cell photoabsorber to be thinned to optimize photon matching between both photoabsorbers. The corresponding percentage of thinning is shown in Figure 1d. This greatly expands the region of highly efficient devices, and allows the use of Si bottom cell absorbers with various top cell absorbers. Si is highly efficient and a well-studied material in PEC water splitting. The same top cell thinning approach was also calculated for the ClER (Figure S3, Supporting Information), resulting in a slightly smaller positive effect. Simulated STC efficiencies for PEC devices calculated with more dilute electrolytes are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). For HBr, decreasing the concentration to 0.1 m does not affect the maximum efficiency while decreasing the concentration to 0.01 m HBr results in a drop in efficiency of 7%. Hence, electrolyte-induced losses are negligible compared to other losses for electrolyte concentrations above 0.1 m. Below 0.1 m HBr ionic losses start to dominate.46 PEC devices that produce hydrogen peroxide (Figure 2) are characterized by a thermodynamic redox potential significantly more oxidative than the OER (1.78 V compared to 1.23 V for OER). This makes selective H2O2 production experimentally challenging. Nevertheless, selective production of hydrogen peroxide by oxidation of water was recently reported to occur on carbon materials and MnOx,21, 22 with these catalysts typically achieving a faradaic efficiency of 40%. Since these oxidation catalysts need basic conditions, the PEC modeling was done using either 0.1 or 1 m KOH with HER overpotentials slightly worse than our previous reactions done in acid (ɳHER = 35 mV45 @ 1 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1). The hydrogen peroxide overpotential (ɳH2O2) losses were fixed (15022 and 350 mV). The other conditions were chosen similar to BrER and ClER. Figure 2a displays the STC efficiencies for three different conditions assuming that catalytic/engineering improvements can increase the faradaic efficiency for oxidative hydrogen peroxide production to 100%. In reality, for example, in cases where hydrogen peroxide is produced with lower FE, mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide are produced. Hence, the resulting STC will be based on two different thermodynamic potentials, that is, for OER and H2O2. To achieve a good comparison between the different processes, 100% FE for H2O2 was used, similar to the FE that can be achieved for BrER, ClER, and OER, respectively. In general, all conditions allow high STC, with Figure 2a showing a maximum of up to 27.55% for a 1.87 eV/1.24 eV band gap combination assuming low overpotentials and a highly basic environment. This STC efficiency is quite high, due to the optimal operating potential near 2 V (see the Supporting Information for further information). Given that to date no catalyst providing faradaic efficiency of 100% for the selective two-electron oxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide is known, it should be emphasized that finding a good catalyst driving this reaction with high selectivity is one of the challenges that should be addressed. Still, even with suboptimized STC efficiencies, this might be quite an economically promising approach given the value of H2O2, as well as realizing that H2 produced in this device would still be running at 100% FE. Figure 2b shows that a 200 mV increase in catalytic losses only decreases the efficiency slightly to 25.32%. However, switching to 0.1 m KOH decreases the efficiency more drastically to 21.8%. Si (Eg = 1.12 eV) would be a well-suited bottom cell. For the conditions used in Figure 2b,c, that is, higher overpotential and lower electrolyte conductivity, the optimal bottom material requires a high band gap; a property of, for example, (expensive) GaAs. In Figure 2d, the contour plot obtained for top cell \"thinning\" is shown (Figure S5, Supporting Information shows the \"thinning %\" of the top cell absorber). From these data it is obvious that for a tandem device consisting of two stacked materials with similar band gap of 1.55 eV, \"thinning\" results in an increased (as well as total) STC efficiency of 19.7%. Considering two stacked GaAs cells (band gap of Eg ≈ 1.42 eV), STC efficiencies greater than 10% can be achieved by \"thinning\" down the top cell absorber by ≈52%. Given that GaAs produces much better photovoltages than used in the model, the actual efficiency could likely be even higher.47 For materials prepared by epitaxial growth this approach might reduce the cost significantly. An interesting point discovered with PEC water splitting is that while the highest potential efficiency can be obtained with a two-photon tandem PEC cell,17, 28-31 recent techno-economic analysis suggests that a single absorber approach utilizing a semiconductor with a large band gap is more feasible in terms of price per kg of hydrogen.24, 25 The authors clearly show that the capital costs for the implementation of hydrogen production facilities using a PEC tandem device approach are circumventing economical hydrogen production from water. Instead, a slurry-based particle approach with one-photon absorber might be more suitable as capital costs can be significantly reduced compared to tandem approaches.24, 25 Figure 3 investigates the approach of a single photoabsorber for BrER, ClER, and H2O2 by modeling the STC efficiencies using the same parameters as used in Figures 1 and 2, that is, faradaic efficiencies of 100%. In comparison to the tandem approach, the order in STC efficiencies is different, with HBr splitting being significantly more efficient than HCl or water-splitting. For HBr splitting, and applying an optimal single absorber with a band gap of 1.78 eV, STC efficiencies of 18.9% can be achieved almost exceeding the maximum efficiency of 19.0% for a dually stacked absorber device. This can be attributed both to the lower thermodynamic potential, as well as to the low band gap bottom cell. In tandem devices, the efficiency of the bottom cell is hampered by low energy photon absorption of the electrolyte.35 For single-cell absorbers, reactions with operating potentials near 1 V are optimally suited to achieve high efficiencies, as is the case for bromine oxidation. The high efficiencies calculated here for single band gap absorbers in HBr conversion are in good agreement with results obtained by McFarland and co-workers16, 48 proving the suitability of efficient single cell absorber devices. As can also be seen from Figure 3, higher STH efficiencies can be obtained for water and HCl conversion in tandem devices, as compared to single-cell absorbers, due to the higher operation potential required to drive these reactions. Finally, the data suggest that hydrogen peroxide production with a single absorber is relatively inefficient with an STC of 6.2%, and is less suited for large-scale solar hydrogen production. Photo-electrochemical splitting of water is considered a promising route to a hydrogen-based economy, however, high economic barriers are impeding its implementation. While costs will decrease with improving performance,24 in this work we show the feasibility of coproduction of valuable chemicals such as halides or H2O2 concomitant with H2 production. By doubling the amount of valuable products, the economic barrier is decreased, allowing solar H2 to enter the market. While the market for halides and/or H2O2 is small in comparison to H2, it is still large enough to allow for the development of a desperately needed photo-electrochemistry industry. It is anticipated that the high value of the oxidation products considered in this study might also allow building devices with lower STC/STH efficiencies. Still a detailed techno-economic feasibility study is required to support this assumption. Based on the modeling results presented in this perspective, solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies producing Br2, Cl2, or H2O2 are as high, or even higher than the efficiency of producing O2. The low thermodynamic potential for HBr activation allows for efficiencies for a single photoabsorber on par with that of a tandem device. Here, only Pt-based HER catalysts were considered, but materials with higher stability, that is, with higher corrosion resistance or lower tendency for halide adsorption,16 should be used in an actual device. For the devices discussed in this paper still several challenges need to be addressed before a successful implementation can be realized. As for PEC water splitting the lifetime of the device is a crucial factor and the harsh conditions used in these processes (but also in PEC water splitting) suggest that protection layers need to be used to limit the corrosion of the light-absorbing semiconductor. For devices producing hydrogen peroxide, catalyst development and testing is required, as to date selective electrocatalysts for oxidative hydrogen peroxide generation are not known. Besides the presented approaches, there might be other reaction combinations of interest for construction of economically viable solar-to-chemical production devices. In particular, devices producing hydrogen peroxide by two-electron reduction of oxygen, coupled to two-electron water oxidation to H2O2 should be considered. F. Diongi and J.

Among these MOFs, UiO‐66(Zr)‐NH 2 ‐F 4 ‐0.53 shows a binary CO 2 adsorption capacity of 0.76 mmol g −1 and a CO 2 /N 2 (15/85) selectivity of 18.9 at 298 K, which is among the best of all UiO‐66‐type MOFs. Besides, UiO‐66(Zr)‐NH 2 ‐F 4 ‐0.53 only loses 30% of its CO 2 uptake capacity under wet (70% relative humidity) CO 2 /N 2 (15/85) mixture condition at 298 K, compared with almost 100% loss of zeolite materials and other hydrophilic adsorbents under similar conditions. This moisture‐resistant feature makes UiO‐66(Zr)‐NH 2 ‐F 4 ‐0.53 one of the best physisorption‐based adsorbent materials for CO 2 capture under wet conditions so far. Moreover, UiO‐66(Zr)‐NH 2 ‐F 4 ‐0.53 demonstrates enhanced breakthrough dynamics with less cross‐column pressure drop ( ΔP ≈ 0 bar) and 2.7 times larger mass transfer coefficient ( k = 0.1235 s −1 ) than that of pristine UiO‐66(Zr)‐NH 2 ( ΔP ≈ 0.25 bar, k = 0.0334 s −1 ). The present study offers new insights into the heterogeneous synthesis of MTV‐MOFs and a paradigm to design hydrophobic MOFs with improved material features for moisture‐resistant CO 2 capture applications.",

Here, the direct electrochemical conversion of CO 2 to liquid products with a high overall Faradaic efficiency (FE) by utilizing a unique 3D, heterostructured copper electrode (referred as Cu sandwich) that is obtained via a simple two‐step treatment of commercially available copper foam is reported. The designed catalyst achieves an FE toward liquid products of &gt;50% at an applied potential as low as −0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The improved selectivity of the heterostructured Cu sandwich electrode at low overpotentials is attributed to the greater exposure of engineered Cu + /Cu 2+ interfaces (present on composite nanowires) and higher oxygen vacancy defects. Moreover, the rationally designed heterostructures prevent the Cu 2 O species from being reduced during CO 2 RR enabling the catalyst to demonstrate enhanced CO 2 RR activity with prolonged stability.",

The latter method to fabricate durable protective coatings on wood surfaces is adapted in the current work. The method is based on a first modification with a silicon oxide layer, followed by the grafting of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains. The obtained surfaces are hydrophobic, and are highly durable when compared to classical superhydrophobic coatings, in particular after prolonged immersion in water. A self‐healing ability, provided by the rearrangement of the PDMS chains after plasma treatment, is reported herein. Finally, the coatings have antismudge, antifouling, and antibacterial properties. With durable water repelling properties, quick self‐healing ability, antismudge, antifouling, and antibacterial properties, the durability of wood is increased. This research demonstrates the protection potential of liquid‐like polymer coatings on wood, a material that will play an essential role in the transition toward more sustainable societies.",

Combined salt templating with ZnCl 2 and hard templating with SBA‐15 is used to produce ordered mesoporous and microporous hard–salt‐templated carbons (OM‐HSTCs) from simple sucrose as carbon precursor. OM‐HSTCs achieve specific surface areas of more than 2600 m 2 g −1 and total pore volumes up to 2.2 cm 3 g −1 . In comparison to purely hard‐templated ordered mesoporous carbons, the additional salt template leads to high micropore volume and provides control over the size/distribution of micro‐ and mesopores and over the carbon microstructure.

When applied as electrode materials in electric double‐layer capacitors with 1 m tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile organic electrolyte, OM‐HSTCs combine high gravimetric capacitance (133 F g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 ) resulting from high micropore volume with high capacitance retention under high‐power conditions (126 F g −1 at 40 A g −1 ), exceeding the purely microporous or purely ordered mesoporous reference materials.",

The human endeavor to likewise craft value‐added structural materials from underappreciated, sustainably sourced feedstocks remains a formidable challenge.

Composites are achieved in which bulk sulfur is reinforced by a network of 1–20% by mass cellulose cross‐linked with polysulfide chains. Composites described herein are remeltable and have flexural strength exceeding that of Portland cement. A thorough analysis of these materials has been undertaken through nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical analysis. These analyses of both as‐prepared composites and fractionated materials unequivocally validate the formulation of these composites and the separability of the bulk sulfur from the reinforcing polysulfide‐cross‐linked cellulose network. The thermomechanical properties of these recyclable composites portend their tantalizing potential to supplant inherently unsustainable structural elements in numerous commercial applications. Further applications to improve the environmental resistance and flexural strength of Portland cement by treatment with the sulfur–cellulose composites are also discussed.",

In this study, a mycelium–nanocellulose biocomposite with hybrid properties is produced by the agitated liquid culture of a white‐rot fungus ( Trametes ochracea ) with nanocellulose (NC) comprised as part of the culture media. Mycelial development proceeds via the formation of pellets, where NC is enriched in the pellets and depleted from the surrounding liquid media. Micrometer‐scale NC elements become engulfed in mycelium, whereas it is hypothesized that the nanometer‐scale fraction becomes integrated within the hyphal cell wall, such that all NC in the system is essentially surface‐modified by mycelium. The NC confers mechanical strength to films processed from the biocomposite, whereas the mycelium screens typical cellulose–water interactions, giving fibrous slurries that dewater faster and films that exhibit significantly improved wet resistance in comparison to pure NC films. The mycelium–nanocellulose biocomposites are processable in the ways familiar to papermaking and are suggested for diverse applications, including packaging, filtration, and hygiene products.",

The molecular structure of the cellulose precursors and the carbonization/activation atmosphere (N 2 or CO 2 ) significantly influence the pore structure of the ACs. When using oxidized cellulose and its further cross‐linkages as the precursor, the ACs have a large volume of ultramicropores (pore diameter &lt; 0.8 nm). Activation in CO 2 results in ACs with surface areas up to 1241 m 2 g −1 . These ACs have a high CO 2 uptake capacity (2.29 mmol g −1 at 0.15 bar, 5.52 mmol g −1 at 1 bar; 273 K) and a high CO 2 –over–N 2 selectivity (42 at 273 K). In addition, the capacity of the ACs to adsorb vapors of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is remarkable, with values up to 0.97 mmol g −1 at very low VOC concentrations (200 ppmv). The ACs have ultrahigh VOCs–over–N 2 selectivity up to 9.35 × 10 3 at 293 K for 0.02 vol%/99.8 vol% of benzene/N 2 mixture. It is anticipated that these ACs will be useful as sorbents for the postcombustion capture of CO 2 and for indoor removal and direct air capture of various VOCs.",

The degradability and amphiphilic properties of zein are attractive for materials design. Unmodified zein polymers, however, have drawbacks when it comes to adhesive strength, water resistance, and wet adhesion. Here, compositions of zein plus plant‐based phenolics including catechol, tannic acid, juglone, caffeic acid, quercetin, and gallic acid are examined. Combinations of zein with phenolic components from plants provide high strength adhesive bonding. These catechol‐containing phenolics may present an analogy to the cross‐linking chemistry of catechol found in mussel‐mimetic adhesives. Bonding is tested on dry and wet aluminum substrates using lap shear configurations. In each case, bond strengths are substantial and exceed the minimal bonding of zein only controls. Maximum adhesion for zein + catechol is 8 ± 1 MPa. Under similar conditions, commercial Super Glue bonds at 8 ± 2 MPa. Further results involve examinations of bond persistence on substrates submerged under water. Such results indicate that proper formulation efforts yield strong adhesives with some water resistance. These studies show that benign components from food can provide performance comparable to the petroleum‐based materials in current wide spread use.",

Three different multifunctional molecules namely 5‐aminoisophthalic acid (AIA), 5‐hydroxyisophthalic acid (HIA), and chelidamic acid (CA) are strategically chosen.

In this work, a superhydrophilic NiCo nanoparticle array coupled with CeO 2 is integrated on graphite plate (NiCo–CeO 2 /GP) by electrodeposition and subsequent high‐temperature selective reduction. The coupled CeO 2 can accelerate dissociation of H 2 O and favor adsorption of hydrogen, prominently boosting the electrocatalytic HER activity of NiCo alloy. Also, the superhydrophilic self‐supported electrode can promote electron conduction, facilitate bubble release, and prevent catalyst shedding, ensuring an efficient and stable working condition.

Because of their unique features such as high power density, long cycling stability, and high capacitance, supercapacitors have emerged as a promising technology for storing energy. This review focuses on some of the recent advances in supercapacitors in the wake of solid waste and energy management. First, the utilization of a range of solid waste materials in the fabrication of supercapacitors is summarized. Thereafter, the roles of some of the recently developed “green” electrolytes in curbing the detrimental effects of waste generation from supercapacitors are discussed. Furthermore, different applications of supercapacitors in the field of energy management are highlighted. The strategies for the management of waste generated on account of a supercapacitor's end of life are also reported.

Here, gold nanospheres and nanostars are assembled into ridges/disordered nanohole arrays architecture in nanoparticle colloids using light‐trapping Papilio Paris forewings (OPPs) as templates. In solar steam generation, water evaporation efficiency reaches 83.3% for nanostar assemblies (NSAs) and 68.6% for nanosphere assemblies (NSPAs) under 1‐sun (1 kW m −2 ) irradiation. Both the biomimetic superstructures exhibit significant enhancement of near‐infrared light absorption compared to OPPs, and NSAs show higher absorption than NSPAs in the range of 200–2500 nm. Finite element method simulations reveal such broadband absorption is ascribed to the hybridization of localized surface plasmon modes of continuous‐assembled Au nanoparticles in the biomimetic structures as well as the wing photonic structures with light‐transferring ridges with an inverted V shape and light‐trapping disordered nanohole arrays. It is revealed that optical properties of superstructures can be tuned not only by controlling their 3D structures but also by changing the shape of nanosized building blocks. It is hoped that this work will provide inspirations for the design and assembly of nanophotonic structures and devices for solar energy conversion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Zinc–iodine batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their high performance and low cost. Nevertheless, their wide application is mainly limited by the preparation of iodine‐based cathode and dendrite‐free zinc anode. Flexible carbon fibers have attracted tremendous attention, due to their iodine encapsulation properties. This characteristic is a result of their porous structure, large surface area, and excellent intrinsic properties. With the development of carbon fibers for loading iodine, the surface properties can be rationally modulated via heteroatom doping and combination with various polymers can enhance battery performance. In this review, recent research advances on the functionalization of carbon fibers for ZIBs are summarized, with special focus on the pore size of carbon fibers, the species, and content of doping elements, and the selection of targeted polymers toward the loading of iodine. Finally, the prospects and future challenges of ZIBs based on carbon fibers are presented. The review aims to provide the basic guides for designing advanced iodine‐based electrode materials on the basis of carbon fibers with both compositional advantages and microporous structure to achieve high‐performance ZIBs.",

However, there are still many issues that remain, including but not only hydrogen evolution reaction, dendrite growth, and dramatic capacity loss at low temperatures.

Carbon‐based materials are widely used for supercapacitors but can be increased in energy density via combination with metal oxides. Red mud is an iron‐oxide‐rich by‐product of aluminum production, which needs to be more widely utilized to reduce its environmental damage. To achieve a flexible micro‐supercapacitor device with increased energy density, a laser‐induced graphene (LIG) supercapacitor is realized from a polyimide substrate, decorated with red‐mud nanoparticles (LIG‐RM), employing a solid‐state ionic liquid electrolyte with a mixture of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMI][TFSI]), and 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF 4 ]).

Researchers have been improving their ionic conductivity at room temperature, ionic transference number, and (electro)chemical stability. Here, a fiber‐reinforced CPE is prepared by infusing polyethylene oxide (PEO) and Li 6.4 La 3 Zr 1.4 Ta 0.6 O 12 (LLZTO) electrolytes onto polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber networks. The introduction of both inorganic ceramic filler LLZTO and plasticizer succinonitrile (SN) reduces the crystallinity of PEO, increases the solubility of lithium salts, and further improves ionic transport kinetics. The ionic conductivity of CPE is 2.57 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at 30 °C and the lithium‐ion transference number is 0.6. Meanwhile, the high content of LLZTO (60 wt.%) brings a better capability to suppress lithium dendrites, and thus lithium symmetrical cells based on this CPE can be stably cycled for up to 500 h. In addition, the PAN fiber network endows CPE with high mechanical strength and high oxidation resistivity, and accordingly an electrochemical stability window as high as 4.7 V. Both LiFePO 4 /CPE/Li and LiNi 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 /CPE/Li cells can be operated at 30 °C for 100 cycles.

Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF)‐derived bifunctional electrocatalyst toward the ORR and the OER is demonstrated, in which the COF‐derived carbon on carbon nanotubes is used as the support to anchor active bimetal Ni/Fe clusters and nanoparticles. Since Ni/Fe ions are immobilized in the pore channels of the COFs, the aggregation and migration of ions under pyrolysis are effectively hindered. In addition, the COF‐derived carbon‐made catalyst features abundant nitrogen content and a high mesoporous volume. As a result, the catalyst displays ultrahigh ORR activity, with a half‐wave potential of 0.87 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the catalyst achieves a low operating potential of 1.55 V at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , with a Tafel slop of 61 mV decade −1 for OER in 0.1 m KOH, superior to most oxygen electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits remarkable performance in Zn–air batteries. This work demonstrates a new insight into developing bifunctional catalysts from COFs.",

Like all other chemical looping applications, oxygen carriers play key roles in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of CLBP. In addition to the requirement for high oxygen transfer capacity, the chemical activity of the lattice oxygen also needs to be modulated to steer the selectivity of CLBP toward syngas. Furthermore, it is desirable for the CLBP oxygen carriers to possess catalytic activities that accelerate the conversion of biomass‐based feedstocks. However, despite the large volume of relevant research publications, the diversity in oxygen carrier formulations, biomass compositions, and test conditions used leads to mixed views regarding the structural–functional relationships between oxygen carriers and their performance during CLBP. To address the above knowledge gap, this review presents a systematic, but non‐exhaustive summary of the development and evaluation of oxygen carriers for CLBP applications, with an aim to elucidate the rational design principles and operation parameters toward optimal process efficiency.",

The reactions are performed in alkaline aqueous solutions using commercial nickel oxide (NiO) or a mesostructured nickel oxide derived by CMK‐1 templating (NiO‐CMK‐1).

The reuse of 75% of the reaction medium for ten cycles, do not alter the properties of the CNFs either. With this approach, the consumption of TEMPO and NaBr is reduced by 67%, while that of NaClO is decreased by 42% and 22% in the oxidation of cotton and eucalyptus cellulose, respectively. At the same time, the environmental concerns derived from the disposal of the catalysts are considerably reduced.",

However, it is difficult to prepare high‐expansion PLA foam due to the poor melt strength and complex crystallization behavior of PLA. Herein, super high‐expansion PLA foams with excellent oil‐adsorption and thermal‐insulation properties are successfully prepared using a modified supercritical CO 2 foaming technology without introducing eco‐unfriendly chain extenders or fillers. High‐strength melt at low temperature and low‐strength melt at high temperature are used to prepare closed‐cell and open‐cell foams, respectively. The resulting PLA closed‐cell foam with an expansion ratio of 60 shows a thermal conductivity as low as 31.7 mW m −1 k −1 , and the PLA open‐cell foam with an expansion ratio of 43 and exhibits an adsorption capacity of 10.9–31.2 g g −1 for various oils. Based on the prepared PLA foams with tunable structure, the influence of cell structure on the properties of the foam is also studied. Of particular note, reducing the cell size can obviously enhance the surface hydrophobicity of PLA foam. This work provides a green strategy for the preparation of eco‐friendly materials applied in environment protection and energy conservation.",

Photochemical degradation is a major transformation pathway of atmospheric organic matter, which changes the atmospherically related life time and the environmental, climatic, and health‐related effects of organic matter, as well as biogeochemical cycles of elements. In addition to field observations and model simulations, laboratory experiments based on smog chambers and flow tubes are important approaches to study the photodegradation mechanisms and influencing factors of atmospheric organics. Isotopic composition is also a useful tracer for photodegradation processes of different organics, for example, carboxylic acids. In this article, research progress on photodegradation of several significant categories of organic pollutants which have aroused widespread concern currently, for example, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, brown carbon, organosulfates/organonitrates, microplastics, and bioaerosols, are reviewed. The effects of different degradation mechanisms including photochemical reactions, heterogeneous aqueous reactions, and microbial degradation are also compared. Although the photodegradation of atmospheric organics has been studied to a certain extent, much more effort should be made to fill the large knowledge gap between the actual and simulated photodegradation processes.",

This paper explores the tribo‐ and piezo‐electric functionalities of tomato peel (TP) to fabricate a nature‐driven hybrid nanogenerator. Tomato is one of the most cultivated vegetables globally, however, a significant amount of TP is disposed after utilization in the food processing industries. The TP possesses a natural hierarchically placed highly porous structure, which is helpful to enhance the output performance of both piezo‐ and tribo‐electric devices. This work shows that a TP based piezo‐electric nanogenerator can produce an open circuit voltage of 24.5 V, short circuit current of 2.5 µA, and maximum instantaneous power of 19.5 µW. In addition, the TP based tribo‐electric nanogenerator generates open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and instantaneous power of 135 V, 81 µA, and 3750 µW, respectively. Combining two NGs functionalities, the proposed TP based tribo‐ and piezo‐electric nanogenerator (TP‐TPENG) shows enhanced output performance with the rectified open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and maximum instantaneous power of 150 V, 84 µA, and 5400 µW, respectively.

In this work, a sulfonated phenothiazine‐based HTM is reported, namely TAS, which consists of a butterfly structure with a readily synthesized N ,​ N ‐​bis[4‐​(methylthio)​phenyl]​aniline side functional group. The interaction between TAS and perovskite via Pb–S bond induces a dipole moment that deepens the valence band of perovskite and thereby leads to enhanced open‐circuit voltage in corresponding n‐i‐p PSCs. More importantly, the functionalization of perovskite surface via Pb–S bond promotes the hole extraction reaction while suppressing the interfacial non‐radiative recombination, contributing to a 20–50% performance improvement compared to less‐ (4‐​(methylthio)​‐​ N ‐​[4‐​(methylthio)​phenyl]​aniline, DAS) or non‐interacting ( N , N ‐bis(4‐methoxyphenyl)aniline, TAO) counterparts.

The successful copolymerization of the IBA in g‐CN (g‐CN/IBA) is easily identified by 13 C NMR spectra, Fourier transformed infrared spectra, and UV–vis absorption spectra. As a result, the acquired copolymer composites exhibit greatly enhanced visible‐light photocatalytic performance for H 2 evolution, in comparison with the undoped g‐CN. The g‐CN‐IBA photocatalyst with the optimal loading amounts of NiS displays an outstanding hydrogen‐evolution rate of 2948.52 µmol g ‐1 h ‐1 under visible light (λ &gt; 420 nm). The maximum apparent quantum efficiency of g‐CN/IBA‐3%NiS is 3.20% at 450 nm. The enhanced activity can be attributed to the synergism of edge grafting of 4‐(1H‐Imidazol‐2‐yl) benzoic acid and loading of NiS cocatalysts, which not only shows a remarkable redshift of the optical‐absorption compared to g‐CN, effectively improving the absorption in the visible range, but also effectively avoids recombination and drives the favorable separation of photogenerated carriers in plane. This work provides a protocol for simultaneously increasing the active sites of light absorption and surface reactions of g‐CN‐based photocatalysts to maximize photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.",

Herein, for the first time the electrochemical properties of a vanadium‐based fluoroxide, β‐KVOF 3 , as a cathode for LIBs, are reported. After optimization, a reversible capacity as high as 274 mAh g −1 , a stable 300 cycles lifetime, and an energy density comparable to LiFePO 4 (650 vs 550 Wh kg −1 ) are achieved. Experiments and simulation study of reaction mechanism illustrate that such performance originates from the reversible V 3+ /V 5+ redox reaction, high structural stability of β‐KVOF 3 , and the pseudocapacitive process during charging and discharging. This study reveals that β‐KVOF 3 is a promising cathode for Li‐ion storage and provides a new design idea for developing high‐performance LIBs cathode materials.",

It is hypothesized that functional groups on biochar surfaces enhance interactions between biochar and bitumen constituents. This in turn enhances mechanical properties and durability of asphalt pavements. This study uses biochars derived from six different types of woody biomass and one type of algae, and polyethylene terephthalate granules as a carrier to introduce biochar to bitumen. Quantum‐based molecular modeling and noncovalent interaction analysis show that algal biochar interacts more effectively with bitumen components. The enhanced interaction of algal biochar is attributed to its surface functional groups including reactive nitrogen‐ and oxygen‐carrying functional groups. The rheological characterization of bitumen doped with different biochars confirms that the lowest separation index occurs for bitumen containing algal biochar, which also exhibits the highest percent of elastic recovery and resistance to permanent deformation. The study suggests that asphalt pavement durability can be enhanced by selection of the proper biochar to increase intermolecular interactions. Promising results for the algae biochar promote its use in carbon management for roadway infrastructure by sequestering CO 2 from air through photosynthesis of algae biomass.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The hydrogenation of CO 2 to methanol has been studied by several researchers owing to its two significant merits, namely, mitigation of CO 2 emissions and production of renewable fuel. Consequently, numerous experiments have been reported for carbon‐neutral methanol synthesis over copper‐based catalysts over the past few years. However, it is very expensive and time‐consuming to always observe reaction changes with respect to input parameters (operating conditions and catalytic properties) experimentally. Herein, this study develops an ultrafast machine learning (ML) based framework to predict CO 2 conversion and methanol selectivity by comprehensive knowledge extraction (extensive database construction) from existing published literature. Among various ML algorithms, artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit best accuracy with R 2 test values of 0.885 and 0.861 for CO 2 conversion and methanol selectivity, respectively. Subsequently, the efficacy and fidelity of developed neural networks are depicted by satisfactory performance ( R 2 ≥ 0.80) for majority of unseen test datasets (literature‐based as well as the experimental dataset for Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst). Finally, this work concludes that this ML‐based concept allows to uncover catalytic property–performance correlations hidden in large body of existing experimental research. This offers an open and generic platform for a major breakthrough of ML in heterogeneous catalysis which can help in planning future experiments.",

Herein, chitosan is employed with the accordion‐like multilayered mMXene (mMXene) to fabricate the 3D thermally insulated and low‐cost composites using melamine foam (MF) as a template. The obtained MF/CHT/mMXene (MCM) composites with different mass ratios of mMXene/chitosan are then subject to a simple annealing treatment at 500 °C for 2 h to afford 3D and self‐floating carbonized carbonized MF/CHT/mMXene (CMCM) composites. The CMCM‐1 obtained with mass ratio of CHT/mMXene at 1:1 displays low thermal conductivity, high hydrophilicity, and good light absorbance. When it is utilized as the evaporator of pure water and seawater, its evaporation rates can reach at 1.554 and 1.428 kg m −2 h −1 under 1 kW m −2 irradiation and the photothermal conversion efficiency can reach at 89.8%. In addition, the CMCM‐1 composite also displays excellent desalination ability, self‐desalination ability, good cycle stability, and reliable safety performance. Combining these advantages, CMCM‐1 composite may have potential practical applications for seawater evaporation and wastewater treatment, etc.",

This study investigates the synergetic effect of tetraethylene pentamine‐functionalized reduce graphene oxide (rGO‐TEPA) and barium strontium titanate (BST) pillars on tribopositive and tribonegative layers, respectively. The surface potentials of pristine polyurethane (PU) and Ecoflex (EC0) increases by 2.2 (from 203 to 439 V) and 2.1 (from−848 to −1813 V) times their initial values by embedding 5 wt.% of rGO‐TEPA and 10 wt.% of BST, respectively. The optimized 2 wt.% of rGO‐TEPA loaded PU/5wt.% of BST loaded EC‐TENG (PU2/EC5‐TENG) produce a maximum open circuit potential (V OC ) of 440 V, short circuit current (I SC ) of 11.2 µA, and surface charge (Q) of 87 nC when employing a 12.5 N load at a frequency of 5 Hz. The PU2/EC5‐TENG shows an output performance (V OC ) ≈2.7 times higher than PU/EC0‐TENG, revealing the capability of the rGO‐TEPA and BST pillars to enhance the performance of TENGs. The optimized PU2/EC5‐TENG shows a maximum power density of 0.58 Wm −2 at 70 MΩ and demonstrate real‐time applications such as lighting LEDs (100 no's) and low‐power LCD display (stopwatch).

Poly (L‐lactic acid) (PLLA) is a bio‐based piezoelectric polymer and has important research value. To optimize the properties of materials, electrospinning technology is used for preparing nanofiber films by combining PLLA with CO 2 ‐based polyurea (PU) synthesized from CO 2 and diamine, and assembling the piezoelectric sensors. The results show that when the amount of PU is 16 wt%, the voltage of the PU/PLLA piezoelectric sensor is 19 V, which is 15 times that of the PLLA piezoelectric sensor and has good stability and durability. The high dipole moment of NHCONH in PU and the synergistic effect between PU and PLLA are the keys to improving the piezoelectric property of nanofiber film. This is the first report on the preparation of composite piezoelectric materials using CO 2 ‐based polymer and PLLA.

These Li‐PRBs, due to their lightweight and low‐cost, offers various advantages compared to conventional combination of solar cells and a battery. Single active material‐based PRBs have gained attention due to the use of multifunctional materials which perform both solar energy harvesting and storage, however most of the PRBs studied so far are based on ion intercalation. Herein, the use of conversion type active material α ‐Fe 2 O 3 for efficient and stable operation of Li‐PRBs is demonstrated.

Li‐PRB has shown photoconversion and storage efficiency of ≈1.988% when illuminated with blue LED ( λ ex ≈ 470 nm) for large voltage window (0.8–2.57 V).

Supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) is a gas separation technology that relies on the reversible charge and discharge of supercapacitor electrodes to absorb and desorb CO 2 highly selectively and reversibly. However, thus far SSA only showed low sorption capacity, and slow sorption kinetics. Herein, it is shown that the sorption capacity can be substantially increased via the use of carbons with a higher specific capacitance. The highest gravimetric sorption capacity is measured with electrodes made from garlic‐roots derived activated carbon valuing 273 mmol kg −1 having a specific capacitance of 257 F g −1 . In addition, the overall adsorption rate and productivity are improved. Cycling the electrodes for over 100 h showed highly reproducible, reversible CO 2 adsorption and desorption behavior.

Specifically, interspersed polydiacetylene‐anthraquinone/polyaniline (PANI) electrodes are prepared via drop‐casting and used as cathodes in devices employing polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide anodes using aqueous or ionic liquid electrolytes. The excellent electrochemical properties of the polydiacetylene‐anthraquinone/PANI electrodes, specifically high capacitance (specific capacitance ≈720 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ), long discharge time, and cycling stability, are ascribed to the superior redox profile of the anthraquinone and ambipolar charge transport associated with the polydiacetylene framework.

Hence, in this study, oxygen‐doped g‐C 3 N 4 containing trace amounts of halogen in the structures for piezo‐photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxides (H 2 O 2 ) is fabricated. The findings reveal that oxygen atoms may be inserted into g‐C 3 N 4 in‐plane structures, while halogen atoms tend to become intercalated between g‐C 3 N 4 layers. Furthermore, the presence of ammonium molten salts (NH 4 X) during the synthesis alters the concentration of mono and cluster vacancies of carbon and nitrogen in the materials, certifying by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). These defective contributions will be meaningfully accelerate catalytic performance by providing trapping states. Additionally, the decomposition of generated H 2 O 2 can produce highly oxidative hydroxyl radicals, inducing degradations on the catalyst's structures and unexpectedly decreasing catalytic outcomes. From the mechanistic view, different reduction and oxidation channels will be play a pivotal role in generating H 2 O 2 . Moreover, the influence of ultrasound and light is also carefully investigated in the work to gain more insights into how the catalysts are triggered to improve catalytic performance.

The formation of LIG material is revealed by structural and morphological characterization using various analyses, including Raman spectroscopy, X‐ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The electrical analyses are conducted to measure the resulting sheet resistance, getting results as low as 31 Ω sq −1 .

Herein, it is shown that wool is a promising natural material for transferring mid‐infrared human body radiation, but the high absorption in the solar spectrum prohibits wool from achieving satisfactory daytime radiative cooling. Thus the natural wool impregnates zinc ions into the protein chains to form a zinc‐ion woolen (wool‐Zn) fabric. The wool‐Zn fabric can provide humans with a cooling sensation both indoors and daytime outdoors, showing a temperature reduction of 2 °C on human skin indoors and a reduction of 7 °C on artificial skin under direct sunlight, respectively, when covered by wool‐Zn fabrics compared to when covered with cotton. Moreover, the wool‐Zn fabric shows desirable antibacterial properties and durability against washing and abrasion, while maintaining desirable wearability. As a result, the wool‐Zn fabric shows great potential for commercial application in personal thermoregulation and provides an effective avenue toward sustainable energy and environment.",

This atom is primarily bonded to the carrier surface through hetero‐atom bonding. It is important to note that the coordination environment of the metal atoms may not be the same when each dispersed active metal atom has an identical coordination environment on the carrier's surface. The utilization of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) doesn't strictly imply that a solitary metal atom with zero valency functions as the active core. Singular atoms can also engage in distant interactions with other atoms or clusters of atoms on the substrate, like electron transfer, and frequently demonstrate specific charges. The main reason for the high activity of the catalyst is the remote (i.e., long‐range) interaction of the active atom with the surrounding coordination atoms. For this reason, the study of the mechanism of long‐range interactions between multiple single‐atom sites and between single‐atom sites and atomic cluster sites has become an important and urgent task in the design and regulation of single‐atom catalyst performance.",

The use of an acidic medium, which can boost the charge storage capacity of spinel oxides offering an additional channel of intercalation‐deintercalation of protons, is underexplored. Moreover, the impact of chemical compositions and the cationic distributions is crucial on the electrocatalysis performance of spinel oxides, however, such a correlation is first time reported for charge storage properties of spinel ferrite NiFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles (NFO NPs).

A flexible all‐solid‐state asymmetric device (full‐cell) configuration depicts impressive energy density (20.7 Wh kg −1 ), power density (4000 W kg −1 ), gravimetric capacitance (140 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 ), and retention of its performance (≈75% after 10,000 charging/discharging cycles). The results depict a new insight toward the tuning of electronic and charge storage properties in NFO, which otherwise are predominately attributed to only the crystallite size and morphological effects.",

Herein, fabricated a novel 3‐aminopropyltriethoxysilane (core) and 2,2‐bis(hydroxymethyl)butyric acid (monomer)‐based hyperbranched polyester by facile single‐step polycondensation technique generation 2 (Si‐HBP‐G2). Further, a new class of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and different weight percentages (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%) of Si‐HBP‐G2 hybrid fiber blends are prepared by traditional electrospinning technique. The as‐prepared Si‐HBP‐G2 and its blends are well characterized using SEM/EDS, FTIR, NMR, and XRD studies. The influence of Si‐HBP‐G2 content on triboelectric performance in terms of the open circuit potential (V OC ) and short circuit current (I SC ) is evaluated using aluminum (Al) as a counter electrode. Among them, 15 wt% of Si‐HBP‐G2/PVDF hybrid fiber mat (PG2‐15) exhibits superior electrical performance. Which is almost increased 5.9 times (22–130 V) of V OC and 4.9 times (0.71–3.5 µA) of I SC than PVDF fiber mate. These results reveal the significance of Si‐HBP‐G2 in the triboelectric performance. The optimized TENG device (PG2‐15/Al‐TENG) exhibits a peak power density of 0.2 Wm −2 at 100 MΩ external load. Finally, the PG2‐15/Al‐TENG practically demonstrates real‐time application energy harvesting applications such as powering 100 LEDs and a stopwatch.",

This study explores the utilization of avocado pruning residue (APR) for isolating lignocellulose fibers and their application as replacement and reinforcement material for bio‐based polyethylene (BioPE) composites.

However, salts will accumulate on the surface of the photothermal conversion structure during seawater desalination, which hinders solar energy absorption. Meanwhile, the photothermal conversion structure directly immersing in a large water body results in a large heat dissipation loss. Both factors impair solar energy conversion and water steam generation. To address the issues, inspired by a ginseng plant (with a trunk‐to‐branch water supply system), a 3D cotton‐based photothermal evaporator with tunable water supply is facilely designed herein via simple cloak‐weaving of a porphyrin‐based conjugated microporous polymer (PPCMP) as the photothermal conversion material. The as‐designed 3D cloak‐like photothermal evaporator achieves an equilibrium between the water supply flux and evaporation rate via optimizing PPCMP weaving and the water path. As a result, a high evaporation rate of 2.81 kg m −2 h −1 and photothermal conversion efficiency of 155% are obtained under 1 sun illumination. The findings underline the importance of 3D porous organic polymer‐based fabrics as effective media for harnessing solar energy and highlight their potential for seawater desalination.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bioplastics offer a solution to the problem of increasing atmospheric CO 2 levels contributed by the linear production and consumption pattern of fossil‐derived plastics by closing the carbon loop with material sourcing from biomass and bioplastic's biodegradability. Spirulina, a genus of cyanobacteria that is capable of rapid CO 2 uptake, can be the key to realizing a circular plastic economy by converting atmospheric CO 2 to value‐added high protein content biomass, from which the protein can be extracted and processed to produce protein‐based bioplastics with high captured carbon content that is biodegradable, releasing CO 2 after decomposition to be returned to the cycle. To demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the self‐assembling capabilities of Spirulina protein to fabricate bioplastics, a simple procedure is proposed that involves protein isoelectric point precipitation followed by solvent casting to produce an entirely Spirulina protein‐based bioplastic film containing glycerol as the plasticizer without blending with other types of conventional plastics. By further crosslinking with carboxymethylcellulose and Ca 2+ cations, are able to obtain films with the highest average tensile strength of 5.5MPa. Additionally, the Spirulina protein films showed potential in UV‐blocking applications and exhibited good biodegradability.",

The electrode is comprised of nickel phosphides encapsulated by phosphorus‐doped carbon shells, showing simultaneous “superaerophilic” and “superhydrophobic” domains on the surfaces with an underwater N 2 contact angle of 13.4° and water contact angle of 140.7°. Through mechanism studies combining molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, it shows the superaerophilic domains that contribute to enriching N 2 at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces for favorable gas feedstock supply, while superhydrophobic domains suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution. Benefit from the directly trapping N 2 molecules, the electrode drives right shift of the reaction equilibrium with substantially increased Faradic efficiency up to 42.4%, rating it among the most efficient nitrogen electrofixation catalysts in aqueous electrolytes. The present finding is expected to provide an additional dimension to biomimetic mechanisms that manipulate systems beyond traditional constraint.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ammonia is vital for industries, especially agriculture, where it is used in fertilizers to boost crop yields. Globally, about 176 million tons of ammonia is produced annually. Its synthesis relies on the Haber–Bosch process, which is energy‐intensive (, 150 atm) and environmentally unsustainable. This has sparked considerable interest in developing alternative, more sustainable approaches for nitrogen fixation. One promising area of research is plasmonics. Plasmonics explores light interaction with nanomaterials, traditionally using noble metals like gold and silver, which are costly and scarce for large‐scale use. Alternative materials such as bismuth, aluminum, and metal oxides exhibit plasmonics, providing a more sustainable and affordable solution for industrial applications. Recent research have focused on optimizing these non‐noble metal plasmonic materials for sustainable nitrogen fixation. This review offers in‐depth understanding of plasmonics in both noble and non‐noble metals. The review then delves into the mechanisms of photocatalytic processes, particularly hot carrier generation, offering insights into their role in enhancing catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, the review highlights cutting‐edge research on photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, emphasizing the use of alternative plasmonic materials as a sustainable approach to ammonia synthesis. Finally, it identifies challenges, suggests solutions, and sets the stage for advancing plasmonic photocatalysis.",

Notably, Au/ZnO‐NF demonstrates exceptional cycling stability surpassing most of the currently reported catalysts, maintaining a glycerol conversion of 75.2% and a DHA selectivity of 75.1% even after five cycles. Comprehensive characterization and experimental analysis demonstrat that the Au/ZnO‐NF catalysts exhibit low reduction temperatures, the smallest Au nanoparticle size, excellent crystallinity, and significantly enhance adsorption of O 2 and the adsorption and conversion of polyols at glycerol secondary hydroxyl moiety.",

Comprehensive characterizations confirm the successful formation of graphene films with uniform thickness of 3–10 layers and with high structural integrity while showcasing a resistivity of 3.52·10 −4 Ω.cm.

The physico‐chemical and textural properties of PNCs are tailored by combining pyrolysis temperatures up to 1200 °C and the use or not of KOH or K 2 CO 3 as activating agents. The physico‐chemical and structural properties of these carbocatalysts are correlated with their catalytic activities. The PNC catalyst pyrolized at 1200 °C for 4 h using K 2 CO 3 (PNC1200‐4K 2 CO 3 ) provides a complete pollutant degradation after 150 min, while PNC catalyst pyrolized at 1200 °C for 4 h without activation requires 300 min. PNC1200‐4K 2 CO 3 performance compares favorably with previous reports. The superior catalytic activity of this reusable catalyst is attributed to its highest population of π‐extended aromatic domains as active sites together with high porosity. The catalytic formation of 1 O 2 , HO . and HOO . radicals are supported by electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and selective quenching experiments. Unlike most of the previous analogous reports, herein, we demonstrate that 1 O 2 in the presence of PNC1200‐4K 2 CO 3 can degrade oxalic acid even in the presence of common radical scavengers.",

However, the reaction efficiency of photocatalysis is restricted by the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and although it is promising under solar light illumination conditions, it remains challenging because of the seasonal variations, weather conditions, and diurnal cycles. Alternatively, piezo catalysis, transferring mechanical to chemical energy, is vital for environmental cleansing and energy regeneration. Therefore, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with a MgAl layered double hydroxide and graphene oxide (GO) is prepared herein for efficient piezo‐photocatalytic.

Direct membrane filtration (DMF) using ultrafiltration provides a low‐energy alternative for recovering organics, which are utilized for energy recovery through anaerobic digestion (AD). However, DMF faces challenges from membrane fouling and elevated dissolved organics in the permeate. To address these issues, this study implements biological contact tank pre‐treatment before DMF, with a short hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 60 min. This pre‐treatment selectively removes 62% of dissolved organics without compromising the recovery of suspended or colloidal organic matter and enhances permeate quality by 40% in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD). The DMF system without pre‐treatment exhibits 1.84 times higher irreversible pore‐blocking membrane resistance, with higher foulant concentrations per membrane unit area (up to 2.54 times) and enzymatic activity (up to 3.04 times). The recovered organics undergo AD, yielding methane up to 336 ± 23 mL‐CH 4 /g‐VS, making the DMF system net energy positive.

The resulting hybrid nanocomposites (PN7/Z‐0.1, PN7/Z‐0.3, PN7/Z‐0.5, PN7/Z‐0.7) are characterized by SEM, XRD, and FT‐IR, confirming effective nanoparticle integration. Among them, PN7/Z‐0.5 exhibits the highest β‐phase content and superior triboelectric performance. The PN7/Z‐0.5:TPU TENG, with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as the tribo‐positive layer, achieves an open‐circuit voltage (V OC ) of 158.4 V, short‐circuit current (I SC ) of 4.8 µA, surface charge density of 89 nC, and a surface potential of −475 V, which is substantially outperforming pristine PVDF:TPU TENGs. Additionally, the optimized TENG successfully powered capacitors and green LEDs, demonstrating its potential for practical, sustainable energy applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tungsten oxide‐based photoelectrodes for solar supercapacitor applications are initially prepared by screen printing. After a complete functional characterization, the obtained results show the ability of these films to increase the number of stored charges when illuminated due to a diffusion mechanism and finally to produce an areal capacitance of 1.6 and 0.7 mF cm −2 under illumination or in the dark, respectively. Decorating the as‐produced electrodes by inkjet printing allowed us to increase their exposed surface area, thus enhancing the areal capacitance up to 2.2 mF cm −2 while reducing charge‐transfer resistances. Finally, gel‐state symmetrical devices with agar‐agar‐based electrolyte are prepared and tested with different illumination intensities. At high illumination (1000 W m −2 ), an areal capacitance of 2.5 mF cm −2 is recorded, however, at low illumination conditions (500 W m −2 ), the highest value of 7.9 mF cm −2 is obtained (at 0.3 mA cm −2 ) due to reduced recombination phenomena between the photogenerated charges and the applied current density. This work demonstrates the potentiality of WO 3 as a bifunctional material for solar rechargeable supercapacitors, paving the way for the development of new fully integrated devices for the energy sector.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Advanced Materials (AdMa) play a crucial role for numerous strategies that address global challenges. They are being developed fast, making it increasingly challenging for regulation to keep pace with innovation. Existing frameworks, which are either not designed for AdMa or lack adequate filtering to identify AdMa of high concern, do not (yet) effectively support regulatory preparedness. The HARMLESS Early Warning System (EWS), in contrast, is a practically applicable tool for screening plenty of materials in a reasonable time. It is organized in two tiers, each underpinned by a specific methodology and facilitated by a dedicated online tool. The initial Tier 0 categorizes the materials using the Advanced Materials Earliest Assessment (AMEA) tool. Tier 1 first screens materials asking only 15 questions and is ideal for data‐poor materials at early innovation stages. These questions cover issues related to human/ environmental exposure and hazard, sustainability and applicability of existing regulations. In a more elaborated version, experimental testing based on New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) is suggested. As outcome, the user is provided with 1) material‐related concerns, 2) prioritization of AdMa and 3) recommendations for (regulatory) follow‐up actions. Data from two industrial case studies is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the HARMLESS EWS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, an approach is used to emulate the principles of nature‐inspired engineering for the photodegradation of antibiotics. A bioinspired photocatalyst of Chlorophyll‐Carbon dots (Chl‐CDs) decorated WS 2 /MIL‐53(Fe) nanocomposite was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The nanocomposite showed significantly enhanced visible light absorption due to the presence of Chl‐CDs dots with excitation‐dependent emission behavior, attributed to distinct surface states and functional groups. The average lifetime of photogenerated electron‐hole pairs increased by ∼6 times compared to pure WS 2 which is responsible for more efficient charge separation. Furthermore, the surface area of the nanocomposite was found to be 16 times higher than WS 2 , providing abundant active sites for the photocatalytic reaction. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated through the degradation of Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Sulfasalazine (SZ), with the Chl‐CDs/WS 2 /MIL‐53(Fe) nanocomposite achieving 90–100% degradation of SZ and SMX in 90 minutes. Electron‐Paramagnetic‐Resonance spectroscopy (EPR) confirmed the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the degradation pathway was elucidated using Liquid Chromatography‐Mass Spectroscopy (LCMS). The improved performance can be attributed to the enhanced charge separation, increased surface area, and the Z‐scheme mechanism. This study represents the promising potential of the novel ternary Chl‐CDs/WS 2 /MIL‐53(Fe) nanocomposite for efficient photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants from water.",

In this study, Ag particles are first incorporated into PEDOT:PSS ink to produce PEDOT:PSS/Ag composite electrode materials, which are then used to construct paper‐based flexible supercapacitors via a scalable screen‐printing technique. Benefiting from the improved electrical property and surface morphology, the areal capacitance of the supercapacitor based on PEDOT:PSS/Ag composite electrodes is found to be 3.87 times greater than that of the pure PEDOT:PSS electrode. Moreover, the paper‐based supercapacitor also exhibits exceptional flexibility, maintaining over 80% of its initial capacitance even after 9000 bending cycles. These findings indicate that PEDOT:PSS/Ag composite electrodes are promising candidates for high‐performance flexible supercapacitors, highlighting their potential to supply continuous power for application in future flexible electronics.",

However, achieving sufficient power output at low magnetic field intensities (≤ 1.0 Oe) remains a challenge for the continuous operation of IoT sensors. To address this limitation, an MME generator is developed featuring dual piezoelectric single crystal macro‐fiber composites (SFCs), strategically applying two stress‐concentrated regions created by heavy tip‐end and middle magnets in a cantilever structure. This design produced a total root mean square power output of 0.326 mW·cm −3· Oe −2 at an optimal load resistance under a low magnetic field intensity of 1.0 Oe. Remarkably, even under an extremely low magnetic field intensity of 0.1 Oe, the harvested energy sustained the continuous operation of a temperature/humidity sensor and enabled the reliable performance of multi‐functional IoT sensors capable of monitoring temperature, humidity, and sound. This research not only presents an effective design for harvesting energy from low‐level magnetic fields but also highlights the practicality of MME generators within IoT‐enabled wireless sensor networks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The imperative for cost‐effective, robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for green hydrogen production aligns with the pressing need to valorize the growing stream of spent lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). Addressing this dual challenge, this study demonstrates the direct utilization of extensively cycled lithium cobalt oxide (C‐LCO) from these spent LIBs as a high‐performance OER electrocatalyst, circumventing conventional pre‐treatments. The resultant C‐LCO exhibits markedly superior OER activity and favorable reaction kinetics when compared to its pristine counterpart. This enhanced performance is attributed to synergistic modifications induced by its electrochemical history: an increased active surface area, partial surface transformation into a spinel‐like structure, significant lithium deficiency, and a higher cobalt oxidation state. Crucially, density functional theory calculations corroborate these experimental observations, identifying lithium vacancies within the surface spinel phase as pivotal. These vacancies, in turn, optimize the material's electronic structure by modulating the Co d‐band center, which leads to near‐ideal OER intermediate binding and a dramatically reduced theoretical overpotential. Consequently, this research unveils a novel, sustainable strategy to transform LIB waste into valuable OER electrocatalysts. Beyond this practical application, it offers fundamental insights into the self‐optimizing effects of electrochemical cycling, signifying a substantial advancement in repurposing spent LIBs for clean energy technologies.",

The NC@CNFs are used as robust fibrous adsorption materials for CO 2 capture, which achieve superior CO 2 uptake of 6.3 mmol g −1 at 1.0 bar and 298 K, as well as remarkable CO 2 /N 2 selectivity and excellent cyclability. Integrating NC into CNFs not only brings number of adsorption sites (i.e., NH 2 ) and tunable hierarchical pores for CO 2 uptake, but also serves as single‐fiber‐crack connection to prevent NC@CNFs from brittle fracture. More significantly, the flexible NC@CNFs with highly stable structure and mechanical strength can overcome the limitation of easy pulverization and structure collapses for traditional particle‐shaped solid sorbents, which makes them highly operable and applicable.

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern society is in great need of environmentally sustainable and low‐cost alternatives to some petroleum derived adhesives. To allow recycling and avoid pollution, adhesives for single use products including packaging are of particular interest. Potential candidates for such applications are the adhesive formulations of corn zein protein and tannic acid presented here. High strength adhesive bonding is found when the formulations are optimized with regard to composition, pH, and curing temperature. Bonding is tested on aluminum substrates using lap shear configurations. Adhesion strengths exceed the minimal bonding of zein‐only controls. Maximum adhesion for zein and tannic acid is as strong as commercial Super Glue when measured under similar conditions. The system forms nanometer and micrometer sized pores throughout the bulk adhesive. A low amount of tannic acid and neutral pH of the strongest adhesive make the corn zein–tannic acid system potentially appealing for cost efficient adhesives used in packaging, cosmetics, and other single use applications where biomedical grade purity is not required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar photovoltaic technologies could fully deploy and impact the energy conversion systems in our society if mass‐produced energy‐storage solutions exist. A supercapacitor can regulate the fluctuations on the electrical grid on short time scales. Their mass‐implementation requires the use of abundant materials, biological and organic synthetic materials are attractive because of atomic element abundancy and low‐temperature synthetic processes. Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) coming from the forest industry is exploited as a three‐dimensional template to control the transport of ions in an electrolyte‐separator, with nanochannels filled of aqueous electrolyte. The nanochannels are defined by voids in the nanocomposite made of NFC and the proton transporting polymer polystyrene sulfonic acid PSSH. The ionic conductivity of NFC‐PSSH composites (0.2 S cm –1 at 100% relative humidity) exceeds sea water in a material that is solid, feel dry to the finger, but filled of nanodomains of water. A paper‐based supercapacitor made of NFC‐PSSH electrolyte‐separator sandwiched between two paper‐based electrodes is demonstrated. Although modest specific capacitance (81.3 F g –1 ), power density (2040 W kg –1 ) and energy density (1016 Wh kg –1 ), this is the first conceptual demonstration of a supercapacitor based on cellulose in each part of the device; which motivates the search for using paper manufacturing as mass‐production of energy‐storage devices.",

From the wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and positron annihilation spectroscopy (PALS), two opposing structural effects of CA incorporation on polymer chains are found, with one being expansive for fractional free volume (FFV) and the other contractive. The bulky cup‐shape CA cavity reduces the chain packing efficiency, which increases FFV and the gas permeability, but the smaller dihedral angle of CA shrinks FFV, leading to the enhanced gas selectivity. More interestingly, CA's unique 3D open cavities also favor selective passage of gas molecules. These combinative effects impart PIM‐CA copolymer membranes with attractive and tunable gas transport properties. The gas permeability improves dominantly at small CA loadings while the selectivity is enhanced significantly at higher loadings, allowing PIM‐CA membranes with ≥1% CA loadings to perform beyond 2008 Robeson upper bounds for H 2 /N 2 , H 2 /CH 4 , CO 2 /N 2 , and CO 2 /CH 4 separations. As a cheap commercial product with high chemical versatility, CA can expand the spectrum of PIM‐based membrane designs for more efficient hydrogen and natural gas purification processes.",

Here, a simple and scalable strategy is developed for fabricating green, W&amp;B, polyurethane nanofibrous membranes based on an ethanol solvent via emulsion electrospinning and post thermal treatment. A novel ethanol‐soluble and spinnable polyurethane is synthesized by a stepwise polymerization reaction. Notably, green nanofibrous membranes with high hydrophobicity are obtained based on fluorinated polyurethane/ethanol emulsions, utilizing the synthesized polyurethane as the template polymer. Furthermore, the introduction of the aziridine crosslinker (tris (2‐methyl‐1‐aziridine propionate) (TTMA)) constructs the structure by post thermal treatment between TTMA and ethanol‐soluble polyurethane, resulting in the exceptional ethanol resistance of the nanofibrous membranes. The resulting membranes present integrated functionalities of a robust hydrostatic pressure of 86.2 kPa, high water vapor permeability of 13.1 kg m −2 d −1 , good air permeability of 5.5 mm s −1 , low mass‐loss rate of 8.6 wt% after 60 min ethanol immersion, and desirable elasticity with a strain recovery ratio of 79.2%, offering strong potential for the next generation green and nontoxic protective textiles.",

Looking at the common challenges for these different systems, scientists in basic research should carefully consider commercial requirements when designing new materials. These include cost and ease of synthesis, abundance of precursors, recyclability of spent devices, toxicity, and stability. Improvements in these areas deserve more attention, as they can help bridge the gap for these technologies and facilitate the creation of partnerships between academia and industry. These improvements should be pursued in parallel with the design of novel compositions, nanostructures, and devices, which have led most interest during the past decade.

The electrochemical measurements show that if the W 1.33 C MXene is subjected to high cathodic potentials, it greatly improves the activity and onset potential for the HER. The enhancement continues to improve independent of whether the potential is kept fixed at a certain cathodic potential or if the potential is scanned repeatedly. Interestingly, the improvement disappears if the material is subjected to anodic potential. Based on these observations, the hydrogen interaction with the MXene surface as well as in the vacancies is investigated by means of first‐principles calculations. These show that the adsorption energy of hydrogen is sensitive to both surface coverage and vacancy occupancy, and that, for certain structures with hydrogen in the vacancies, thermoneutral values of hydrogen adsorption can be obtained. Based on the calculations it is argued that under high cathodic potentials, protons can transfer to the vacancies and stay there in a metastable state as hydrogen atoms, while at anodic potential the process is reversed. The first‐principles results provide a rationale for the strongly enhanced HER activity observed experimentally on W 1.33 C MXene.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Paper‐based electronics have recently emerged as a simple, biodegradable, and low‐cost paradigm for disposable electronics and may be an excellent way to reduce the dramatic increase in electronic waste. Paper‐based batteries are imperative for stand‐alone and self‐sustained paper‐based electronics. Ideally, paper‐based batteries must be simple, biodegradable, inexpensive, and provide realistic and accessible power. Among many paper‐based batteries, paper‐based microbial biobatteries attract significant attention because of their self‐sustainability, cost‐effectiveness, eco‐friendliness, and potential for energy accessibility in resource‐constrained settings. However, the promise of this technology has not translated into practical power applications because of its low performance. Furthermore, its biodegradability remains questionable. In this work, an easily biodegradable paper‐polymer substrate is engineered as a part of a novel, high‐performance microbial battery. Poly (amic) acid and poly(pyromellitic dianhydride‐p‐phenylenediamine) are processed and incorporated into a porous, hydrophilic network of intertwined cellulose fibers to revolutionize oxygen‐blocking, proton‐exchanging, and biodegrading properties of the paper‐based microbial biobatteries, which ultimately offer the transformative potential of “green” electronics. Furthermore, the battery, formed by adding engineered polymers to the paper, exhibits a much higher power‐to‐cost ratio than all previously reported paper‐based microbial batteries. The biobattery clearly biodegrades without the requirements of special facilities, conditions, or introduction of other microorganisms.",

An air‐source heat pump boiler that can extract thermal energy from air and generate high‐temperature steam is proposed, developed, and verified. The air‐source heat pump boiler shows a stable system output with ambient temperature variations from 5 to 35 °C, with an energy efficiency as high as 150–210% to generate steam at more than 120 °C. Furthermore, by taking technical and economic analysis and carbon trading into consideration, air‐source heat pump boiler has shown significant application advantages than other boilers. This research shows that air‐source heat pump steam generation is feasible for replacing coal‐fired boilers in China and could be a sustainable steam generation method.",

However, the fabrication of these oil–water separation membranes usually needs a complex chemical treatment process. In this study, a facile and green method to fabricate bacterial cellulose membranes (BCMs) with superwettability through one‐step filtration process without any further tedious and costly chemical modification for efficient oil–water separation is proposed. Owing to the ultrafine (20–80 nm in diameter) nanofiber structure and intrinsic hydrophilicity of bacterial cellulose (BC), BCMs with a 3D web‐like structure show superhydrophilicity in air (water contact angles about 0°) and underwater superoleophobicity (oils contact angles &gt;150°). During the oil–water separation process, water permeates through BCMs quickly while oils remain at the BCMs' upper side. Furthermore, all separation processes present high separation efficiency (&gt;99.7%) and high fluxes. In addition, two different models are proposed to describe the formation and microstructure of BCMs and how it affect the separation process. Thus, this work provides a facile and environment benign route for obtaining excellent separation membranes for oil‐polluted‐water treatment.",

Challenges for the luminescent layer include the use of abundant and sustainable natural organic molecules. Here, LSCs composed of a glass container and based on bundles of cylindrical hollow‐core plastic optical fibers filled with aqueous solutions of R‐phycoerythrin (R‐PE), extracted from Gracilaria sp. algae are presented. The R‐PE solutions absorb in the UV/visible spectral range (300–550 nm) and convert this radiation into red‐emission (550–700 nm) with a maximum absolute quantum yield of ≈0.39. In this work, LSCs with distinct geometries are reported, in which the R‐PE emission yields optical conversion efficiency values up to ≈6.88% and ≈4.74% for a planar device and for a bundle of cylindrical LSCs, respectively, which are the largest values known for liquid‐based LCSs using sustainable emitting centres. Moreover, the coupling of the LSCs to commercial Si‐based PV devices yields power conversion efficiency values of ≈0.27% (planar) and ≈23.03 × 10 −3 %, (bundle). These values illustrate the potential of this approach for the development of natural‐based LSCs meeting the requirements of reliable, sustainable, and competitive energy systems.",

However, the presence of challenges makes SETs implementation difficult, and hence to increase the effective adoption of SETs, potential strategies are essential to overcome challenges. The objective of this study is to identify and rank major strategies of SETs adoption in the construction sector to overcome its barriers. This study proposes an integrated framework based on two methodologies, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to an ideal solution (F‐TOPSIS), to prioritize major strategies to overcome SETs adoption barriers. Initially, obstacles and strategies are identified from a comprehensive literature review. Later, FAHP is utilized to obtain weights of various SETs barriers through pairwise comparison, and strategies are ranked by using F‐TOPSIS. The proposed methodology is empirically applied to the construction sector of developing countries. The integrated framework provides a detailed and effective decision‐making tool for uptake and adoption of SETs. Lastly, the robustness of the methodology is evaluated with the support of sensitivity analysis. Results indicate that government and economic barriers are the most critical barriers which can be overcome through cooperation of relevant authorities, financial assistance, and developing appropriate policies.",

However, foams have, so far, been restricted to nanoparticles grafting onto inert foam substrates, with the consequent risk of nanoparticle release into the environment. In this work, self‐supporting, highly porous photocatalytic zinc oxide (ZnO) foams are produced using a combination of liquid templating and sintering for the first time. Systematic changes in sintering times and temperature affect the foams’ morphology and structure, in turn controlling their photocatalytic activity and stability. Sintering at 900 °C and decreasing sintering times from 20 to 6 h lead to a doubling in surface‐area‐to‐volume ratio and a 30% increase in pore diameter, resulting in a near doubling of the overall quantum yield and degradation kinetics. However, photocorrosion and Zn leaching increase markedly for the shortest sintering time. Optimal sintering conditions at 900 °C for 12 h yield foams capable of effectively degrading the model micropollutant carbamazepine under UV irradiation with high stability, showing no performance decrease over five irradiation cycles corresponding to 20 h of use. This study paves the way to producing self‐supporting, highly stable photocatalytic foams for the removal of organic micropollutants in water treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Interfacial solar steam generation is an emerging strategy to improve the global freshwater supply. Herein, for the first time, a plausible alternative based on bone waste is presented for low‐cost solar steam generation and seawater desalination. This is accomplished via the exploration of the appropriate carbonization conditions for the successful bone transformation into a porous carbon‐based photothermal material. The carbonized bone (CB) not only is composed of inherent interlinked mesoporous microchannels for efficient water transportation but also displays broadband light absorption, photothermal conversion, and reduced vaporization enthalpy due to its special interactions with water. The as‐prepared CB shows an apparent evaporation rate of 1.82 kg m −2 h −1 under one‐sun illumination, attributed not only to its interaction with the sunlight but also to its performance in the dark field, and a solar‐to‐vapor conversion efficiency of 80%. Furthermore, CB desalinates water with an efficiency of 99.99%. Such performance combined with its wide availability, facile fabrication, and stability makes this biowaste‐based porous material a promising system for the production of freshwater. In this way, a valuable alternative for the valorization of bone‐based food‐waste is offered, paving the way to new routes for the management of such, continuously growing, food‐waste products.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The conservation of ocean and freshwater have been crucial issues over the past decades, and oil/water separation is a well‐known technology to restore polluted water systems. In the meantime, oil sorbents serve as a promising means of achieving water conservation to recover from oil spills, which require a multi‐factorial approach to review high selectivity, capacity, and rate of oil recovery. However, reusability is a critical component to consider in incidents with large‐scale spills. With the development of sorbent technology, some studies have progressed to explore surface engineering and material design for high oil sorption capacity and durability. Thus, this systemic review, a summary of sorbent developments, serves as a guide to understanding practical applications that can apply to large‐scale oil spills and recognize remaining issues. In this review, the oil weathering process and oil sorption mechanisms in relation to the characteristics of target pollutants are introduced. Then, this comprehensive review focuses on materials in advanced sorbents. These materials have properties including, aligned channels for fast sorption, self‐heating capabilities for viscous oil cleanup, and magnetic‐responsiveness to enhance a collection of final products. The perspective and challenges for the next generation of oil spills remediation technology‐based oil sorbents materials are finally presented in the last section.",

The combination of these materials produces elastic circuit boards that act as soft platforms for body‐mounted sensors or biodegradable stretchable light‐emitting devices. These soft platforms reveal linear elongations at a break of 130% to 350% and similar moduli to nondegradable elastomers and human tissue, without any decrease in conductivity.

In this work, a simple yet effective solvent engineering strategy is developed to enable aromatic alcohols/aldehydes to be efficiently oxidized to carboxylic acids by a laccase‐TEMPO system. Citrate buffer (100–300 m m , pH 6) rather than the widely used acetate buffer (pH 4–5) proves to be optimal for this purpose. The roles of citrate are discussed in laccase‐TEMPO‐catalyzed synthesis of carboxylic acids. 5‐Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) of 200 m m is oxidized to 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a top‐value biobased chemical in the polymer industry, in 28 h with a yield of up to 97%.

Gram‐scale preparation of FDCA and 5‐methyl‐2‐pyrazinecarboxylic acid, an important drug intermediate, is demonstrated with total turnover numbers up to 110 000 for laccase and space‐time yields up to 1.0 g/(L•h).

    "abstract": "Abstract Lignin is the largest renewable source of aromatics with an annual production of ≈50 to 70 million tons worldwide. Unfortunately, despite being a rich source of aromatic chemicals, almost 98% to 99% of lignin is burned as a low‐value fuel and only 1% to 2% is utilized as high‐value chemicals. It is noteworthy that lignin is cross‐linked with carbohydrate fractions of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) through a stable lignin‐carbohydrate covalent complex, making it the main hurdle in converting LCB. Moreover, the stability of the inter‐unit linkages (COC, CC) and the strong interactions among the aromatic units, makes the separation into aromatic monomers challenging. Hence, a delignification pathway through a sustainable approach represents a formidable challenge for the development of future biorefineries. A breakthrough in several technological pathways, e.g., LCB fractionation, lignin characterization/depolymerization, and economic analysis are being considered. However, there remains a dearth of in‐depth understanding and a thorough know‐how. This review navigates readers through the latest cutting‐edge innovations in these four interconnected biorefinery aspects, and may inspire others to propagate the growth of biorefineries in the upcoming years. Overall, the objective of this review is to provide insights into lignin valorization technologies which may guide the future research toward sustainable biorefineries.",

Herein, 3D reduced graphene oxide (RGO) decorated cellulose acetate filter (RGF) evaporators are fabricated by immersing the porous cellulose acetate filters (CFs) in a suspension of graphene oxide, followed by drying and chemical reduction for efficient solar steam generation. The RGO sheets can absorb solar light and convert solar energy to thermal energy, while the hydrophilic and porous CFs with lots of vertical channels are responsible for transporting water to the top evaporation surfaces and accommodating the RGO sheets. In addition to gaining thermal energy from direct solar energy absorption and conversion, the sidewall of the RGF evaporator can also gain additional thermal energy from the surrounding environment as long as the sidewall temperature of the RGF evaporator is lower than the surrounding environment temperature as a result of the cooling effect of the evaporation. Driven by both solar energy and environmental energy, the RGF evaporator achieves a high water generation rate of ≈ 2.81 kg m −2 h −1 with an energy conversion efficiency of ≈ 130.2%, and high efficiencies in cleaning seawater and wastewater are also demonstrated.",

In recent years, interfacial solar evaporators have attracted much attention due to their higher energy efficiency compared to traditional technologies that directly heat bulk water. However, its development has been hampered by the complex preparation process, high costs, and low evaporation performance. Here, a bilayer biomass solar interfacial evaporator—polypyrrole‐sorghum straw (PPy‐SS) evaporator—by coating PPy on the cross section of natural SS is developed via a facile in situ polymerization method at room temperature. The upper PPy layer can achieve a light absorption of about 96% in the range of 200–2500 nm and convert light energy into heat to evaporate water; the lower SS layer can provide continuous water supply to the PPy layer and localize the heat onto the PPy layer. The PPy‐SS evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 1.385 kg m −2 h −1 and a high evaporation efficiency of 81.9% under 1 Sun illumination. Furthermore, PPy‐SS evaporator displays excellent performance in desalination of seawater. Therefore, such PPy‐SS solar evaporator has great potential for application in solar desalination to alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources.",

However, the strong adsorption between O 2 molecules and Pd atoms is not conducive to the formation of intermediate HOO * and leads to the further reduction of H 2 O 2 to H 2 O, thus limiting the improvement of H 2 O 2 production. To solve the issue, in this work, Cu–Pd alloy cocatalysts are selectively modified on the electron‐rich facets of BiVO 4 via facile photoinduced deposition and subsequent galvanic displacement. DFT calculations indicate that the incorporation of Cu atoms to Pd atoms weakens the oxygen adsorption energy and HOO * binding energy on Pd atom surfaces, thus increasing the activity and selectivity of O 2 reduction to H 2 O 2 . Further experimental results show that the optimized Cu‐Pd/BiVO 4 (5:1) photocatalyst exhibits markedly boosted activity for H 2 O 2 production (2189 µ mol L ‐1 ), which is 3.2‐fold higher than that of BiVO 4 with modification of 0.3 wt% Pd cocatalyst (675 µ mol L ‐1 ). Additionally, the incorporation of metal Cu enables the economic utilization of Pd atoms and reduces the expense of the Pd cocatalyst.",

Herein, a robust and flexible 3D hydrogel/fiber evaporator mounted with solid–solid phase change materials (SPCMs) for efficient photothermal desalination is reported. The hydrogel fills the spaces of fibers and not only forms a topology‐like structure to strengthen the sunlight absorption (≈0.1% optical transmittance and ≈10% reflectance), but also reinforces the mechanical strength and elasticity of the evaporator (≈4 MPa tensile strength and ≈23 MPa Young's modulus). Notably, highly thermally‐conductive SPCMs fulfill a dual function under light‐dark conditions, facilitating a 3D evaporator for absorbing energy from high‐temperature environment under daylight, and releasing latent heat to sustain evaporation when light is turned off, ultimately achieving evaporation rates of 3.80 and 0.31 kg m –2 h –1 under different conditions. Such a durable 3D hydrogel/fiber evaporator with dramatic evaporation performance opens up promising prospects for freshwater production in remote areas.",

Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) have gained increasing popularity despite rising prices and uncertainty around sourcing the component materials. This has recently prompted the development of alternative alkali batteries, such as sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). However, despite academic efforts focused on optimizing technical performance, few have studied the underlying economic and environmental impacts of alkali batteries. Therefore, this research examines the techno‐economic and environmental performance of SIBs, using a “cradle‐to‐gate” life cycle assessment of cell manufacturing, comparing sodium‐ion half cells (coin cells) with their lithium counterparts. An optimal charge capacity of 312.4 mAh g −1 for sodium‐ion half‐cells has been achieved using glucose‐derived hard‐carbons, a 45% charge capacity increase compared to lithium. Sodium half‐cells are shown to be 18% cheaper compared to lithium. From the life cycle analysis, it is found that sodium‐ion half‐cells show the lowest environmental footprint across all impact categories compared to lithium. It can be concluded that sodium is a credible alternative to LIBs with a preference for SIBs when environmental factors are jointly considered with techno‐economics.",

The main focus of this study is to compare four existing estimation models in Jaén, Spain, and to analyze their performance in an environment different than that where each of them is developed. The results indicate that all models can reproduce accurately the seasonality of soiling in Jaén, if a cleaning threshold of 0.3 mm day −1 is considered. The models’ performance is found to be influenced not only by the mass concentration but also by the optical properties of each component of the atmospheric particulate matter, with an overestimation up to 4% in high organic carbon concentration periods. The natural cleaning role of rainfalls and its influence on the modeling error are also discussed through the paper.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lignin is an abundant biopolymer deriving from industrial pulping processes of lignocellulosic biomass. Despite the huge amount of yearly produced lignin waste, it finds scarce application as a fine material and is usually destined to be combusted in thermochemical plants to feed, with low efficiency, other industrial processes. So far, the use of lignin in materials science is limited by the scarce knowledge of its molecular structure and properties, depending also on its isolation method. However, lignin represents an intriguing feedstock of organic material. Here, the structural and chemical‐physical characteristics of two kraft lignins, L1 and L2 , are analyzed. First, several molecular characterization techniques, such as attenuated total reflectance ‐ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analyses, gel permeation chromatography, evolved gas analysis‐mass spectrometry, UV–vis, 31 P‐ and 13 C‐ nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies are applied to get insights into their different structures and their degree of molecular degradation. Then, their efficient application as gate dielectric materials is demonstrated for organic field‐effect transistors, finding the increased capacity of L1 with respect to L2 in triggering functional and efficient devices with both p‐type and n‐type organic semiconductor molecules.",

Such challenges can be addressed by collecting and recycling spent LIBs through economically and environmentally sustainable processes and by enabling the transition to a circular economy vision based on the use of secondary raw materials. These processes involve not only the metallurgic approaches to recover the critical metals, but also the pretreatment approaches that are crucial to enhance the recovery efficiency of other valuable materials (e.g., graphite, fluorinated compounds, binders, electrolyte). Herein, pretreatment processes ranging from the disassembling, opening, and sorting to the component separation, collection, and recovery, are described for the EoL 18650‐type commercial LIB. A closed loop of eco‐friendly recycling to fully recover the composite cathode, i.e., the cathode active material (CAM), the fluorinated binder, and the conductive carbon, as well as the separator, is presented. The recovery approach is based on green solvents and is designed to limit water consumption. The recovered materials are used to assemble a new cell, and the electrochemical characterization is used to evaluate the effective feasibility of the whole recycling process.",

In contrast, the formation/stabilization of cationic Cu species in copper oxides, or doping Cu with another element, like Ni, is not possible. It is found that the pure and mixed Cu:Zn electrodes behave similarly in term of electrocatalytic selectivity to multi‐carbon products. At higher Zn concentrations the electrode behaves like the pure Zn catalyst, which indicates that the Cu cationic species do not have a significant influence on the selectivity to multi‐carbon products. It is found that in the non‐monotonically distribution of products is dominated in term of surface energy in which copper prefers the surface.

    "abstract": "Abstract Sensors and transducers enable the robots’ movements and interactions with humans and the environment. Particularly, tactile and motion sensors, even those inspired by the human skin, often miss many of its essential features. Indeed, the materials that constitute such sensors are often rigid and lack self‐healing and biodegradability. Furthermore, the large‐scale diffusion of these technologies propelled by robots spread in many aspects of the lives, from industrial to household settings, contributes heavily to the electronic and robotic waste problem. Recycling strategies for materials for robotics sensors are thus pivotal for future development. This work proposes self‐healable, recyclable, and biodegradable electrically conductive coatings. These coatings are based on conductive inks that combine graphene nanoplatelets and carbon nanofibers with a soft biodegradable vitrimer binder and are realized by spray coating. The use of the vitrimer ensures satisfying adhesion to diverse substrates, flexibility, conformability, self‐healing, and recyclability of the conductive coating. This material is a sustainable alternative to standard conductive inks for flexible electronics and soft robotics. Indeed, tests for the live monitoring of SoftHand3, the grasping system of many worldwide diffused robots, have yielded promising results. The use of biodegradable ingredients and the possibility of recycling makes it an appealing material to face the sustainability issue of today's electronics and robotics.",

The deposition of material occurs at 673 K using an aqueous solution of NH 4 VO 3 , with a constant solution spray rate of 10 mL min −1 and airflow rate of 10 L min −1 . Structural analysis confirms the pure orthorhombic structure formation of the V 2 O 5 material, while FE‐SEM images show a well‐organized 3D spongy‐like porous architecture. The excellent conformality of the ASPD enables the deposition of high‐aspect‐ratio 3D structured nanoporous V 2 O 5 electrodes for next‐generation supercapacitor applications. The hierarchical structured 3D nanoporous V 2 O 5 electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance in a 1 M Na 2 SO 3 electrolyte. Within the potential window 0 to ‐1.3 V, the electrode archives the highest specific capacitance (SC) of 453.32 F g −1 and also retains 86% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles. These properties mainly originate from the crystallinity, 3D nanoporous structure, and fast and easy ionic intercalation through the material. Furthermore, a symmetric supercapacitor device using this electrode is fabricated and which yields outstanding electrochemical performance. Overall, the results highlight the potential of 3D nanoporous V 2 O 5 as an outstanding electrode material for next‐generation supercapacitor applications.",

Since the 1950s, the mass production of plastics has seriously threatened global sustainability, lacking effective post‐use management. E‐waste worsens the issue due to low recyclability and high toxicity. Resolving this requires improving biodegradability. The paper explores eco‐friendly biodegradable materials for a zero‐e‐waste society, focusing on multifunctional plastics in electronics, providing a comprehensive guide to material selection, and illustrating novel concepts through recent trials. The goal is fully biodegradable electronics, but transitioning from conventional material systems is complex. Notably, rendering engineering plastics in electronics biodegradable surpasses simply substituting conventional plastics. Thus, it is delved into various research initiatives focused on biodegradable materials for electronics, highlighting a systematic approach toward creating a fully integrated, biodegradable electronic system. This includes exploring the mechanisms of biodegradation and the integration of printed circuit boards (PCBs), a critical component in electronics. Achieving this represents a challenging but promising step toward a sustainable electronic future.",

The results show that B‐atoms have been successfully incorporated into the g‐C 3 N 4 network. The as‐synthesized BCN‐ x ( x shows the weight content of MCNPBA) photocatalysts are evaluated in photocatalytic hydrogen (H 2 ) evolution from water splitting under visible‐light (λ ≥ 420 nm). The optimized BCN‐10 sample shows a maximum H 2 evolution rate of 1789.93 µmol h ─1 g ─1 , which is 6.2 times higher than that of g‐C 3 N 4 (289.73 µmol h ─1 g ─1 ). This is attributed to the fact that the electron‐deficient B‐atoms are lewis acids that trap electrons, which in turn expands visible‐light absorption, narrows the bandgap, and prevents the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, B‐doping can readily modify the valence and conduction band positions of g‐C 3 N 4 , therefore augmenting the photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity. This paper presents a unique rational framework for developing other functionalized electron‐deficient elemental‐doping g‐C 3 N 4 ‐based photocatalysts for practical applications in solar‐to‐fuel conversion.",

Models for vibration frequency sensing based on F‐TENG and energy capture based on MTEG are established. A flexible self‐powered sensing prototype, integrating F‐TENG, MTEG, and a Signal processing and Energy harvesting Circuit (SEC), is fabricated. Additionally, an innovative solvothermal method for the preparation of MTEG materials is presented, resulting in Bi2Te3‐based thermoelectric materials with significantly high thermoelectric conversion performance. Experimental results demonstrate that within the range of 0.1–5.1 Hz, F‐TENG can precisely perceive the frequency of GTLs, with a maximum error of 1.274%. MTEG achieves a maximal open‐circuit voltage of 3.282 V. Finally, the SEC unit is designed to couple the outputs of F‐TENG and MTEG for frequency calculation and wireless transmission to a microcontroller.

A mechanistic investigation combining electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), and time‐dependent density‐functional theory (TD‐DFT) calculations reveals a photoinduced hydrogen atom abstraction involving the triplet excited state 3* AQDS and the glycerol substrate ( k = 1.02(±0.03)×10 7 m −1 ·s −1 , H/D kinetic isotope effect = 2.00±0.16). The resulting ketyl radical of AQDS follows fast deprotonation to the radical anion AQDS •– , that further reacts with oxygen ( k = 1.2×10 8 m −1 ·s −1 ), ultimately leading to the production of H 2 O 2 .",

The development of high‐performance photocatalysts is crucial for significantly improving the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) involved. Polyoxometalate (POM)‐derived materials, known for their tunable compositions, diverse structures, electron storage/release capabilities, as well as quasi‐semiconductor photochemical properties, serve as highly efficient catalysts in sustainable photosynthesis. This comprehensive review navigates the latest advancements in the assembly strategies and HER performance of POM‐based crystalline materials. It also discusses the composite materials formed by infiltrating POM into metal‐organic frameworks (MOF) and examines the roles of transition metal compounds derived from polyoxometalates, such as sulfides and carbides, in photocatalytic HER. Emphasis is placed on the prospects for the future development of POM‐based compounds as photocatalysts, along with several strategies and outlooks that could facilitate their progress. POM‐derived materials are believed to have significant potential to enhance hydrogen production efficiency while maintaining thermal stability in HER processes.",

Although the catalytic activity of individual ZIFs is relatively low, their pore structure and size distribution can be rationally designed and optimized through appropriate chemical modifications and post‐treatment strategies to enhance their catalytic performance. This process requires meticulous control of ZIFs materials to meet the specific demands of catalytic reactions. In this study, a series of CoSe/NiSe 2 nanosheets is synthesized with precisely engineered morphology and architecture using a precursor route involving ZIFs. Notably, the CoSe/NiSe 2 ‐3 nanosheets exhibit a remarkable overpotential of 250.5 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline seawater and 215.3 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Furthermore, when used as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the material also shows excellent electrocatalytic activity. When integrated with the a forementioned electrocatalyst into a full cell configuration, the device operates at a low voltage of 1.956 V at a current density of 100 mA cm −2 in an alkaline seawater medium, while maintaining excellent stability over a 12‐h operational period.",

This paper systematically looks at the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the Poyang Lake Region (PLR) in China to examine the spatial processes for insights into cities and urbanization, balancing the environmental and socio‐economic dimensions. A total of 226 805 cells are analyzed to unveil the relationship between sustainability changes in 2015–2019 period and urban form indicators, considering sociodemographic variables, geographical features, and city size as control variables. Two tree‐based machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) are developed. This study provides evidence that a monocentric urban form and a high share of small activity clusters are not good for sustainability. For each urban form indicator, there is a non‐linear relationship with sustainability. The results of the machine learning models reconfirm the sustainability benefits of having a strong second activity cluster comparable to the largest one. When planning cities, some forms of land use buffering are desirable. There is also support for developing relatively large activity nodes and promoting compactness in urban form. Beyond urban form characteristics, the levels of urbanization, economic development, and population are still highly relevant.",

The modification of ZnO nanorods by the N‐SiO 2 dots is corroborated by changes in the flat band potential, revealed from Mott‐Schottky measurements. The EPR and photoluminescence studies confirm p ‐type ZnO attributable to zinc vacancies (V Zn ). The batch [ZnO/N‐SiO 2 ] 363 exhibits maximum photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin in water.

Based in such socio‐scientific‐economic scenario, and in the pursuit of sustainable and environmentally conscious technologies, this work presents a novel approach to the development of a multifunctional electroluminescent (EL) device capable of both efficient lighting and electric field frequency sensing applications. The proposed device integrates a composite based on zinc sulfide co‐doped with copper (ZnS:Cu) phosphor particles and plant‐based UV resin, to achieve enhanced functional properties and reduced environmental impact. The developed anycubic plant‐based UV resin clear (ECOr)/ZnS:Cu inks display viscosity values between 0.5 and 100 Pa.s (ensuring good quality of screen‐prints), and after printing composites exhibit thermal stability up to ≈200 °C; morphological homogeneity, dielectric properties dependent on the ZnS:Cu content (dielectric constant of 12.8 for the sample with 80 wt.% of filler); 30 cd.m 2 luminance for the sample with 80 wt.% of ZnS:Cu; and colorimetric electric field frequency sensing capability in the 0–3 kHz range.

In comparison to the pristine UiO‐66 and ZIF‐8, the core–shell MOF exhibits superior performance in terms of specific capacitance.

    "abstract": "Abstract Over the past few decades, the demand for lithium resources has increased significantly with the rapid development and extensive application of lithium‐ion batteries. Extracting lithium from salt‐lake brine is of significance because of its abundance in brines. Common methods for directly extracting lithium from salt lakes include precipitation, electrodialysis, and photothermal evaporation. Among these methods, lithium extraction using photothermal evaporation is considered an efficient and clean approach to addressing lithium shortages. In recent years, a lot of progress is made regarding lithium extraction with photothermal evaporation, so it is urgent to review the mechanistic basis and application of lithium extraction with photothermal evaporation. In this review, first, the mechanism of lithium extraction with photothermal evaporation is fully summarized, involving membrane separation, lithium‐ion sieves, and separated crystallization. Second, a series of strategies for designing various evaporators with highly efficient lithium adsorption characteristics based on photothermal materials are further discussed in detail. Finally, recommendations and perspectives on the larger‐scale development of lithium adsorbents by photothermal evaporation are proposed. Overall, this review not only offers in‐depth insight into lithium extraction from brines with low Li + concentration, but also inspires the development and design of next‐generation lithium extraction evaporators with unprecedented properties.",

Asymmetric wettability fabric‐based fog collection materials inspired by the Namib desert beetle have been reported widely due to their easy access and adjustable structures. Nevertheless, the single drive force for water transportation produced by the asymmetric wettability is insufficient, causing a non‐ideal fog harvesting efficiency. Moreover, sustainability challenges persist for fog collection materials, primarily due to their heavy dependence on chemical treatments. Herein, a diatom‐inspired Janus fabric (Ly/Csp‐3) based on asymmetric wettability and aperture gradient is developed without additional physical or chemical treatment. The wettability gradient and aperture gradient generate dual directional drive forces that regulate the water transport direction more accurately and enhance the transportation rate more effectively. Ly/Csp‐3 reaches a one‐way transport index of 390.7% and a water collecting rate (WCR) of 1170.5 mg cm −2 h −1 , while exhibiting the capability of anti‐acid rain and the resistance to sunlight.

However, the understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms is still at its beginning. In this paper, an in‐depth investigation of tetra‐lithium perylene‐3,4,9,10‐tetracarboxylate as a lithium‐ion anode model compound is presented, which can be easily synthesized from commercially available 3,4,9,10‐perylene‐tetracarboxylic‐dianhydride. The results reveal that the lithium uptake is limited to two lithium ions per molecule along a two‐phase equilibrium potential within an operational voltage range down to 0.1 V. Below the corresponding potential plateau at 1.1 V the origin of the extra capacity is solely related to the presence of large amounts of conductive carbon. Based on these findings, optimized electrode composites with increased active material ratios of up to 95 wt% and a total active material mass loading of about 12.0 mg cm −2 , that is, remarkably augmented areal capacities (≈1.2 mAh cm −2 ), using percolating carbon nanotubes as electron conductor and environment‐friendly, fluorine‐free aqueous binders, are developed. In addition to the more than tenfold increase in areal capacity, these optimized electrode compositions show enhanced first cycle coulombic efficiencies, thus providing a great leap forward toward their commercial exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is widely recognized that the oxygenated carbonaceous materials improve the performance of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). However, whether the enhanced vanadium redox reactions are due to the existence of grafted oxygen‐containing functional groups (OCFGs) or the enlarged specific surface areas (SSAs) during the course of surface treatments is still under dispute. To determine which factor is indeed responsible for the enhanced redox reactions, a set amount of OCFGs is intentionally grafted on the model carbon electrode without modifying the surface area using an alkaline‐mediated hydrothermal treatment. Experimental results, using the peak potential separation and the activation energy as electroactivity descriptors in the three‐electrode cell, demonstrate that OCFGs promote the V(II)/V(III) redox reaction, while exhibiting a minute catalytic effect on the V(IV)/V(V) redox reaction. The superior electroactivity is also testified by a flow battery test, in which the energy efficiency as well as the charge/discharge capacity of VRFBs with hydrothermally treated samples is significantly higher than those of VRFBs with the pristine one. Through these experiments, it is verified that OCFGs contribute to the electroactivity promotion for carbon electrodes rather than the enhanced SSA. The findings can guide the effort to design high‐performing carbonaceous electrodes for VRFBs.",

The failure of electrode materials, which leads to early capacity decay and safety issues in existing Li‐ion batteries, however, is still a technical challenge and deserves further investigation. In this review, recent advances in how in situ characterization techniques can be adopted to understand material failure mechanisms in Li‐ion battery are highlighted with a focus on failure and degradation of negative electrode materials. The information presented in this article is believed to be beneficial to application of advanced in situ characterization techniques in the development of next‐generation battery systems with improved electrochemical properties and structural integrity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing public awareness of the energy crisis since the 1970s has promoted the ongoing development of energy conversion and storage systems. As a supplement to photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) are among the promising solar electricity generation systems. However, the intrinsic intermittence of sunlight can never guarantee continuous electricity supply. Therefore, PECs are being developed to convert solar energy to chemical energy in the forms of fuels such as H 2 and other organic chemicals. However, this technology requires massive storage systems for the solar fuels/chemicals, and complementary conversion systems for electricity generation from the solar fuels. Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are capable of large‐scale real‐time electricity storage and conversion. Both PECs and RFBs have been investigated for more than three decades, yet the integration of these two systems has not reached maturity. Hence, this review aims to give a critical overview of the state‐of‐the‐art progress in solar redox flow batteries, from the aspects of the working mechanism, device engineering, and performance evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Selective laser sintering (SLS) 3D printing is used to fabricate highly macroporous ion scavenger filters for recovery of Pd and Pt from electronic waste. The scavengers are printed by using a mixture of polypropylene with 10 wt% of type‐1 anion exchange resin. Porosities and the flow‐through properties of the filters are controlled by adjusting the SLS printing parameters. The cylinder‐shaped filters are used in selective recovery of Pd and Pt from acidic leachate of electronic waste simply by passing the solution through the object. Under such conditions, the scavenger filters are able to capture Pd and Pt as anionic complexes with high efficiency from a solution containing mixture of different metal ions. By using the Pd/Pt scavenger together with previously reported, highly selective nylon‐based Au scavenger, precious metals, i.e., Au, Pd, and Pt could all be recovered from the electronic waste leachate in a single flow‐through process. One of the main advantages of the printed scavengers is that all recovered metals can be easily extracted from the filters as separate fractions by using aqueous solutions of thiourea or diluted nitric acid. After removal of the captured metals, the scavengers are reusable without significant loss of their ion‐capturing performance.",

To introduce intumescent properties, phosphoryl chloride and 3‐amino‐1,2,4‐triazole are introduced into kraft lignin prior to it being resinified with the α,ω‐alkanediols. In simple combustion tests using a gas burner at 1300 °C, the resins prepared exhibit nonburnable properties, producing only a swollen char. According to dynamic mechanical analysis, the glass transition temperature decreases with an increase in the carbon number and amount of the alkanediols introduced. The mechanical loss tangent (tan δ) value of the prepared resins is below 1, indicating that the resins would not drip flaming particles during burning. Indeed, the specimens do not generate particles in the simple combustion tests. According to the results of cone calorimeter testing, the total heat release and the peak heat release rate are significantly smaller than those of a commercial phenol‐formaldehyde‐resin‐containing flame retardant.",

Here, a plasmonic structure realized on a monocrystallized Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) nanosheet‐assembled membrane is presented. This unique CZTS structure exhibits high absorption efficiency (≈92.25%) in a broad solar spectrum (200–2500 nm), leading to a solar desalination efficiency of ≈84.5% under 1 Sun irradiation. This highly efficient broadband absorption is due to the structure induced localized surface plasmon resonance absorption. Besides, owing to its high chemical stability, salty water containing heavy metal ions can be effectively desalinated with a constant long time (&gt;20 h) durability using this CZTS membranes as the absorber. The combination of the robust desalination effect, high stability and durability, as well as the low‐cost and scalable process for production, makes this type of CZTS membranes one of the most competitive desalination candidates.",

The synthesis, done in an aqueous solution at room temperature, takes just 2 min compared to hours or days in nonaqueous conditions. The structural integrity and phase purity of ZIF‐8 are studied through X‐ray powder diffraction and are of sodalite topology, and its surface nature and composition are determined with X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy. ZIF‐8 has high crystallinity, large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (1398.7 m 2 g −1 ) and pore volume (0.62 cm 3 g −1 ). Images of ZIF‐8 show hexagonal nanocrystals, whose growth is observed with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Thermogravimetric analysis data testify the thermal stability of the material (490 °C in air). Zeta potential measurement confirms that trinitrotoluene (TNT) molecules adsorb onto ZIF‐8. The interaction between the electron‐deficient aromatic core of TNT and the electron‐rich ZIF‐8 is considered to favor the formation of donor–acceptor electron‐transfer mechanism, and the electron conductivity of ZIF‐8 facilitates the effective reduction of TNT. Using the prepared ZIF‐8, an electrochemical sensor is fabricated to detect TNT and other nitroaromatic explosives in aqueous phase. The sensor performance is highly linear, with very low limit of detection (346 × 10 −12 m ), and is unaffected by the presence of various interferents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In today's fast‐paced and well‐connected world, consumer electronics are evolving rapidly. As a result, the amount of discarded electronic devices is becoming a major health and environmental concern. The rapid expansion of flexible electronics has the potential to transform consumer electronic devices from rigid phones and tablets to robust wearable devices. This means increased use of plastics in consumer electronics and the potential to generate more persistent plastic waste for the environment. Hence, today, the need for flexible biodegradable electronics is at the forefront of minimizing the mounting pile of global electronic waste. A “bioadvantaged” approach to develop a biodegradable, flexible, and application‐adaptable electronic components based on crop components and graphene is reported. More specifically, by combining zein, a corn‐derived protein, and aleuritic acid, a major monomer of tomato cuticles and sheellac, along with graphene, biocomposite conductors having low electrical resistance (≈10 Ω sq −1 ) with exceptional mechanical and fatigue resilience are fabricated. Further, a number of high‐performance electronic applications, such as THz electromagnetic shielding, flexible GHz antenna construction, and flexible solar cell electrode, are demonstrated. Excellent performance results are measured from each application comparable to conventional nondegrading counterparts, thus paving the way for the concept of “plant‐ e ‐tronics” towards sustainability.",

Herein, a purely transition metal‐based, Ni‐promoted 3D draped porous Co 3 O 4 (Ni/3DDP‐Co 3 O 4 ) catalyst is demonstrated to be highly effective for CO 2 methanation, achieving 100% CO 2 conversion and CH 4 selectivity at 250 °C and a space velocity of 48 000 mL (g h) −1 .

An abundance of surface oxygen vacancies extrinsically forms on the Ni/3DDP‐Co 3 O 4 by both Co–Ni charge‐compensating mechanisms and hydrogen treatment, in conjunction with the low‐temperature reducibility, high surface area, and strong Co–Ni interaction effect, enabling the enhanced catalytic performance for CO 2 methanation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the major problems related to the use of dyes in industrial applications is their elimination from the water or soil and eventually their recovery and reutilization. In this context, a new biocompatible material, previously considered suitable for biomedical applications, is presented for the first time, as an innovative adsorbent material for wastewater treatment. A polyamidoamine‐based hydrogel, prepared by Michael‐type polyaddition in water, is used for efficiently adsorbing two anionic toxic textile dyes from aqueous solutions. Several parameters affecting the adsorption process, such as the pH of solutions containing dyes, the amount of hydrogel and dyes, and the effect of temperature, are investigated. Moreover, the hydrogel dehydration and swollen conditions by using dye water solution are studied by Thermo‐Gravimetry (TG) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses, finding that the dehydration temperature plays a relevant role in determining the subsequent adsorbing behavior. The material characterization shows that the adsorption process can be attributed to a combination of electrostatic attraction and intermolecular interactions between hydrogel functional groups and the dye molecules. Visible absorption spectroscopy and Fourier Transform InfraRed‐Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR‐ATR) support the findings. The kinetics of the dye adsorption process are also evaluated, together with the adsorption isotherms.",

Light‐absorbing semiconductors as well as electrodes modified with sensitizers typically catalyze oxygen photoreduction to hydrogen peroxide. Here, it is reported that, in contrast to these heterogeneous systems, a homogeneous solution of a metal‐free organic dye can perform the whole catalytic cycle of hydrogen peroxide photoevolution itself. This cycle can proceed with simultaneous oxidation of various organic molecules as electron donors, or even water. In the three water‐soluble dyes that are experimented with, photoevolution of peroxide occurs favorably at neutral to basic pH. The reaction is first order with respect to dye concentration, and evidence implicates a single‐electron reduction pathway with superoxide as an intermediate. Photostability of the dyes over time correlates with increased oxidation potential of the molecule. The finding that hydrogen peroxide can be produced in aqueous solution with single fully organic molecules performing the entire photocatalytic cycle creates a new avenue for the peroxide carbon free energy cycle.",

Unlike their commercialized lithium‐ion analogues, sodium‐ion capacitors use sodium ions in the cell operation. A classic configuration of a sodium‐ion capacitor includes a battery‐type anode with a capacitive cathode within the same cell, thus optimizing both the energy and power densities of the device. This is commonly achieved by using hard carbon anodes and activated carbon cathodes, although other suitable anode materials can be used. Meanwhile, the energy storage community has moved beyond this classic concept, with a number of cell configurations deviating from the classic sodium‐ion capacitor design having been described. These include the use of titanate and TiO 2 anodes with sloping charge profiles, the use of other nonstandard battery‐type anodes, an “upside‐down” sodium‐ion capacitor design, and the application of new materials (e.g., MXenes) as alternatives to the traditional capacitive electrodes.

Among the emerging candidates for post‐lithium‐ion batteries, aluminum‐based batteries are particularly promising due to the high theoretical capacities, low cost, and high abundance of raw materials. Most advanced nonaqueous rechargeable Al batteries rely on costly dialkylimidazolium chloride‐based chloroaluminate ionic liquids and this added cost inevitably diminishes various benefits of utilizing Al as the anode material. Here, a high‐performance Al battery made of Al anode, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) cathode, and a cost‐effective AlCl 3 ‐trimethylamine hydrochloride (AlCl 3 ‐TMAHCl) ionic liquid electrolyte is reported. The battery delivers a high specific capacity of 134 mAh g −1 at 2000 mA g −1 while maintaining Coulombic efficiency (CE) above 98% over 3000 cycles. Moreover, it delivers a specific capacity of 83 mAh g −1 with a CE of 97% under ultrafast charging at 4000 mA g −1 (1 min) and slow discharging at 100 mA g −1 (50 min) conditions.

Although many approaches including the introduction of new catalysts have successfully improved the performance of SWBs, reconsidering the cell design is an urgent requirement to improve the performance and scale up the production of practical batteries. In this study, by adjusting the maximum space efficiency, a rectangular cell is developed which due to its unique architecture, benefits from optimized contact to improve the overall charge transfer in the system. In view of the rigidity of the solid electrolyte, the novel cell model is intended to have adequate flexibility to be easily transported and practically utilized. Furthermore, the enhanced efficiency of the parallel stacked modules, indicates the capability of this cell in practical use. The designed catalyst‐free cell system shows a record capacity of 3.8 Ah (47.5 Ah kg −1 ), energy of 11 Wh (137.5 Wh kg −1 ), and peak power of 523 mW for individual unit cell, while it also retains performance up to 100 cycles.

The choline‐based amino acids synthesized in this study have good absorption capacities (up to 0.3 mol CO 2 /mol IL, with only 12.5 wt% IL in DMSO) that represent the best performance of CO 2 task‐specific IL solutions to date. These solutions are competitive due to their low cost, low environmental impact, easy processability (due to their low viscosity) and good regenerability for the production and storage of pure CO 2 .",

However, coke produced in the process deactivates the catalyst and the energy‐intensive regeneration procedures can produce considerable CO 2 emission. In this work, coke on the spent catalysts is analyzed by thermogravimetric‐mass spectra, Raman spectra, 1 H solid NMR spectra, and infrared spectra. Several C 3 species, including propyl, propylidene and propylidyne are found on the surface of the PtSn alloy. Several reaction pathways are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is also found that this coke can be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process. These results could provide theoretical guidance for optimizing process parameters in industry.",

Limiting factors for their development include the brittleness of lignin and the lack of large‐scale production routes. Here, a simple and economic wet‐spinning method, suitable for the fabrication of fibers based on softwood Kraft lignin (KL) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), is proposed. These two polymers reveal a partial miscibility in solution, and form metastable dispersions in solid state. KL‐PVA fibers are prepared at a weight ratio of 70:30 and are carbonized without thermo‐stabilization. A tailor‐made temperature program leads to a decreased microporosity on the fiber surfaces. The obtained carbon structures at 1000 °C are found to be poorly ordered, leading to only intermediate mechanical and electrical properties. However, graphitic domains appear at temperatures above 1500 °C and indicate a high potential for the system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The monomers and dimers produced via lignin depolymerization are a promising alternative to transportation fuels after hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). However, these compounds contain numerous oxygen‐containing functional groups that are strongly bonded to aromatic rings. Therefore, the conventional HDO of lignin‐derived compounds faces serious problems of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and low hydrocarbon yields. A metal–solid super acid catalyst, i.e., Ru(SO 4 2− )/ZrO 2 –CeO 2 , is synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for the HDO of various lignin‐derived monomers and dimers in a biphasic n ‐dodecane/H 2 O system. A high cyclohexane yield of 98.5% is obtained by the HDO of phenol performed at 200 °C and 5 MPa. The “hydrated” configuration can be formed between the hydrogenation intermediates and H 2 O on the Ru sites. In addition, the anionic vacancies of ZrO 2 –CeO 2 can be occupied by H − derived from the heterolytic cleavage of H 2 , leading to the formation of metal hydrides. The strong acidity of SO 4 2− /ZrO 2 –CeO 2 is beneficial for the subsequent deoxygenation of the hydrotreated products. In addition, the biphasic system can minimize the side reactions induced by the strong acidity of the catalyst. The catalytic system also exhibits a good catalytic performance for the HDO of other lignin‐derived monomers and dimers to produce cycloalkanes.",

To date, the ECDRR has been the most promising technology for the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to carbon‐building blocks, which has a huge market demand and increasing annual global production. Despite tremendous research, the conversion of CO 2 into valuable fuels and chemicals is still challenging due to the highly inert and diverse CO 2 reduction pathways towards high Faradaic efficiency, current density, and stability in the industrialization of ECDRR process. Herein, the most recent developments such as 1) the evaluation of the role of an electrocatalyst according to industrial production demands; 2) the performance of nanostructured electrocatalyst, electrolyte, and devices; 3) advantages and disadvantages of promising metals, such as Au, Ag, and Cu, and single‐atoms, such as Ni, Fe, and Co; and 4) the electrolyte effects, pH effects, and ion effects are described with a vision for ECDRR electrocatalysis towards industrialization. Finally, this review aims to offer forward‐looking, on‐going research/possible activities, together with future perspectives on the ECDRR process from a small‐scale production to industrialization.",

Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as novel hydrogen bond based solvents have attracted more and more attention. Research shows that the hydrogen bond between solvents and biomass is the main factor for their excellent performance in biomass fractionation. The cation or anion of ILs can form strong hydrogen bonding with biomass components during the pretreatment processes, which weakens the hydrogen bond interactions between biomass components, and further promotes the destruction of the biomass hydrogen bond network. Similar to ILs, with their designed hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, DESs can also form strong hydrogen bonds with biomass components for fractionation. Herein, this review outlines the recent development of biomass fractionation research through hydrogen‐bond interactions by using ILs and DESs with biomass. This work provides a framework for future investigation of biomass fractionation mechanisms, understanding the effect of ILs/DESs, and exploring more novel efficient biomass catalytic conversion systems.",

Although some evaporators with high evaporation rates and efficiencies have been reported, their inefficient performance under oblique illumination conditions remain to be overcome. Pinecones, with their delicate transpiration channels, photo‐thermal moisture‐sensitive deployable structure, and 3D Fibonacci helically‐arranged scales, inspire the design of this efficient evaporator under omnidirectional illumination. Herein, ultra‐black pinecone (UBP) with multi‐branched, arterially porous, and hierarchical structures shows excellent SSG performance under omnidirectional illumination. UBP achieves a high evaporation rate and efficiency of 1.86 kg m −2 h −1 and 97.85% respectively, under one sun illumination. The SSG performance under oblique incidence conditions of UBP are not degraded but improved (2.194 g h −1 under incident angle of 90°) because the UBP can recover reflection and radiation energy losses, avoid cosine energy losses, and absorb heat from the warm environment. The UBP also exhibits high evaporation rate in real weather and good durability and salt resistance in concentrated brine, which ensures its great potential applications in wastewater treatment and solar desalination.",

Supported catalysts are always used because proper support can effectively prevent metal particle agglomeration. In addition, the interaction between support and metal species can further enhance the catalytic activity. Herein, cobalt‐embedded porous carbon with polyhedral structure (CoPCP) is successfully synthesized by one‐step carbonization of a core‐shell structured ZIF‐8@ZIF‐67 composite. As support, Ru nanoparticles are loaded on CoPCP by in situ reduction to obtain Ru/CoPCP catalysts with a special hollow structure, effectively preventing Ru nanoparticles from agglomeration. Moreover, the existence of synergistic effect between Co metal and Ru nanoparticles in Ru/CoPCP catalyst is confirmed by a series of well‐designed control experiments. Both these factors endow the Ru/CoPCP catalyst with high activity and decent stability toward AB hydrolysis. A low activation energy ( E a = 31.25 kJ mol –1 ) and a high catalytic performance (turnover frequency = 243.4 mol H2 mol Ru –1 min –1 ) are simultaneously achieved for Ru 1 /CoPCP‐1000 even with a low amount of Ru (1.88 wt%).

However, despite the recent emerging of atomic resolution techniques, there is still a lack of understanding of the precise configuration of the M–N x single site. For example, metal porphyrins are known to act as catalysts for O 2 and they are indeed good model systems for mimicking M–N 4 sites. In particular, it would be of interest to gain more information on the precise dynamic of the catalytic process at atomic scale, especially in an electrochemical environment, i.e., at electrode/electrolyte interphase. An approach that is becoming more and more consolidated is to combine the information coming from electrochemistry and scanning tunneling microscopy techniques in electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (EC‐STM) and the result is that a precise dynamic of the catalytic site at atomic scale can be investigated. This review aims to emphasize the main results and advances of EC‐STM in investigating small molecule electrocatalysis and specifically O 2 reduction at metal porphyrins M–N 4 model system.",

Here, WO 3 nanofibers are modified by in situ growth of freestanding oxygen‐vacancy Ni(OH) 2‐ x nanosheets, and explored their charge separation and CO 2 reduction mechanisms by using in situ characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Some electrons of Ni(OH) 2‐ x transferred to WO 3 nanofibers upon hybridization owing to their remarkable different work function, which induces a built‐in electric field (BIEF) at interfaces with directions pointing from Ni(OH) 2‐ x to WO 3 . Driven by the electric field, the photogenerated electrons flow to Ni(OH) 2‐ x , while the holes remain at WO 3 , achieving spatial charge separation. Further, CO 2 adsorbed on Ni(OH) 2‐ x shows apparent molecular activation, as suggested by its bent and elongated OCO bonds. The Ni(OH) 2‐ x /WO 3 nanofibers exhibit an enhanced CO production rate with respect to WO 3 (54.4 vs 8.1 µmol g −1 h −1 ).

Resulting from Fermi level difference and electron transfer, an internal electric field is built at heterojunction interfaces and contributes to the formation of S‐scheme heterojunctions, as unveiled by in situ irradiation X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time‐resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. CO 2 molecules are chemisorbed and activated over the photocatalyst in views of DFT simulations. The CO 2 photoreduction follows a *COOH‐intermediate pathway and affords an enhanced CO production rate (12.6 µmol g −1 ) with nearly 100% selectivity in the absence of any molecular cocatalyst or scavenger. The enhanced performance is ascribed to the efficient charge separation, stronger redox ability, and powerful CO 2 activation of In 2 O 3 /ZnO S‐scheme heterojunctions.",

Nevertheless, it bears significant challenges related to excessive swelling of the wetted membranes and catalyst layers during coating. Thermal decaling, which is currently used in proton exchange electrolysis, cannot be used with typical hydrocarbon‐based anion‐exchange membranes due to the lack of a glass transition point. In this work, a novel direct‐coating approach for MEAs for anion‐exchange membrane water electrolysis is proposed. An additional adhesive foil is used to minimize membrane swelling during the coating of the second catalyst layer. The resulting cell efficiency (1 A cm −2 at 1.8 V with ≥ 1.9 mg Ir cm −2 ) is comparable to spray‐coated cells, while the mass transport is reduced at higher current densities (2.11 V vs 2.27 V at 2.7 A cm −2 ). A fully self‐casted catalyst‐coated membrane with low thickness (35 µm) achieves promising performance of 1.4 A cm −2 at 1.8 V in 0.1 m KOH and 2.0 A cm −2 in 1 m KOH. Constant current holds at 1 A cm −2 in 1 m KOH further shows a comparably low degradation rate of both spray‐ and bar‐coated cells (≈1 mV h −1 ) after a stabilization period.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Developing highly efficient, robust, and noble metal‐free photocatalytic systems is essential for the large‐scale implementation of solar‐to‐chemical energy conversion. Herein, a novel sandwich‐like hierarchical heterostructure of Ti 3 C 2 MXene/WO 3 is created by in situ growth of ultrathin WO 3 nanosheets onto the surface of few‐layer Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets via a one‐pot solvothermal synthesis strategy. The resultant Ti 3 C 2 /WO 3 heterostructure holds a large interface contact area, an intimate electronic interaction, and a short carrier migration distance, which is beneficial for bulk‐to‐surface and interfacial charge transfer. Meanwhile, the excellent electrical conductivity of Ti 3 C 2 and the Schottky junction at the interface of WO 3 and Ti 3 C 2 expedites the spatial charge separation and transportation. As expected, the as‐prepared Ti 3 C 2 /WO 3 nanohybrids exhibit a superior visible‐light‐driven photoactivity and stability toward tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) decomposition. Across a range of Ti 3 C 2 concentrations, 3 wt% Ti 3 C 2 /WO 3 achieves the greatest photodegradation rate of 16.08 × 10 −3 min −1 that is approximately ninefold larger than that of pristine WO 3 . In addition to the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, three TC degradation pathways are identified, highlighting the important roles of ·O 2 − and h + .

Here, 1H‐Pyrazole‐1‐carboxamidine hydrochloride (PAH) as a multifunctional heterocyclic ring‐based organic ionic salt to modify the surface of FAPbI 3 film at room temperature is demonstrated. XPS and FTIR results demonstrate that the sufficient active sites contribute to the interaction between PAH and surface Pb ions of the perovskite, which is helpful to reduce the trap states on the perovskite film so as to increase the device performance. The modification is beneficial to the suppression of charge recombination and the promotion of charge transfer by anchoring to the uncoordinated Pb ions on the surface both at the interface of stacking layers and the grain boundary. With prolonged charge carrier lifetime and elevated charge transfer, an improved PCE of 20.9% is obtained for the as‐prepared planar devices based on FAPbI 3 , along with simultaneous enhancement of open circuit voltage and fill factor. The findings further pave the way for utilizing novel organic salts for surface modification, which presents a promising route for the fabrication of efficient photovoltaic devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Favorable stability is a big challenge for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells, and all‐inorganic perovskite semiconductors have attracted much attention due to their excellent performance in this field. In reality, the poor stability is mainly due to the high‐density defects in the perovskite films, which provide a channel for charge nonradiative recombination and ion migration. In this work, a multifunctional aminoguanidine hemisulfate (AG HSUL) is introduced into the CsPbIBr 2 perovskite layer to achieve defect passivation. Guanidine cations (GA + ) can form strong hydrogen bonds with under‐coordinated halogen ions to stabilize the crystal lattice; the nitrogen atom in the amino group can form a complex with the under‐coordinated lead ion; inorganic acids and ions can not only compensate for halogen anion vacancies, but also combine with lead clusters or capped lead ions to reduce defect density. The synergistic effect of anions and cations can effectively passivate the defects, and an energy conversion efficiency of 10.10% is obtained at the optimal concentration of modification. In addition, carbon electrodes are used instead of metal electrodes, which greatly reduces the cost. The results provide a new idea for the development of efficient all‐inorganic CsPbIBr 2 perovskite solar cells.",

Such BPs, however, typically require complex manufacturing processes, resulting in higher costs and reduced eco‐friendly features. Herein, a delignification‐splicing‐based strategy without adhesives for directly converting corn ( Zea mays L.) husks to corn husk‐based plastic (CHP) is described. During this process, lignin is removed from the corn husks and the pores collapse to form a dense structure. The CHP, which combines high mechanical strength (118 MPa) and a Young's modulus of 7.8 GPa with excellent light transmittance (86%), can be prepared in large sheets and can potentially replace non‐renewable, non‐biodegradable PCPs. Each hm 2 of cornfield can generate 1.2 hm 2 of CHP annually using the strategy. The process is simple, green, scalable, and as low cost as traditional PCPs since the only consumables are corn husks, NaClO, and water. Functional CHPs, such as fluorescent or hydrophobic CHPs, can be fabricated by impregnating delignified corn husk with carbon dots before pressing or by post‐pressing hydrophobilization, respectively. This work develops an alternative green and sustainable technology for eco‐friendly BPs, adds value to agricultural waste, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to their availability, low cost, nontoxicity, and tunability, polymeric carbon nitrides (CN x ) represent one of the most attractive materials classes for the development of fully sustainable photo(electro)catalytic systems for solar‐driven water splitting. However, the development of CN x ‐based photoanodes for visible light‐driven water oxidation to dioxygen is rather challenging, particularly due to issues related to photoelectrode stability and effective coupling of the light absorber with water oxidation catalysts. Herein, a triadic photoanode comprising a porous TiO 2 electron collector scaffold sensitized by CN x coupled to a molecular cobalt polyoxometalate (CoPOM = [Co 4 (H 2 O) 2 (PW 9 O 34 ) 2 ] 10 ) catalyst is reported. Complete water oxidation to dioxygen under visible (λ &gt; 420 nm) light irradiation is demonstrated, with photocurrents down to relatively low bias potentials (0.2 V vs RHE). Furthermore, polyethyleneimine (PEI), a cationic polymer is shown to act as an effective and non‐sacrificial electrostatic linker for immobilization of the anionic CoPOM onto the negatively charged surface of CN x . The optimized deposition of CoPOM using the PEI linker translates directly into improved efficiency of the transfer of photogenerated holes to water molecules and to enhanced oxygen evolution. This work thus provides important design rules for effective immobilization of POM‐based catalysts into soft‐matter photoelectrocatalytic architectures for light‐driven water oxidation.",

Cellulosic nanocrystals (CNC) were extracted from Posidonia oceanica dead leaves, spent barely grains, and kale stems using a simplified purification protocol. These nanocrystals are used to prepare cellulosic aerogels, evaluating the effect of three parameters, namely, concentration (0.5–4%), CaCl 2 and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) incorporation (hybrid aerogels), on their sound absorption properties. Aerogels from 4% suspensions show the highest sound absorption, outperforming benchmark rockwool and polyester—two modern commonly‐used sound absorbers. Moreover, PLA coating also improves the sound absorption performance of the most aerogels. CNC from KS aerogels are selected as the optimum at both high (500–6000 Hz) and low (100–1500 Hz) frequency ranges.

    "abstract": "Abstract Zn‐ion batteries are one of the hot candidates for low‐cost and sustainable secondary batteries. The hydrogen evolution and dendritic growth upon zinc deposition are today's challenges for that technology. One of the new strategies to cope with these issues is to use “water‐in‐salt” electrolyte (WISE), that is, super concentrated aqueous electrolytes, to broaden its electrochemical stability window (ESW), suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and perturbing the dendritic growth. Herein, this work proposes to use “water‐in‐polymer salt” electrolyte (WIPSE) concept to mitigate the challenges with Zn ion batteries and bring this technology toward one of the cheapest, greenest, and most sustainable electrodes: Lignin‐carbon (L‐C) electrode. Potassium polyacrylate (PAAK) as WISE bears out as better electrolyte for L‐C electrodes in terms of self‐discharge, cyclic stability, and specific capacity compared to conventional electrolyte based on chemically cousin molecule potassium acetate. Zinc bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Zn(TFSI) 2 ) added into WIPSE shows deposition and dissolution of Zn in Zn//Zn symmetric cell suggesting that Zn 2+ are moving into the polyanionic network. Furthermore, the added bis (trifluor omethanesul fonyl) imide (TFSI − ) metal salts trigger a ≈40% enhancement of the capacity of L‐C electrode. These results show a new promising direction toward the development of cost‐effective and sustainable Zn‐lignin batteries.",

However, application of MOFs for pesticide delivery in wider agricultural context can be restricted by their granular form. Herein, an alternative approach is studied using biodegradable polymer‐MOF composites to address this limitation. The loading and release of a widely used pesticide, 2,4‐dichloropheoxycetic acid (2,4‐D), is studied using two MOFs, UiO‐66 and UiO‐66‐NH 2 , and the 2,4‐D‐loaded MOFs are incorporated into biodegradable polycaprolactone composites for convenient handling and minimizing runoff. The MOFs are loaded by in‐situ, and post‐synthetic methods, and characterised thoroughly to ensure successful synthesis and loading of 2,4‐D. The pesticide release studies are performed on the MOFs and composites in distilled water, and analysed using UV‐Vis spectroscopy, demonstrating sustained‐release of 2,4‐D over 16 days. The loaded MOF samples show high loading capacity, with up to 45 wt% for the in‐situ loaded UiO‐66. Release kinetics show more sustained release of 2,4‐D from UiO‐66‐NH 2 compared to UiO‐66, which can be due to supramolecular interactions between the NH 2 group of UiO‐66‐NH 2 and 2,4‐D.

The synthetic methods for CoOOH, including wet‐chemical oxidation method, electrochemical oxidation method, molten‐salt‐assisted synthesis and hydrothermal method will be reviewed and compared. Moreover, the strategies will be summarized for design active CoOOH‐based OER catalysts such as element doping and construction of hybrid catalysts in detail. Finally, an outlook is provided about the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 5‐Hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) obtained from biomass can be converted to 2,5‐diformylfuran (DFF), a valuable chemical intermediate. However, the typical HMF oxidation process requires energy consumption such as high temperature and oxygen pressure. Herein, Au 2 S decorated CdS nanowires (denoted as Au 2 S@CdS NWs) are fabricated by a simple ion exchange method and applied as a heterostructure photocatalyst system for HMF oxidation under mild conditions. Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic performance of Au 2 S@CdS NWs is significantly enhanced compared with pristine CdS NWs, in which Au 2 S (0.25%)@CdS NWs achieve the high DFF yield (≈95%) for 4 h reaction time. This result means that the heterogeneous interface formed between CdS NWs and Au 2 S promotes the separation efficiency of photogenerated charges, which leads to high catalytic activity. Moreover, Au 2 S (0.25%)@CdS NWs work well for HMF conversion to DFF under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Control experiments and characterization are conducted to investigate each reaction mechanism. Consequently, it is found that the photogenerated hole directly oxidizes HMF to DFF under anaerobic conditions and the 1 O 2 produced from oxygen is the active species for HMF conversion to DFF under aerobic conditions.",

Herein, a new method of production of vegetable‐waste‐derived biocomposites is developed. It consists of the thermomechanical processing of different residues in the presence of small amounts of water, representing an advancement in the state‐of‐the‐art in the complete conversion of fruit and vegetable biomass into biocomposites. In particular, carrot pomace (CP) is processed by compression molding at different temperatures, pressures, and times. Selected processing conditions are also applied to other food processing byproducts. The morphological, mechanical, barrier, optical, and antioxidant properties of the obtained biocomposites and their interaction with water in terms of moisture content, water solubility, and moisture absorption are reported here. Results indicate that biocomposites obtained by this method present similar properties compared to biocomposites prepared by acid or alkaline hydrolysis of biomass reported in the literature, but still inferior compared to bioplastics currently in the market. Improvements in the materials' interaction with water are highlighted here as the necessary next step to achieving the transition toward greener bioplastics.",

A comprehensive investigation is performed to evaluate the compatible and non‐compatible recycled polypropylene (PP)/polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) blends combined with functional (electrical, piezoelectric,and dielectric) materials for in‐situ fibril production. The nanocompositefibrils made from recycled PP, PET and GNPs/BaTiO 3 with high‐aspect ratio disparity (400:1) are produced, which exhibit significantly enhanced electrical, thermomechanical, and electromagnetic characteristics. Single‐screw extrusion is utilised to fabricate the fibrils with the in‐situ fibril morphology of PET and GNPs/BaTiO 3 leading to improved electrical conductivity. It is demonstrated that such fibril morphology restricts the chain mobility of polymer molecules, and ultimately increases viscosity and strain energy. Moreover, the study demonstrates a positive reinforcement effect from the utilisation of PET fibrils and GNPs/BaTiO 3 in a PP matrix, dominated by the high‐aspect ratio, stiffness, and thermal stability of GNPs/BaTiO 3 . Furthermore, it is observed that the mechanical properties and tension‐bearing capacity of the PP are significantly improved by such incorporation. The study also demonstrates that the protection of the remanufactured nanocomposites against electromagnetic interference is significantly improved with the increasing GNPs/BaTiO 3 content and the morphological transition from spherical to fibril‐shaped PET.",

Breakthroughs in the commercialization of PSCs is achieved continuously. Therefore, the recovery of decommissioned devices that are closely related to the commercialization is extremely urgent. More importantly, lead (Pb) and other materials in PSCs are ecotoxic and biotoxic. Due to improper disposal of the decommissioned devices, serious heavy metal Pb and solid waste pollution incidents may occur. In fact, PSCs contain a great deal of recyclable and valuable materials. To achieve the goal of sustainable PSCs, recycling and reusing these useful materials are advocated. In this review, the authors retrospect structures and key materials of PSCs briefly. Benefits of recycling useful materials from the decommissioned PSCs are analyzed in terms of environmental and economic profits, including reducing the material costs, saving energy, reducing negative environmental impacts and conserving natural resources. Research progresses on recycling and reusing the useful materials are summarized and discussed from the perspectives of feasible pathways, recovery solvents, recovery effects and performance analysis of the corresponding devices.

Multiple end‐of‐life strategies must be implemented to minimize environmental impacts and retain valuable plastic material, but it is challenging to compare options that generate products with different lifetimes and utilities. Herein, they present a material flow model equipped with consequential life cycle assessment, cost analysis, and a plastic circularity indicator that considers product quality and lifetime. The model is used to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, circularity, and cost of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle mechanical downcycling to lower‐quality resin, closed‐loop glycolysis to food‐grade PET, upcycling to glass fiber‐reinforced plastic, and conversion to non‐plastic products (electricity, oil) on a United States economy‐wide basis for the year 2020. A brute force algorithm suggests that a combination of 68% glycolysis, 11% mechanical recycling, 6% upcycling, 9% landfilling, and 5% incineration can minimize the cost and GHG emissions and maximize the circularity of the current PET economy. However, uncertainty around transportation distances, materials recovery facility efficiencies, and recycling yields can result in different “optimal” pathway mixes. This flexible framework enables informed decision‐making to move toward a cost‐ and environment‐conscious circular economy for plastic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Increasing development of wind and solar generation in the power sector can create economic opportunities for the deployment of water electrolyzers that produce hydrogen. Temporal variation in the marginal cost of energy in future decarbonized grids can make it favorable for electrolyzers to dispatchably ramp hydrogen production up and down in response to low‐ and high‐cost times. Using this strategy, low‐cost hydrogen production is enabled by electrolyzers that are low‐capital cost and tolerant to frequent on/off cycling. Ramping down hydrogen production to a designated turndown ratio can avoid performance degradation caused by on/off cycling by not shutting the electrolyzer completely off. This comes with a slight cost penalty which can be minimized if the turndown ratio is low (i.e., the system ramps down hydrogen production to close to zero). These results suggest that electrolyzers integrated into future power systems are likely to benefit from the ability to ramp operation up and down quickly and operate in a standby mode. This analysis forms a basis for comparative tradeoffs between electrolyzer capital cost, operating strategy, and system durability and demonstrates the importance of considering all three factors in technoeconomic analysis.",

Therefore, strategies to limit fungicide usage are of paramount importance. Trichoderma fungi, due to their antagonistic activity against various pathogenic fungi, have shown potential as a sustainable alternative to chemical fungicides. However, bio‐control agents like Trichoderma are vulnerable to physical stimuli and show diminished efficacy during prolonged storage. To address these challenges, a mild and scalable encapsulation method for Trichoderma spores is introduced, employing a layer‐by‐layer (LbL) approach using biobased lignin derivatives. It is demonstrated that the LbL encapsulation technique significantly improved spore stability relative to naked spores, even under adverse conditions including extreme temperatures and prolonged exposure to Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Notably, encapsulated Trichoderma spores showed enhanced efficacy in cultivating tomato plants compared to naked spores. Additionally, the findings revealed that the in planta efficacy of encapsulated spores is dependent on the specific Trichoderma strain used. This study suggests that Trichoderma spores encapsulated with lignin through the LbL approach, are a promising and sustainable alternative to chemical fungicides with potential for commercialization.",

It involves the conversion of waste from different bio‐based sources such as cellulose waste from farming and forestry leftovers, chitin waste from seafood and mushrooms, and keratin waste from hair, nails, and feathers into natural fibers. These fibers are then effectively mixed with other materials to create composite materials having unique properties, such as high strength and stiffness, good thermal and electrical conductivity, and better barrier properties. Developing these materials is not just good for the environment because it reduces landfill waste and the reliance on non‐renewable resources, but it can also make economic sense for producers. In this review, the basic compounds of natural fibers and the development of composite materials from them are explored and discussed in detail. Furthermore, their chemical and mechanical properties are discussed and summarized.

In contrast to conventional cleaning methods, advanced oil sorbents present a promising technology characterized by low cost, reduced environmental impact, and exceptional hydrophobicity and oleophilic properties for efficient oil removal from seawater. Despite these advantages, the efficacy of sorbents is hindered by highly viscous oil, impeding the oil/water separation process. To overcome this limitation, solar‐driven sorbents incorporating semiconductor materials are innovatively developed, leveraging increased temperatures to enhance crude oil absorption by reducing viscosity. Herein, a comprehensive review specifically focuses on various semiconductor‐functionalized sorbents for oil spill remediation, elucidating oil weathering and traditional cleaning methods to underscore the complexities and challenges in oil cleaning processes. An in‐depth discussion about the cleaning mechanisms of sorbents and the photothermal conversion processes facilitated by semiconductors is also provided. Additionally, it explores three coupling strategies—Joule heating and solar heating, photothermal effect, and magnetic effect, as well as photothermal and photocatalysis—that offer significant advancements in oil cleanup efficiency. Concluding with forward‐looking insights, the challenges and perspectives for the next generation of ocean oil spill removal technologies are proposed at the end.",

One main advantage of inkjet printing for the fabrication of HP thin films is its ability to produce uniform films with controlled thickness and high coverage, which is critical for achieving high‐performance devices. Additionally, inkjet printing allows for the deposition of patterned thin films, enabling the fabrication of complex device architectures such as light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). In this work, flexible LEDs based on inkjet printed Pb‐free HP thiophene‐ethylammonium tin iodide (TEA 2 SnI 4 ) are produced that has gained attention as a potential alternative to Pb‐based HPs in optoelectronic devices due to its lower toxicity, environmental impact, and high performance.

In this study, a sustainable approach to augmenting urea‐formaldehyde (UF) resins, widely employed in wood‐based panels is introduced. Addressing this, formaldehyde‐scavenger demethylated lignin nanoparticles into UF resins, aiming to produce a green and enhanced medium‐density‐fiberboard (MDF) with minimal formaldehyde emissions is incorporated. The results indicate that increasing concentrations of demethylated lignin nanoparticles in the UF adhesive, there is not only a reduction in formaldehyde emissions from MDF composites but also a significant decrease in thickness swelling. The highest reduction in formaldehyde emission is observed in the MDF composite prepared with UF resin containing 7% lignin nanoparticles (UF‐7NL), with an emission of 2.9 mg/100 g, marking a substantial decrease of 74% compared to emission of 11.2 mg/100 g from neat resin. Importantly, this reduction does not compromise physical and mechanical properties of the MDF; they remain comparable to boards bonded with unmodified UF. Molecular modeling revealed that lignin effectively traps formaldehyde, incorporating it as ‐CH 2 OH groups, leading to a notable decrease in formaldehyde emission from MDF. This approach offers an eco‐friendly modification to a common polymer, showcasing lignin nanoparticles as innovative additives.",

First, polymeric membranes are prepared via the phase‐inversion method using commercial PVB as the backbone and 4,4′‐methylenebis(cyclohexylisocyanate) as a crosslinking agent. They are characterized from a physicochemical viewpoint by thermomechanical analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, and are successfully tested as separators in Li‐metal cells with LP30 electrolyte. Electrical and electrochemical properties are evaluated by impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling, providing comparable results with commercial Celgard 25 µm monolayer microporous polypropylene separator. As a proof‐of‐concept, for the first time, recycled PVB‐based polymer membranes from wasted car glasses are prepared, adjusting the synthesis protocol to account for the presence of plasticizers and contaminants. They show a dense elastomeric appearance and proved to be compatible with Li metal and stable upon 600 h of Li plating/stripping. The electrochemical window is compatible with the LiFePO 4 cathode, as demonstrated by prolonged galvanostatic cycling (250 cycles) in laboratory‐scale cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract The effective removal of complex pollutants is extremely challenging for environmental and material science, especially pollutants including detergents and pesticides do not decompose or degrade in the aquatic environment which cannot be easily removed. Here, a novel biocompatible superparamagnetic nanocomposite integrating the advantages of porous silicon nanoparticles is developed, the chelation ability of chitosan, and graphene‐oxide‐iron that can simultaneously adsorb complex hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants on their internal and external surfaces which have significantly improved pollutant removal efficiency over the current existing methods. A porous silicon nanoparticle (PSi) conjugated magnetite‐chitosan‐reduced graphene oxide (MCRGO) nanoparticles (PSi‐MCRGO) are synthesized for complete removal of detergent, pesticide, and toxic heavy metals cadmium and lead ions from water at a favorable room temperature. The adsorption behavior of the nanocomposites fits well with the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo‐second‐order kinetics model by adsorption mechanism. Moreover, the fresh and recycled nanocomposites are easily separated by an external magnetic field for reusability due to super magnetite response and show high binding capacity for toxic heavy metal ions. Furthermore, the nanocomposites are biocompatible and reusable, and for the fourth time, recycled nanocomposites can completely remove toxic heavy metals. Overall, the novel nanocomposites completely remove complex pollutants which hold great potential for real water treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As awareness of the environmental impact of fossil‐based polymers grows, the demand for biobased alternatives rises. In this context, combining eco‐friendly synthesis techniques with renewable resources is important to produce polymers efficiently and sustainably. Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is one of the key building blocks for producing biobased polymers. However, most studies predominantly focus on 2,5‐FDCA, while FDCA encompasses other noteworthy isomers, namely, 2,4‐ and 3,4‐FDCA. The polymers derived from these two isomers have recently gained attention due to their promising properties. In this study, an environmentally friendly approach for producing biobased polyesters from 2,5‐, 2,4‐, and 3,4‐FDCA dimethyl ester isomers is proposed. The synthesis is conducted under greener conditions, utilizing Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) enzyme as a biocatalyst. The performance of the enzyme is assessed, revealing CALB preference for polymerizing 2,5‐FDCA over 2,4‐ and 3,4‐FDCA dimethyl ester, which is elucidated by docking analysis. Moreover, CALB shows varying rates of cyclic oligomer formation for each isomer, favoring 2,5‐FDCA cyclization. The structure‐property relationship, encompassing the variation in isomeric structure, is evaluated through structural characterization, thermal analysis, and surface properties. This study primarily emphasized enzymatic polymerization and highlighted its versatility in accommodating different monomer isomeric substitutions.",

Achieving high evaporation rates while employing accessible and renewable materials is key focus in this field. Here, a 3D cylindrical‐shaped solar evaporator composed of natural cellulose is fabricated through ice‐templating freezing combined with crosslinking gelation. It demonstrates an evaporation rate of 4.2 kg m −2 h −1 under 1 sun irradiation, and reaches an energy efficiency of 173%, surpassing most reported cellulose/wood‐based evaporators. This enhanced performance is facilitated by absorbing energy from surrounding, possessing connected pores, and reducing the evaporation enthalpy. Moreover, a systematic exploration of the correlation between pore size and evaporation performance reveals that the reduced pore size (several micrometers) does not necessarily result in a higher evaporation rate, despite improving the fluid transportation. The interaction between water and cellulose induces the formation of intermediate water and reduces the evaporation enthalpy by more than 35%. Thus, the final evaporation performance is determined by a synergistic effect involving water transport, hydrophilicity, and vaporization enthalpy. Giving the high evaporation rate achieved, this 3D cellulose‐based solar evaporator presents a promising candidate toward a high‐throughput, eco‐friendly solar steam generation devices, aligning well with the criteria of green and sustainable development.",

In this study, GDY‐CuI is synthesized by cross‐coupling method, and the wide bandgap ZnWO 4 is introduced into it by low‐temperature mixing, which effectively constructed the GDY‐CuI/ZW‐50 double S‐scheme heterojunction. The optimized GDY‐CuI/ZW‐50 catalyst photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance reached 308.61 µmol after 5 h of visible light irradiation, which is 12.86 and 6.56 times than that of GDY‐CuI and ZnWO 4 , respectively. The improved efficiency of hydrogen evolution is attributed to the formation of a double S‐scheme heterojunction between GDY, CuI, and ZnWO 4 and an internal electric field, which promotes charge transfer, reduces the complexation rate of photogenerated electrons, and enhances the redox capacity of photogenerated charges. A combination of photoelectrochemical analysis, in situ X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (In situ XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and density functional theory (DFT) results revealed the electron transfer mechanism.

    "abstract": "Abstract The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is imperative to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable development goals (SGDs). Hydrogen, as a clean energy carrier, holds great potential for decarbonizing various sectors, yet its production remains predominantly reliant on fossil fuels. This study explores a novel approach to sustainable hydrogen production by integrating offshore wind energy with reverse osmosis (RO) desalination technology. The proposed configuration harnesses offshore wind power to energize both a RO desalination system and water electrolysis unit. Initially, the wind energy powers the RO desalination process, purifying seawater, and then desalinated water is directed to water electrolysis system for generating green hydrogen directly from seawater. The resulting renewable hydrogen holds potential for diverse applications, including marine industries, and can be transported onshore as needed. The RO system is configured to treat 20 kg s −1 of seawater with a salinity of 35 000 ppm, aiming for a high recovery ratio and reduced freshwater salinity. A pressure exchanger (PX) is integrated to recover energy from high‐pressure brine stream and transfer it to the low‐pressure feed water, thus reducing the overall energy consumption of the RO process. The concentrated brine extracted from RO desalination is proposed to be utilized for the production of sodium hydroxide that can further pretreat incoming seawater and enhance the effectiveness of the filtration process by mitigating membrane fouling. This pressure exchanger increases the energy efficiency of the RO system from 63.1% to 64.0% and exergetic efficiency from 13.9% to 18.2% increasing the overall first and second law efficiencies to 37.9% and 33.5%. By leveraging offshore wind power to drive RO desalination systems, this research not only addresses freshwater scarcity but also facilitates green hydrogen generation, contributing to the advancement of renewable energy solutions and fostering environmental sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are crucial for achieving sustainable energy goals due to their high energy density and long cycle life. They dominate markets like consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage systems. However, current LIBs use liquid electrolytes, which are toxic, flammable, and their liquid state does not resist dendrite growth, causing battery capacity decline and failure. Additionally, the limited availability of lithium and other metals makes liquid‐based LIBs less sustainable. On the other hand, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer a safer alternative as they are non‐volatile and can resist dendrite growth. However, ion transport in solids is much more restricted than in liquids, while imperfect solid‐solid interfaces contribute to interfacial resistance leading to lower ionic conductivity and increasing Ohmic losses or requiring battery operation at elevated temperatures. Chemical and mechanical degradation of these interfaces can also result in battery capacity fade, and poorer cyclic performance compared to liquid electrolytes. Understanding the ionic transport mechanisms in SPEs is critical for designing and optimizing the nanostructure of polymers and polymer/electrode interfaces to overcome these limitations. In this review, the fundamental mechanisms of ion transport in SPEs will first be explored. Various state‐of‐the‐art approaches for addressing the key challenges in SPEs and their solutions are then discussed. Furthermore, the current status of SPEs is analyzed to determine their potential for replacing liquid electrolytes in the future.",

Green hydrogen is also responsible for water consumption and for land use, while offshore platforms may be responsible for the loss of marine biodiversity. Another potential environmental hotspot is the depletion of rare metals and critical materials employed in the electrolyzer and in the power generation plants.

    "abstract": "Abstract A well‐designed solvothermal approach has been employed to synthesize olivine LiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 PO 4 (LMFP) cathode material with a nanoplate configuration. This method precisely controls crystal growth to achieve a high proportion of (010) facets while minimizing intrinsic defects. These modifications significantly enhance lithium‐ion diffusion kinetics and optimize the electrochemical performance of LMFP. The nanoscale of the (010) facets and the reduced anti‐site defect concentration in the MP‐PRO sample functionalize jointly to promote lithium‐ion transport during the long‐cycle. Furthermore, the superior electrochemical performance is closely linked with significantly reduced impedance and enhanced Mn redox kinetics. Both theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that the confinement effect induced by 1,3‐propanediol directs facet orientation and confines nanoplate growth. Compared to the product synthesized using water (MP‐H 2 O), the 1,3‐propanediol‐based sample (MP‐PRO) delivers a high specific capacity of 130.7 mAh g −1 at 5C and demonstrates excellent cycling stability, with an 84.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. This study provides new insights into the kinetics of Mn redox in LMFP electrodes and reveals an effective electrode structure design to realize long‐life high rate batteries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an eminent technology and has become a promising solution for the existing energy crises. Several methods are investigated to enhance the TENG output performance. Herein, a novel pentaerythritol (core) and dimethylol butanoic acid (monomer)‐based hyperbranched polymer of second generation (HBP‐G2) is fabricated by facile single‐step polycondensation technique. Further, different weight percentages (5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%) of HBP‐G2‐blended polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)‐based nanofibers (NFs) are prepared using the traditional electrospinning technique. The prepared HBP‐G2 and the electrospun NFs are characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM)/energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X‐ray diffraction (XRD)light emitting diodes studies. The effect of HBP‐G2 on the triboelectric performance of PVDF is evaluated in terms of open circuit potential (V oc ) and short circuit current (I sc ) using aluminium as the counter electrode. Among all, the 20 wt% of PVDF/HBP‐G2 shows the superior performance of V oc of 241 V (ten times of neat PVDF NF) and I sc of 5.3 µA (six times of neat PVDF NF). The optimized 20 wt% TENG device (PVDF/G2‐PA‐20) exhibits a peak power density of 0.17 Wm −2 at an applied load resistance of 100 MΩ.

    "abstract": "Abstract Transition metal oxides like Co, Ni, and Mn are promising alternatives to noble metals such as Pt for oxygen electrocatalysis in green energy. Alloying these metals forms multicomponent catalysts with compelling properties. In this study, CoCrFeNi and MnCrFeNi thin films are synthesized using High‐Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) and their catalytic activity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and corrosion resistance in 1 molar (1 M) potassium hydroxide (KOH) are evaluated. MnCrFeNi films exhibit a fine‐grained single face‐centered cubic (FCC) phase, while CoCrFeNi films have larger grains and multiple phases. ORR on CoCrFeNi follows a 2+1 electron transfer pathway, producing hydroxide radicals, while MnCrFeNi exhibits a 2‐electron pathway, yielding hydrogen peroxide. Anodization reduces the CoCrFeNi overpotential from 0.9 to 0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), comparable to platinum and iridium catalysts (Pt/C, Ir/C). Anodization also shifts CoCrFeNi ORR to a 2‐electron pathway. In situ Raman spectroscopy detects no ORR intermediates, but nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) appears during OER. Substituting Mn for Co increases corrosion resistance by raising the corrosion potential. All films show passive behavior during polarization, demonstrating their potential for corrosion protection and electrocatalysis in green energy applications.",

However, current photocatalytic membranes are encountering the issues of poor mechanical property in non‐elastic fiber and low charge carrier separation efficiency in non‐conductive polymer. Through improving thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) precursor dissolution and adding conductive polyaniline (PANI) respectively before and after electrospinning, TiO 2 ‐based elastic conductive (EC) TPU membranes with higher mechanical strength and photocatalytic performance are created, compared to traditional inelastic non‐conductive (IN) membrane, even to inelastic conductive (IC) membrane. The nanofibers in the TiO 2 EC membrane have a relatively rough surface structure, which exposes more catalytic sites. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectrum (UPS) test results show that the work function ( φ ) of TiO 2 in EC membrane becomes lower than in IN and IC membranes, leading to the strongest electron transfer potential for photocatalytic reactions. For the photocatalytic degradation of Methyl Orange (MO), the TiO 2 EC membrane demonstrates the best degradation rate of 49.43% over 3 days among three samples. These findings suggest that the TiO 2 EC membrane is promising for in‐site micropollutant water treatment in the real‐world.",

Citric acid (CA), a biodegradable chelating agent, forms stable complexes with both metals, which can be extracted from contaminated sediments through ex situ sediment washing. A solar photocatalytic method has been developed to separate toxic metals from wastewater and degrade CA. Increasing the TiO 2 photocatalyst load enhances arsenic adsorption under dark conditions. Total arsenic removal is achieved during photocatalytic decontamination using 1000 ppm of TiO 2 . Fe(III)–hydroxides formed in the presence of Fe(III) further adsorb arsenic. Nearly total arsenic removal is achieved even under seawater conditions and visible light irradiation only. The removal of arsenic in different oxidation states has been successfully demonstrated. The UV–vis/TiO 2 /CA photocatalytic system has also proven highly effective for mercury removal from wastewater. Although seawater conditions slightly slow the removal process, complete mercury removal is achieved even under visible light irradiation. Finally, a combined photocatalytic approach has been developed for the removal of both arsenic and mercury, achieving 100% removal within few minutes of light irradiation. The reaction mechanism has been depicted based on intermediates and reaction products detected during the photocatalytic process.",

The developed CP is used as a raw material to obtain CF via free‐radical emulsion polymerization using maleic anhydride and oleic acrylic resins. Thereafter, a foam‐based extinguishing agent (FP) with ideal flame retardant properties is synthesized by blending the obtained CF with common and fluorine‐containing (sodium perfluoro nonyloxybenzenesulfonate) surfactants. The prepared materials are characterized using Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, fire‐extinguishing effect, and other analytical techniques. Results show that the synthesized FP exhibited good thermal and chemical stabilities as well as considerably low cytotoxicity and biotoxicity. A spreading test and preliminary fire‐extinguishing test on an oil surface indicated that the FP has a relatively high spreading speed and good air‐insulation performance. In particular, compared with that of a traditional extinguishing agent, the full spreading time of 7‐FP is 40% lower, with the total extinguishing time being 28 s. Overall, the results suggested that the prepared CP materials are effective extinguishing agents and may have notable value in various fireproofing applications.",

Herein, using multimodal nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), time‐of‐flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF‐SIMS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we reveal that the composites contain IL‐rich domains extending across hundreds of nanometres within the ionene matrix, and these bicontinuous domains span the entire membrane depth. CO 2 also absorbs into the ionene matrix, with the distribution between two CO 2 species varying with temperature and time. The rotational correlation times of these two species are on the timescale of 0.1 and 1 ns, respectively. As IL content increases, the ionic domains expand, resulting in higher CO 2 solubility due to enhanced molecular dynamics and increased free volume in both ionene backbones and IL‐rich regions. Although CO 2 diffusion in the membranes is an order of magnitude slower than in bulk IL, the activation energy for CO 2 diffusion remains comparable. Ionene‐IL composites represent a promising platform for designing CO 2 separation membranes, offering enhanced CO 2 diffusion and selectivity through IL‐rich domains, and increased CO 2 solubility and mechanical integrity from the ionene matrix.",

Paper straws, as alternatives, suffer from weak mechanical strength, poor water/beverage stability, and lack of bendability. Here, an all‐natural plastic substitute is fabricated using a top‐down approach. After lignin is selectively removed from a natural wood slice, the delignified wood is infiltrated with chitosan solution. The chitosan‐infiltrated wood, in its wet state, is highly flexible, moldable, and can be rolled into desired shapes. After drying, strong hydrogen bonds form at the cellulose/chitosan interfaces, making it an all‐natural plastic substitute. By enclosing two sides using a chitosan adhesive, an all‐natural straw is produced with a superior mechanical strength of 242 MPa, higher than polypropylene and paper straws. After baking, the all‐natural straws show high water stability and maintain high mechanical strength in water (136 MPa) and carbonated beverages (71 MPa) for &gt;2 days. A water‐moldable process also creates accordion‐like joints, giving the all‐natural straws superior bendability (120°) and compressibility (50%). The all‐natural straws exhibit high biocompatibility, full biodegradability in 5 months, and high circularity. Overall, the eco‐friendly fabrication of all‐natural straws holds great potential in addressing the ongoing pollution of plastic straws.",

Heterostructure materials, with their unique interfaces, robust architectures, and synergistic effects, show great promise in enhancing energy conversion and storage capabilities.

This study introduces a novel diode‐type interfacial micro‐junction fabricated from FeCo‐based layered double hydroxide (LDH) using a self‐sacrificial template‐induced method. The micro‐junction structure significantly enhances the material's electronic properties, enabling efficient charge separation and ion transport. As a result, the material demonstrates remarkable performance in both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and supercapacitor applications. Specifically, the optimized material exhibits superior specific capacitance (1814.14 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ), high energy density (61.6 Wh kg −1 ), and excellent cycling stability (90.7% capacitance retention after 15 000 cycles) in coin cell supercapacitors. Additionally, the material's unique light‐harvesting capabilities and enhanced charge‐carrier dynamics make it a promising candidate for photocatalytic H 2 evolution at a rate of 577.8 µmol h −1 .

In this work, inspiration is taken from biomedical and pharmaceutical research and crosslinked pectin‐based edible composite coatings are developed for the preservation of butter. Pectin is blended with gelatin and glutathione to induce antioxidant characteristics and crosslinked with calcium chloride to overcome the problem of moisture sensitivity of neat pectin‐based coatings. The blended active edible coatings exhibit significant preservation characteristics in coated butter in terms of peroxide, acid, and fatty acid values during the 60 days storage period with 15 days examination intervals in a calcium chloride dose dependent response. Furthermore, the developed coatings exhibit significantly improved antioxidant properties as assessed from β‐carotene and 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity in coated samples compared to control prolonging the shelf‐life of coated butter. For the first time, it is demonstrated that pectin can be crosslinked to prepare edible coatings and extent of crosslinking can directly influence coating performance in food preservation.

However, a comprehensive and authoritative sustainable development goal (SDG) indicator framework is currently lacking at the city level. To address this gap, we first developed an integrated framework comprising 357 indicators for 297 Chinese cities through a literature review. Nevertheless, the sheer number of reviewed indicators presents significant challenges in data collection. The study then used principal component analysis and multiple regression to identify a small set of SDG indicators (principal indicators) with the consideration of data collection difficulty. Finally, we tested their effectiveness up to 2030. The key findings of our study are as follows: 1) 187 principal indicators are identified to explain the 90% variance of all the 357 indicators with lowest data collection difficulty, providing comprehensive coverage of the SDGs and achieving efficient information aggregation; 2) these principal indicators demonstrated good variance effectiveness and data availability in the vast majority of cities (284 out of 297), highlighting priority areas for future data infrastructure development; 3) the continued applicability of these principal indicators up to 2030 is validated.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the realm of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) is a material that holds great promise as a substitute for platinum (Pt), which is both expensive and scarce. The restricted number of active sites and low conductivity of MoS 2 have an impact on its catalytic efficiency, however, which hampers the application of MoS 2 ‐based catalysts in practical catalytic hydrogen production. The integrated Van der Waals (vdW) engineering and morphology engineering hold the potential to effectively boost hydrogen evolution on MoS 2 . Herein, hierarchical nanotubes (MoS 2 /N‐doped‐C) assembled from MoS 2 nanosheets sandwiched by N‐doped‐C layers are synthesized utilizing an integration of hydrothermal and annealing. The 3D hierarchical structure with stepped edges, produced by directly integrating carbon layers into the MoS 2 interlayers, enhances the catalytic activity and stability of the HER compared to MoS 2 scattered on conductive carriers. The experimental results demonstrate that MoS 2 /N‐doped‐C shows excellent electrocatalytic HER activity under acidic conditions, exhibiting an extremely small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec −1 , an extremely low overpotential of 41 mV at a geometric current density of 10 mA cm −2 , and maintaining durability for more than 100 h.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The formation of lithium (Li) dendrites on the anode during charge and discharge poses a significant challenge to the scalability of lithium‐metal batteries (LMBs). This study presents an innovative strategy leveraging waste‐derived Zn to create a hybrid in/ex situ artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) layer. The hybrid ASEI layer significantly improves the electrochemical performance of Li anodes compared to uncoated Li. In symmetrical cells, it demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining a low overpotential of 9 mV over 400 cycles with a charge transfer resistance of 10.4 Ω, attributed to the high Li‐ion diffusivity provided by the ASEI layer. Unlike the bare Li, which develops a rough, thick, and uneven surface with cracks and dendrites after extended cycling, the ASEI‐coated anode exhibits a smooth and uniform surface. Furthermore, chemical analysis during cycling confirms the dynamic formation of beneficial LiZn within the ASEI layer. The performance of waste‐derived ASEI layer is examined in the real condition by pairing it with sulfur cathode. The cell delivers a remarkable specific discharge capacity of 1085 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.1C and retains 68% of its initial capacity after 300 cycles at 0.2C, outperforming bare Li, which retains only 54% under the same conditions.",

A scalable Ionized Jet Deposition (IJD) technique is employed to deposit MoS₂ onto various carbon supports, exploring the relationship between substrate properties and catalytic performance. The results demonstrate that substrate choice plays a pivotal role in enhancing HER activity and durability. MoS₂ deposited on Freudenberg carbon support exhibited the best catalytic activity, achieving a current density of 10 mA µg⁻¹Mo at −0.48 V versus RHE in an alkaline environment, even with a low catalyst loading (12–49 µg cm⁻ 2 ). Conversely, sulfur‐doped carbon supports showed lower HER activity but superior stability, with a minimal voltage degradation of just 0.025 V after 6 h of testing at 10 mA cm⁻ 2 . To further understand these results, bubble evolution studies, and contact angle measurements are conducted. Stable electrodes demonstrated small contact angles and enhanced bubble release from the surface, indicating the importance of hydrophilicity in improving performance and durability. This work highlights the synergy between scalable synthesis techniques and substrate optimization, offering a promising path for advancing cost‐efficient, durable electrocatalysts in large‐scale AEM electrolyzers for green hydrogen production.",

The adsorption kinetic experiments indicate that the adsorption process follows the pseudo‐second‐order kinetics model, and the Weber‐Morris intraparticle diffusion model reveals the diffusion mechanism. Additionally, in the presence of NaCl and humic acid, the hydrogel still maintains a high adsorption rate, and there is no significant decline in adsorption across different environmental water qualities, indicating that the hydrogel has great application potential.

In this study, a high‐loading dry‐casting electrode (DCE) approach is proposed to overcome these challenges by eliminating solvent use and improving electrode uniformity. The DCE, fabricated using polyvinylidene fluoride‐co‐hexafluoropropylene (PVdF‐HFP) binder nanoparticles, improves binder distribution among the natural graphite particles, enhances lithium‐ion transport, and mitigates interfacial reactions. Electrochemical analysis reveals that the DCE outperforms the WCE, particularly under high loading conditions (≈7 mAh cm −2 ). The pouch‐type full‐cell test exhibits a 67.8% capacity retention after 700 cycles, indicating stable cell cycling. Consequently, this study highlights the potential of DCE to improve capacity retention, enhance rate capability, and reduce electrode degradation for commercial applications.",

The synergistic coupling between the metal phosphide and the support material plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall catalytic activity as well as the recovery of the catalyst. Herein, this study reports nickel phosphide (Ni 2 P) and graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) nanosheets as an interfacial catalyst for the effective and efficient transfer hydrogenation of quinoline. The significance of the developed interface between Ni 2 P and GCN is revealed by the detailed spectroscopic and theoretical investigations, which enhances the dissociation of hydrogen source and the substrate interaction with the surface of the catalyst, thereby enhancing the selective transformation of quinoline to 1,2,3,4‐tetrahydroquinoline. In the proposed transfer hydrogenation protocol for quinoline, formic acid is utilized as a bio‐renewable hydrogen source, which serves as a potential replacement for molecular hydrogen. Further, detailed optimization studies are carried out to achieve good selectivity and product yield by varying reaction parameters. Therefore, using detailed mechanistic studies, the nickel phosphide supported on graphitic carbon nitride (Ni 2 P‐GCN) catalyst provides a promising reaction protocol for the transfer hydrogenation of quinoline.",

This study reports the production of formaldehyde‐free wood bio‐adhesive using hydrochar from hydrothermal carbonization of SS aided by sodium periodate (NaIO4) oxidation. The performance of the bio‐adhesives can meet the requirements of the Chinese National Standard GB/T 9846‐2015 (≥0.7 MPa). The aldehyde group forms after NaIO4 treatment of sewage sludge hydrochar, which should benefit adhesion performance. However, the oxidation process also breaks some polysaccharides' carbon chains, disrupting the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) structure in hydrochar and forming small molecular compounds. As a result, the wet shear strength value of bio‐adhesive decreases, but the water resistance increases. Nevertheless, the interaction between active functional groups (e.g., between the aldehyde and amine groups) in bio‐adhesives during hot‐pressing treatment promotes adhesion performance. In addition, after doping polyethyleneimine, the cross‐linked network in bio‐adhesives can be further enhanced, improving the wet shear strength and water resistance. Hence, introducing active functional groups is the key step to bio‐adhesives, proving NaIO4 oxidation as a novel and practical approach to valorize sewage sludge for producing formaldehyde‐free adhesives.",

The synthesized DFNS (dendritic fibrous nanosilica) mesoporous silica spheres display a distinctive fibrous structure and uniform distribution. Characterization of the ZIS/DFNS nanocomposites confirms the presence of ZIS and amorphous SiO 2 . The material exhibits notable optoelectronic properties and charge separation by forming an M‐S‐Si (M = Zn, In) interface, making it suitable for photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light. 20%ZIS/DFNS nanocomposite alone achieves a hydrogen generation of 5770.54 µmol g −1 . However, when combined with Pt as a co‐catalyst, the hydrogen generation significantly increases to 9887.84 µmol g −1 over 5 h, using Na 2 S and Na 2 SO 3 as a hole scavenger. This enhancement is due to DFNS's exceptional light‐harvesting ability, which results from multiple light‐scattering events, as well as the efficient dispersion of ZIS on its fibrous surface. This dispersion enhances water diffusion and interaction with active catalytic sites.

    "abstract": "Abstract Zinc‐based batteries are emerging as promising alternatives to mainstream technologies due to their superior safety, cost‐effectiveness, and abundance of raw materials. However, zinc anodes, exhibit insufficient cycle life and low utilization in aqueous electrolytes, mainly owing to shape change and passivation. While nanostructuring of Zn anodes has been explored for Zn‐Ni rechargeable alkaline batteries, no explicit electrochemical studies have elucidated how nanostructures, fabricated in the oxidized state, are reduced during the initial formation step, yielding elemental Zn. In this work, a hydrothermal synthesis of freestanding electrodes is proposed, based on vertically aligned ZnO nanorods grown directly on carbon cloth (CC) ( ZnO/CC ). ZnO nanostructuring mitigates passivation, while the carbon cloth fiber network confines soluble Zn(II) intermediates, hindering diffusion into the electrolyte bulk. Moreover, the CC substrate provides optimal electronic contact to the active material, and acts as a built‐in current collector. This work investigates the evolution of ZnO/CC during the first electrochemical reduction cycle, with emphasis on morphochemical nanostructure changes rather than establishing a benchmark anode. Electrochemical measurements are combined with advanced characterization techniques, high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X‐ray absorption hyperspectral imaging via scanning transmission X‐ray microscopy (STXM) and ptychography at the Zn L‐edge. This multimodal approach offers unprecedented insights into the ZnO‐to‐Zn reduction to guide future Zn‐ion anode design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The increasing use of e‐textiles in healthcare, sports, and fashion has coined a new frontier of scientific innovation. However, unique compositions and embedded electronic elements of these e‐textiles pose significant challenges for end‐of‐life management, markedly in recycling and sustainable design. This review explores the landscape of recycling and sustainable design in e‐textiles, underlining the need for innovative approaches to mitigate ecological and economic impacts. By employing a systematic approach, the paper seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of smart textiles, recycling technologies, and shortcomings, identify the challenges, and propose future directions for sustainable smart textile waste management. Starting with an overview of smart textiles and their growing applications, the paper highlights the importance of recycling in the textile industry to address escalating e‐waste concerns. It evaluates the consequences of smart textile waste, underscoring the urgency of efficient recycling systems. Current recycling technologies are highlighted, alongside their limitations and challenges associated with material composition, inadequate separation techniques, and quality degradation. Emerging recycling technologies, such as advanced de‐embedding and separation techniques and innovative recycling processes, are presented as promising solutions to overcome traditional difficulties. The concept of sustainability in the design of smart textiles is explored, focusing on strategies to enhance recyclability and reduce environmental footprints. Additionally, the paper identifies the key challenges and barriers to recycling smart textiles, such as technological, economic, and regulatory hurdles, and proposes opportunities and future directions to foster a circular economy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a novel method for synthesizing CoO x /Ti 3 AlC 2 composite catalysts using MAX‐phase Ti 3 AlC 2 without etching the Al layer. By employing simple alkali precipitation and high‐temperature calcination, the resulting CoO x /Ti 3 AlC 2 catalyst demonstrated superior performance in the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) degradation of ornidazole (ONZ) compared with CoO x /Ti 3 C 2 (MXene). The CoO x /Ti 3 AlC 2 ‐0.05+PMS catalyst achieved complete ONZ degradation (30 mg L −1 ) within 30 min, significantly outperforming CoO x /MXene‐0.05+PMS, which only achieved 91% removal. The degradation rate constant (Kobs) for CoO x /Ti 3 AlC 2 ‐0.05+PMS (0.19325 min −1 ) is nearly twice that of CoO x /MXene‐0.05+PMS (0.08412 min −1 ), highlighting the crucial role of the Al layer in catalyst activation. Characterization revealed a uniform CoO x nanoparticle dispersion on Ti 3 AlC 2 , and the CoO x /MXene‐0.05 system demonstrated high stability and adaptability in natural water with minimal Co ion leaching. Additionally, radical scavenging and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy elucidated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation mechanisms and identified 11 ONZ degradation intermediates, suggesting potential degradation pathways. This approach eliminated Al etching and offered a cost‐effective and environmentally friendly method for catalyst synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Electrospun fibrous membranes are widely used for water‐oil separation. However, achieving effective separation often requires post‐processing to enhance membrane wettability or modify pore size, which can reduce productivity. In this study, a simple method is proposed for pore size control via mechanical compression of electrospun membranes. Polystyrene (PS) fibrous membranes (PFMs) are fabricated through electrospinning and subsequently compressed using a hand tool, reducing the membrane thickness by ≈87%. The proportion of pores smaller than 10 µm in diameter increase from 4.8% before compression to a maximum of 45.6% after compression. While the uncompressed membrane allowes sub‐10‐µm water droplets to pass through, the compressed membrane effectively blocked them. Due to the oleophilic nature of PS, oil permeation occurres rapidly via capillary action, while water droplets are retained within the membrane's internal pores, facilitating continuous demulsification. By combining electrospinning with mechanical compression, the optimized compressed PS fibrous membrane (CPFM) successfully separated water‐in‐oil emulsions under gravity, achieving a separation flux of 606 L m −2 h −1 with an oil purity of over 99.85%. This approach provides a simple, cost‐effective, and highly efficient method for water‐in‐oil emulsion separation.",

The optimized CoNb0.6 catalyst showcases an overpotential of 260 and 250 mV at 10 mA cm − 2 for the OER in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H₂SO₄, respectively, significantly lower than that of Co₃O₄, which requires 440 and 310 mV under the same conditions. Nb doping significantly enhances the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and charge transfer kinetics of CoNb0.6 exhibiting a 7.8‐fold and 10‐fold increase in ECSA in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H₂SO₄, respectively. The catalyst can operates at a current density of 10, 30, and 100 mA cm −2 for over 35 h under 1 M KOH, but it operates for ≈80 h at a current density of 10 and 50 mA cm −2 under 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 . The higher activity emanated from the synergistic effect between the Nb 5+ dopant and Co 3 O 4 . Whereas the long‐term durability emanates from the formation of Nb 5+ in Co 3 O 4 during OER suppresses dissolution of Co and strengthens the Co─O bonds in Co 3 O 4 to prevent the formation of soluble high‐valent Nb species.",

The economical and effective extraction of HMs from polluted soil is in high demand for green and sustainable development prospects. Electrokinetic remediation (EKR) is a viable and environmentally friendly technique to remove HMs from contaminated soil. However, the efficiency of EKR is inadequate due to the limited working efficiency of traditional electrode materials. Recently, it has been revealed that advanced electrode materials (Adv‐EMs), including nanomaterials, porous materials, and polymers in the 2D EKR, 3D EKR, and auxiliary electrode EKR systems, play a critical role in enhancing removal efficiency, and over the past few years, considerable attention has been paid to them. However, no study is available that summarizes the developments in Adv‐EMs in EKR technology. Herein, recent progress and development in designing Adv‐EMs are summarized. Specifically, the fundamental mechanisms during the EKR process, along with peculiar examples of Adv‐EM synthesis designs with enhanced removal efficiency, are reviewed. Compared with the 2D EKR system, the removal efficiency is much improved using 3D and auxiliary electrodes. This review will provide guidelines for designing Adv‐EMs and developing more effective techniques for soil pollution remediation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For green chemical synthesis, designing a metal‐free heterogeneous organocatalyst is very challenging as it offers an environment‐friendly route over conventional metal‐based catalysts. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have huge potential to be explored as heterogeneous organocatalysts because they contain several important features in one system, viz. high specific surface area, metal‐free, desired organic functionalization, and outstanding stability. Herein, a ─SO 3 H group anchored COF is synthesized, TFR‐PDS‐COF by employing a Schiff base extended condensation reaction. The material is highly crystalline in nature, exhibiting moderate BET surface area (115 m 2 g −1 ) and very high NH 3 uptake capacity (1045 µmol g −1 ). The high chemisorption property toward NH 3 suggests the highly acidic nature of the material, which motivate to explore it in the acid‐catalyzed reaction. Initially, the amination of epoxide, which is a classic example of an acid‐catalyzed epoxide activation reaction is chosen. TFR‐PDS‐COF exhibit good catalytic activity toward the amination of epoxides to β‐amino alcohol synthesis for both simple and complex systems at room temperature under solvent‐free conditions. The catalyst exhibits high recyclability for several cycles with the retention of its framework. The catalyst has been employed for other acid catalytic reactions such as cycloaddition and acetalization reactions, and displays excellent conversion with high selectivity. All of these results suggest that TFR‐PDS‐COF is a potential candidate for large‐scale and highly sustainable acid‐catalytic reactions.",

Although there is a growing body of work demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach and investigating the origin of this improved stability, studies to date have primarily focused on branched aminopolymer systems such as branched poly(ethylenimine). In this work, hydroxyl‐functionalized linear poly(ethylenimine) is used to continue to probe the underlying protective mechanism of this strategy. A combination of thermogravimetric analysis, NMR relaxometry, differential scanning calorimetry, and computational simulations is used to better understand the relationship between the extent of chemical functionalization, physical properties, and adsorbent performance.",

It is well known that numerous bio‐based platform chemicals can be obtained from biomass. Among them, 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2,5‐bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (FDCA) – achieved by HMF hydrogenation – are two of the most studied representatives. The etherification of these molecules with different alcohols yields 5‐(alkoxymethyl)furfurals (AMFs) and 2,5‐bis(alkoxymethyl) furans (BAMFs) respectively, both demonstrating potential application as fuel additives. In addition, HMF, when subjected to self‐etherification, leads to 5,5′‐[oxybis(methylene)]bis‐2‐furfural (OBMF), another bio‐based monomer of growing interest. In this work, a comprehensive investigation on the etherification of HMF and 2,‐5‐bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) promoted by a commercially available ion exchange resin – Purolite CT275DR – is conducted using a continuous flow apparatus. The reaction conditions are optimized for the etherification of BHMF with ethanol and then extended to achieve a library of BAMFs. In addition, HMF etherification and self‐etherification are studied. HMF self‐etherification to form OBMF is conducted using dimethyl carbonate in the presence of both heterogeneous and homogeneous acid catalysts. Finally green metrics are calculated for the etherification of BHMF with ethanol and the values are compared to previously published procedures.",

In this work, a Mo doped Ni 3 N/Ni 3 S 2 heterointerface is designed that exhibits superior SOR activity and adequate durability together by combining the advantages of transition metal nitrides and sulphides. The study further revealed that a certain amount of Mo doping is desirable for the resulting Mo@Ni 3 N/Ni 3 S 2 to exhibit optimized catalytic activity well supported by the density funtional theory (DFT) analysis.

This study develops an ingenious supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO 2 )‐engineered dual‐defect strategy, synthesizing defect‐rich PtNi alloy nanocatalysts anchored on carbon supports (PtNi/C). The SC CO 2 treatment introduces defects into both the carbon matrix and PtNi nanoparticles, enhancing metal‐support interactions and optimizing electronic structures. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate exceptional HER performance of the PtNi/C catalysts with an ultralow overpotentials of 17 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and 119 mV at 100 mA cm −2 in alkaline environment, outperforming the 20 wt.% Pt/C. DFT calculations elucidate that carbon and Pt vacancies synergistically lower the energy barriers for water dissociation (Volmer step), while Pt vacancies further promote the hydrogen adsorption (Tafel step), accelerating reaction kinetics. The dual‐defect architecture balances the water dissociation and hydrogen desorption, enabling outstanding HER enhancement. This work highlights SC CO 2 as a powerful tool for defect‐engineering and establishes a structure‐activity framework for advancing high‐performance HER systems.",

This precisely engineered architecture enables the highly efficient cyclopropanation of styrene with ethyl diazoacetate in water using only 0.3 mol% hemin loading, achieving yields up to 94.4% under ambient air. The catalytic system demonstrates robustness and sustainability, retaining over 90% activity after four cycles via a simple extraction‐based recovery.

With varying effects between two cultivations, heat pressing at 100 MPa changes hydrophobicity, increases tensile strength and stiffness, in line with hyphal compaction and bonding. Compared to mycelium grown on glucose‐based medium, lignocellulosic substrate leads to mycelium with higher β ‐glucan content, less densely packed mycelium structure and thus lower mechanical strength, probably due to the different expression of genes involved in glucan and chitin biosynthesis. This study highlights the impact of heat pressing on fungal mycelium obtained from different cultivation conditions, offering insights to tailor their performance.",

In particular, indoor comfort and the control of radiative heat transfer into and out of the building require adaptive and tunable solutions for shading and emissivity. Here, a switchable, ultrathin suspended particle device (SPD) for large‐area integration with smart facades is presented. The system is based on a fluidic window, manufactured at low cost from a laminate of structured, rolled glass and a thin cover with high surface strength. Loading the circulating fluid with magnetic nanoparticles enables active shading and solar‐thermal energy harvesting, whereby the loading state and, hence, the optical properties of the liquid can be controlled through remote switching in a particle collector‐suspender device. In the fully shaded state, a typical harvesting efficiency of 45% of the incoming solar power is obtained. For an average solar irradiance of 1000 W m −2 during 800 h a −1 , this corresponds to a solar thermal harvesting capacity in the range of 360 kWh a −1 m −2 . In comparison to alternative SPD concepts, this enables high flexibility and compatibility with established production lines.

To realize the selective absorption of oil, lots of efforts have been made to change its hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity. Here, several bio‐based main‐chain type benzoxazines with extremely low surface tension are synthesized from a renewable feedstock and loaded on the skeleton of MS through a simple dipping–squeezing–curing process. Consequently, a series of polybenzoxazine‐modified MSs (PB–MSs) are fabricated. With the benzoxazine loading content ranging from 0.13% to 30.4%, the PB–MSs show a high water contact angle (WCA) of 137.8° ± 1.5° to 144.5° ± 1.0° and excellent gravimetric absorption capacity ( Q m/m ) of 117.0 ± 1.59 to 140.64 ± 0.68 g g −1 when chloroform is used as the oil phase. After 15 absorbing–squeezing cycles, the 67.47% to 76.29% retentive absorption capacity is observed. Notably, the excellent absorption selectivity is reflected by the trace amount of water (ppm grade) in the separated oil phase. The bio‐based benzoxazine shows great potential to functionalize MSs for effective oil/water separation and the application of bio‐based materials in the field of environmental pollution treatment is demonstrated.",

The as‐prepared AC macrospheres after potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation are found to possess extraordinarily developed microporosity of which 87% is ultra‐microporosity with pore diameters less than 0.8 nm. Despite the relatively low surface area of just 714 m 2 g −1 with a pore volume of 0.285 cm 3 g −1 , the macrospherical carbon adsorbents achieve exceedingly high CO 2 uptake capacities of 3.15 and 1.86 mmol g −1 at 0 and 25 °C, respectively, with a CO 2 partial pressure of 0.15 bar. Cyclic lifetime performance testing demonstrates that the CO 2 uptake is fully reversible with fast adsorption and desorption kinetics. More importantly, due to their high bulk density of ≈1.0 g cm −3 , the AC macrospheres exhibit extremely high volumetric CO 2 uptakes of up to 81.8 g L −1 at 25 °C at 0.15 bar CO 2 , which represents the highest value ever reported for ACs. The high ultra‐microporosity coupled with the potassium‐modified physiochemical surface properties is found to be responsible for the outstanding CO 2 adsorption performance of the pitch‐based AC macrospheres.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a grand challenge for energy storage technologies. Several perovskites and other oxides of earth‐abundant elements are found to exhibit improved catalytic OER activity. However, less attention is paid to the electrochemical stability, an important factor for large‐scale application. The ongoing search for stable catalysts calls for characterizing active catalyst surfaces and identifying mechanisms of deactivation, activation, or repair. In situ techniques are indispensable for these tasks. This study uses environmental transmission electron microscopy on the highly correlated perovskite Pr 1– x Ca x MnO 3 and the Ruddlesden–Popper Pr 0.5 Ca 1.5 MnO 4 as model electrodes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the stability trends identified on rotating ring disk electrodes. An electron beam at fluxes well below those that would cause radiation damage is used to induce positive local electrode potentials due to secondary electron emission, driving electrochemical reactions in H 2 O vapor. The stability of the model systems increases with increasing ionic character of the MnO bond, while more covalent bonds are prone to corrosion, which is triggered by formation of point defects in the oxygen sublattice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water remediation at minimal cost is the need of the day, as freshwater aquifers are declining at an alarming rate. To address this challenge, composite membranes is herein developed using a unique reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)‐synthesized copolymer as the active surface layer, a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane serving as the support layer, and foamy molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets decorated with dithi‐magnetospheres acting as the interlayer. This strategy is adopted because the commercial RO membrane is effective toward desalination but is susceptible to fouling and biofilm. The foamy interlayer MoS 2 nanosheets decorated with dithi‐magnetospheres in the composite membranes minimize the additional resistance, both in terms of flow and also facilitate reversible action toward heavy metal removal. Further, the composite membranes exhibit a 7‐log reduction in bacterial colonies for both gram‐positive and gram‐negative strains. A stringent and targeted action is also observed in terms of intracellular reactive oxygen species generation. In addition, excellent reversible antifouling with 98.5% flux retention ratio is observed. The average lead (II) removal at 50 ppm is 95.3% and the average arsenic (III) removal at 50 ppm is observed to be 96%. Thus, these membranes could be the next generation to advance sustainable systems for water remediation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are regarded as one of the most promising electrochemical technologies for grid‐connected renewable energy storage systems. The performance of VRFBs, however, strongly depends on the membrane, one of the key components of VRFBs with critical dual functions of promotion of diffusion of active species (H + , H 3 O + , SO 4 2− , or SO 4 H − ) and inhibition of crossover of vanadium ions. This is intrinsically related to the microstructure of membranes. For example, large and connected ionic clusters or pores in membranes are favorable for the ion transfer, but detrimental to the ion selectivity. While small and isolated hydrophilic ion clusters or pores suppress the water uptake and ion transfer, the decreased swelling ratio would enhance chemical stability of membrane. Thus, comprehensive strategies are required to realize the optimal balance between the ion selectivity, proton conductivity, and chemical stability. This review focuses on the effects of microstructure of membranes on the ion transfer and the chemical stability, including introduction of the rigid groups, electron‐withdrawing groups, and hydrophobic backbones, are reviewed. The prospect of the development of membranes with high ion selectivity and high‐performance VRFBs is discussed.",

Oak‐derived hard carbon (HC) is revealed to have a nanographite domain structure, showing conductivity as high as that of artificial graphite. The CO 2 ‐activated hard carbon (A–HC) has a conductivity one order higher than that of commercial activated carbon, with a surface area of 1126 m 2 g −1 . The energy densities of supercapacitors composed of a tetrachlorohydroquinone cathode and anthraquinone (AQ) or 1,5‐dichloroanthraquinone (DCAQ) anode are 19.0 and 13.8 Wh kg −1 , respectively. The utilization rate of AQ with A–HC is 97.6% (250.9 mAh g −1 ), which is much higher than those in previous reports (≈80%). After 1000 cycles, 91.0% of the discharge capacity is retained when the DCAQ anode is used. Biorefined wood materials lead to a remarkable improvement in the operation of organic supercapacitors. This is intriguing, because the functional carbon material herein is easily prepared from a natural resource, wood, whereas numerous studies have prepared such materials from artificial chemical sources. Therefore, the use of oak‐derived HC enhances the usability of organic active materials for energy storage devices and potentially has a far‐reaching impact on the environment.",

The orange peel is combined with silk fibroin in order to obtain alcogels, which are successfully converted into highly porous biocomposite foams upon supercritical CO 2 drying. The biocomposite shows a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area of 174.45 m 2 g −1 and can absorb three times its weight in water. The resulting adsorbents can adsorb methylene blue from water with a maximum adsorption capacity of 113.8 ± 12.5 mg g −1 , with the orange peel activity well preserved in the polymeric matrix. The spectroscopic studies performed show that the methylene blue molecules are adsorbed in the form of monomers on the surface of the biocomposite foams, forming a monolayer as suggested by the Langmuir isotherm model. Although the agrowaste powders are already confirmed to be promising biosorbents for the removal of pollutants from water, the difficulties caused by their recovery after the water treatment may limit their manageability and applicability. With this study, such limitations can be overcome thanks to the incorporation of the powder in a solid porous system, without significantly compromising the dye adsorption capacity of the incorporated orange peel.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Production of bioplastics from renewable biological resources is a prerequisite for the development of a circular and sustainable society. Current bioplastics are mostly heat‐sensitive aliphatic polymers, requiring thermoresistant aromatic bioplastics. Herein, 3‐amino‐4‐hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) and 4‐aminobenzoic acid (ABA) are produced from kraft pulp, an inedible cellulosic feedstock, using metabolically engineered bacteria. AHBA is chemically converted to 3,4‐diaminobenzoic acid (DABA); subsequently, poly(2,5‐benzimidazole) is obtained by the polycondensation of DABA and processed into an ultrahigh thermoresistant film. The copolymerization of DABA with a small amount of ABA dramatically increases the degradation temperatures of the resulting films (over 740 °C) to yield the most thermoresistant plastic on record. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the incorporation of ABA strengthens the interchain hydrogen bonds between aromatic imidazole rings. Thus, an alternative organic molecular design is proposed for thermoresistant plastics without using heavy inorganics, although continuous aromatic heterocycles are widely considered ideal for polymer thermoresistance. This innovative macromolecular design increases thermoresistance and can be widely applied to well‐processable plastics for the production of lightweight materials and is expected to contribute to the development of a more sustainable society.",

In this study, bifunctional catalysts (V 2 O 5 , ZrO 2 , Cr 2 O 3 , and Ga 2 O 3 doped H‐ZSM‐5) are synthesized through additive manufacturing for CO 2 ‐ODHP. Characterization and correlation between the various characterizations and the catalytic results indicates that the direct 3D printing of metal oxides alongside H‐ZSM‐5 can considerably modify the surface properties and bulk oxide phase dispersion, thus leading to enhanced metal oxide reducibility and exceptional CO 2 ‐ODHP performance. Among the metal monoliths, the mixed oxide sample with 5 wt% Cr, 10 wt% V, 10 wt% Zr, 10 wt% Ga and 65 wt% H‐ZSM‐5 displays the best activity, achieving ≈40% propane conversion, 95% propylene selectivity, and zero benzene/toluene/xylene production. Upon eliminating CO 2 , the catalyst monoliths all retain their long‐term stability; however, the propane conversions decrease by ≈3% and the propylene selectivities decreased by 5–15%. Nevertheless, all five samples examined here demonstrate exceptional catalytic activities and prolonged stabilities, which are attributed to the even distribution of surface acid sites produced by direct printing of the oxide and zeolite components. Overall, this study presents a novel way of manufacturing bifunctional structured catalysts that exhibit exceptional ODHP performance.",

The cultivation of perennial wild plant mixtures (WPM) addresses many of these problems. Despite being less developed than maize, WPM cultivation has received notable attention among scientists in Germany over the past decade. This is mainly because WPMs clearly outperform maize in social–ecological measures, despite their methane yield performance. This review summarizes and discusses the results of 12 years of research and practice with WPMs as a social‐ecologically more benign bioenergy cropping system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Graphene‐based hydrogels are known as promising amphiphilic agents for water uptake and selective organic contaminant removal. However, it is a challenge to prevent graphene sheet restacking during the gelation as this factor significantly influences the adsorption behavior of organic contaminant. A porous reduced graphene oxide‐starch hydrogel (rGOSH) with enhanced pore size is produced by a simple one‐step method through starch‐directed self‐assembly of graphene sheets. This hydrogel demonstrated to be a promising candidate for the selective removal of organic dye molecules, where positive and neutral dyes are adsorbed, and the negative one is repelled. In particular, the hydrogel prepared with incorporation of starch between the graphene sheets, adsorbs positively charged dye ≈75% more than reduced graphene oxide hydrogel, due to better diffusion into larger pore size and strong electrostatic interaction with negatively charged oxygen groups. Furthermore, the Langmuir isotherm model and kinetic studies for dyes adsorption onto rGOSH reveal that the adsorption mechanisms are dominantly chemisorption within the porous hydrogel structure since the experimental data can be well fitted to the pseudo‐second‐order dynamic equation with the highest adsorption capacity (1106.950 µg g −1 ) and kinetic (1.957E‐05 g µg −1 min −0.5 ) toward the positively charged dye.",

Such conventional coating methods require several steps, which is time‐, chemical‐, and energy‐consuming. Also, polymeric binders can impair the porosity and block catalytic sites of final electrodes. This study introduces a novel one‐pot synthesis method in which Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles are entrapped within a multi‐walled carbon nanotube network, the latter being templated with microtubular geometry. Such carbon microtubes (CMT) represent a standalone geometry, serving as a binder‐free electrode for an energy‐efficient heterogeneous electro‐Fenton (HEF) process. Fe 3 O 4 ‐containing CMTs remove carbamazepine (CBZ), a frequently detected pharmaceutical micropollutant in water bodies. While almost all literature reports degradation at acidic conditions requiring the use of acid, this material system functions at pH 7 ± 0.3 with lengthy reusability. The remarkable mineralization of the total oxidized CBZ emerges from the confinement of oxidation by‐products in CMTs’ 3D framework, where unselective radicals are formed once the electro‐generated H 2 O 2 reacts with embedded Fe 3 O 4 . Additionally, the 3D network prevents the entrapped catalysts from leaching in acidic environments because of the increased local pH during electrolysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) announced by United Nations guarantees access to clean, affordable, and inexhaustible resources for all present and future human societies. Access to water and energy have always been two pillars of the SDGs. The use of renewable energy and nexus planning is among the essential strategies to achieve sustainable energy and water development while minimizing carbon emissions. Accordingly, this paper aims at proposing a method to access energy and water in line with SDGs targets, i.e., considering their linkage with carbon emission. This objective is addressed by proposing a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for a local community's water and energy resource planning based on energy–water–carbon nexus. To this end, initially, the relationship between the energy supply system, drinking water, and carbon pollution is modeled for a local community. Hybrid renewable energies and desalination are considered as the primary energy and water resources, respectively. The optimal size of the nexus components is then determined by considering the community demand with the minimum system cost and maintaining the permissible pollution. The simulations demonstrate nexus planning's superiority to achieve a more sustainable community in terms of affordability and pollution when supplying energy and water.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bifunctional oxygen reduction/oxidation reaction (ORR/OER) electrocatalysts derived from biomass are one of the most valuable materials in terms of sustainability, ecological economy and industrial manufacturing, and are emerging as a desired alternative to the commercial Pt/C and IrO 2 catalysts. This work demonstrates the processing of agricultural cornstalk waste of cornstalks into stable bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts with high‐performance by a simple and cost‐effective strategy. Rich hydrophilic active groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) in the hierarchical porous structures of the native cornstalks enable the sufficient facile combination with transition metals (e.g., Co, Fe, Zn) and heteroatoms (e.g., B, N) from soluble Co(NO 3 ) 2 , ZnCl 2 , H 3 BO 3 , NH 4 Cl in a hydrothermal reaction. The pyrolytic evaporation of Zn 2+ in a high‐temperature carbonization process facilitates the generation of abundant micropores and mesopores to increase specific surface areas (941.44 m 2 g −1 ) and also hinders aggregation between neighboring transition metals. The synergistic effects of N, B, Fe and Co doping in hierarchical porous biochar‐structures contributes to outstanding bifunctional ORR/OER activities and working stabilities, outperforming commercial Pt/C and IrO 2 catalysts. Computational results further verify the valuable synergistic contributions based on density‐functional theory (DFT). This approach opens up a new possibility for the fabrication of bifunctional biochar‐based ORR/OER catalysts from artificial engineering and green processing for sustainable agricultural wastes.",

Although BC membranes exhibit excellent mechanical properties and industrial scalability, they are semitransparent, which limits their performance. To improve the optical properties of BC membranes, methods such as the polymerization of different inorganic–organic hybrid materials and petrochemical derivative monomers have been considered; however, these methods require considerable time and effort. In this work, transparent BC membranes for conformable OLEDs substrates are fabricated by spray coating a solution of recycled petrochemical plastics, found in expanded foam package wastes, and d‐limonene, which is a green solvent extracted from orange peels. This fabrication approach is highly scalable and can be considered a sustainable technique to develop high performance transparent substrates for photonic applications based on both recovered petrochemical polymers and naturally occurring biopolymers. In terms of the morphological and structural properties, the resulting transparent membranes exhibit a lower roughness than pristine BC. The resulting BC‐PS composite is used as a substrate for OLED fabrication. The conformable OLEDs exhibit a current efficiency of up to 5 cd A −1 (16 000 cd m −2 ) and power density of ≈2.8 mW cm −2 .",

A two‐year two‐factorial field experiment was conducted in 2015 and 2016 to investigate intercropping of black cumin and fenugreek in five ratios and biofertilizer application as AMF and bacteria. Intercropping reveals higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compared with monocropping, whereas monocropping inoculated with bacteria shows the highest seed yield of both fenugreek (151 g m −2 ) and black cumin (148 g m −2 ). Regarding the quality of black cumin, the combination of a black cumin:fenugreek‐intercropping pattern of 66:34 with bacteria fertilization is most promising, as it shows i) the maximum essential oil content, oil yield, and fixed oil content, ii) the highest contents of thymol and p ‐cymene, iii) the highest content of linoleic acid, and iv) the maximum land equivalent ratio. Conclusively, bacteria fertilization and black cumin:fenugreek‐intercropping pattern of 66:34 helps improving essential oil, fixed oil quality, and quantity of black cumin, thus creating a more sustainable cultivation system for black cumin and fenugreek.",

Exploiting the unique features of natural materials through biomimicry offers an exciting research field with large potential for new discoveries. Wood, as one of the most fascinating biomaterials, combines unique mechanical properties, an anisotropic hierarchical porosity optimized to provide rapid, and low tortuosity pathways for nutrient/water transport, abundance, and biodegradability. Accordingly, wood has inspired scientists to mimic its outstanding properties in artificial analogues to develop batteries with remarkable electrochemical performance. For instance, its sophisticated structure can be transferred to solid‐state materials through biomimetic templating to increase the lifespan and energy density of batteries, while its inherent hierarchical multi‐channeled structure allows the synthesis of current collectors with enhanced ion and electron diffusivity. This Review highlights the recent progress into the application of wood as a hierarchically porous and renewable material to develop different battery components, including the cathode, the anode, the separator, and current collectors. The potential of wood‐inspired batteries to lessen the pressure over critical raw materials and additional environmental sustainability benefits are highlighted within a circular economy perspective.",

Here, amyloid hybrid aerogels are introduced for universal and renewable freshwater production by relying on the combination of sustainable materials and solar energy, thus making the process highly ecological and virtually costless. Amyloid fibrils obtained from whey, a byproduct of the dairy industry, are used as the main scaffold for the aerogels, whose solar energy harvesting properties of the top surface are enhanced by bioinspired dark polymers, such as polydopamine. Due to the fast water transport throughout the porous aerogels, the high‐yielding photothermal conversion ability of the top surface, and efficient heat insulation at the bottom, the hybrid amyloid fibrils aerogel exhibits a water evaporation rate of 1.61 kg·m −2 h −1 with a solar‐thermal conversion efficiency as high as 91.3% under 1 sun illumination. The process allows desalinating various seawater sources with different salinities to levels below the drinking water threshold recommended by the World Health Organization. Moreover, the same hybrid amyloid evaporator is highly efficient in removing heavy metals, organic pollutants, bacteria, and viruses from water, introducing a general, sustainable and energy‐efficient solution for desalination and water purification.",

To date, CNTs have had limited use due to their high synthesis cost. The synthesis costs decrease when CNTs are prepared by transition metal nucleated molten electrolytic CO 2 splitting, rather than by conventional chemical vapor deposition or arc deposition techniques. In addition to cost, a second advantage of CNT electrosynthesis is that the process consumes the greenhouse gas CO 2 in its transformation to CNTs (and oxygen), providing a path to climate mitigation. However, electrolytic high yield, CNT syntheses has only been demonstrated with expensive lithiated electrolytes, such as pure or mixed Li 2 CO 3 . This study demonstrates, after several hundred failures, that carbon nanomaterials, can be synthesized from CO 2 in non‐lithiated electrolytes. In the new sodium barium carbonate electrolytes, lower mobility due to the absence of lithium ions is overcome by: i) low current density; or ii) the introduction of oxides, such as BaO, to induce graphene walls to facilitate passage of larger cations during the process of growing CNTs; and/or iii) addition of specific transition metal nucleation agents, such as Fe 2 O 3 . The electrolysis uses inexpensive anodes and cathodes to form carbon nanomaterials, including straight and coiled CNTs.",

It has high selectivity and can be employed to extract heat sensitive, easily oxidized compounds with high efficiency. Less organic solvent is used during extraction, leaving no toxic residues in the product. With these advantages, SFE has been widely applied in bioactive compound extraction from natural plant materials or by‐products. This review summarizes the recent application of SFE in nutraceutical industries including recovery of carotenoids, phenolic compounds, lipids, flavor and fragrance, and decaffeination of tea and coffee. The key parameters affecting SFE are also discussed with focuses on pretreatment, temperature and pressure, flow rate, extraction time, and cosolvent/modifier. Overall, this review builds a comprehensive picture of SFE application in the nutraceutical industry.

The methods of powering these sensors have attracted extensive attention, of which harvesting the breeze energy abundant in farmland is a good way. Herein, the triboelectric nanogenerator with blade‐enclosed structure (BE‐TENG) is proposed to enhance the durability and robustness. The device achieves a low start‐up wind speed of 1.5 m/s due to the structure based on the horizontal axis wind wheel and can output an open‐circuit voltage of 360 V. Importantly, after 10 hours of continuous operation, the voltage signal of the BE‐TENG has almost no attenuation, and its output performance can maintain stability even in a high humidity environment of 90%, showing strong durability and robustness. Experiments show that under breeze conditions, the BE‐TENG can drive almost 600 light‐emitting diodes and successfully power a soil temperature sensor. In addition, it can drive a hygrothermograph in a simulated rainfall environment, realizing the monitoring of ambient temperature and humidity.

Ag‐based catalysts with high‐curvature nanoneedle structure exhibit the potential to achieve high CO 2 RR activity, but suffer from insufficient stability due to the vulnerability of the high‐curvature structure during CO 2 RR. Herein, the uniform porous Zn conformal coating on high‐curvature dendritic Ag nanoneedles (AgNNs@Zn) by vacuum thermal evaporation is prepared. As the surface sacrificial shell, the dissolution and reconstruction of Zn protect the inner Ag core, thus enhancing the CO 2 RR stability of AgNNs@Zn. The concentration of Ag + in the electrolyte after 2 h CO 2 RR electrolysis markedly reduces from 2.4 ug L −1 in AgNNs to 1.4 ug L −1 in AgNNs@Zn. Moreover, the DFT calculation reveals that the constructed Ag–Zn interfaces can stabilize the *COOH intermediates, which promote the selectivity of CO 2 reduction into CO. As a result, the optimized AgNNs@Zn catalyst exhibits the FE CO of ≈91% at −0.86 V versus RHE in H‐cell, and FE CO of 90% at 100 mA cm −2 above 12 h in flow cell.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing numerous superior properties, are integrated into various components of LSBs for performance improvement. Nevertheless, a systematic and insightful issue‐based study of their inherent roles in addressing the practical challenges of LSBs is lacking. There is a growing consensus that CNTs do not directly contribute to the specific capacity (i.e., being involved in the redox reactions with electron loss/gain), while their auxiliary roles, such as providing a conductive and mechanically reinforced framework for active materials, are of prime significance in regulating the electrochemical reaction, charge transport, and mass transfer in the system.

The best photocatalytic activity of Bi 0.95 Ag 0.05 Fe 0.95 Mn 0.05 O 3 ‐GO (ABMGO) nanocomposite is attributed to its large intrinsic local ferroelectric polarization, which suppresses the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers and the presence of Ag + and Mn 4+ as new active sites on the large surface of ABMGO speeds up the photodegradation of DBP.

    "abstract": "Abstract Persistent free radicals (PFR) in carbonized particles may play a role in degradation of environmental compounds. The influence of PFR is evaluated in various carbonized particles on their radical scavenging efficiency upon the common radical indicator 2‐2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Carbonized particles are derived by hydrothermal carbonization of glucose (C‐W) or glucose and urea (NC‐W) and ionothermal carbonization of glucose and urea ionic liquid (IL) (NC‐IL). The carbonized materials contain OH/COOH, C=C, and C‐O functionalities. The addition of urea introduces NH/NH 2 functionalities. The content of polar surface groups is lower in IL‐processed NC‐IL. The scavenging ability, measured as DPPH UV–vis absorption decline, increases with concentration and time for all particles, while the efficiency changes are in the order of C‐W &gt; NC‐W &gt; NC‐IL. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis reveals similar radical concentration in all carbonized materials studied. The difference in efficiency is, thus, not directly related to the PFR concentration but rather to the type of PFR, surface functionalities and/or scavenging mechanism. According to the g‐values, radicals in these particles are carbon‐centered. The minor variation in g‐values suggests interactions between the radicals and their environmental functional groups. This provides insights into the influence of PFR in carbonized materials on their radical scavenging efficiency.",

Great efforts are devoted to improving the safety and cyclability of such new‐type batteries, and certain progress is successfully achieved. However, given the diversity of application scenarios, the practical applications of Li metal batteries still remain challenges, especially in extremely low temperatures. The drop in temperature largely reduces the capacity and lifespan of batteries due to sluggish Li‐ion (Li + ) transportation and uncontrollable Li plating behaviors. Recently, attention is gradually paid to Li metal batteries for low‐temperature operation, where the explorations on high‐performance low‐temperature electrolytes emerge as a hot topic. In this review, the progress of low‐temperature Li metal batteries is systematically summarized. The challenges and influences of low temperatures on Li metal batteries are concluded. Subsequently, the solutions to low‐temperature Li metal batteries based on electrolyte engineering are reviewed and discussed. Additionally, the techniques for low‐temperature characterizations are classified and discussed. Most importantly, the future development prospects of low‐temperature Li metal batteries are proposed from sustainable perspectives.",

Filters comprising silk proteins show a much lower demand on fine‐dust‐layer material (40–210 mg m −2 ) in comparison to that of conventional filters (50 g m −2 ). Filters equipped with silk meshes with fiber diameters in the sub‐micrometer regime (&lt;250 nm) show improved filter qualities in comparison to that of commercially available air filter devices (with melt blown fibers in the &gt;20 µm regime). In particular, sub‐micrometer particles (0.2–1 µm) are filtered more efficiently by the silk‐based filters due to interception and impaction effects yielding a low pressure drop, and therefore these filters show an improved air permeability and lowered pressure drop of, for example, a vacuum cleaner bag in which they can be employed.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a new strategy for the utilization of cocoa shell waste, a by‐product of cocoa industry, is presented for the development of new bioelastomers. The cocoa shell waste (CSW) is first micronized and then incorporated into single component acetoxy‐poly(dimethylsiloxane) (acetoxy‐PDMS) macromolecular matrix by a mixing process to produce bioelastomer composites with tunable properties. A detailed study is carried out to investigate the influence of micronized cocoa waste concentration on the curing process and on the properties of final materials. It is found that addition of CSWs has a strong effect on the curing behavior of PDMS due to establishment of an intermolecular hydrogen bond network between the two components. CSW bioelastomers are hydrophobic and exhibit good water barrier properties. In addition, the bioelastomers show effective antioxidant scavenging activity against 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH•) and 2,2′‐azinobis(3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS •+ ). The incorporation of micronized CSW into PDMS is also found to significantly enhance the Young's modulus of the elastomers. Hence, these antioxidant bioelastomers originating from food industry waste can be highly suitable as materials for active food packaging applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Li‐ion batteries need to be regularly recharged, requiring chargers and connection to the grid to reverse the lithium‐ion transfer. Autonomous power sources independent of the electrical infrastructure are desired. A strategy to develop continuously functioning Li‐ion batteries is focused on a new architecture of electrodes which are capable of both harvesting light energy and storing it. One possible way to achieve this lies in a study aimed at evaluating whether lithium ions can display mobility inside a crystal structure upon light absorption, as in analogy to the dissociation process of excitons. Herein, it is demonstrated that by using Li x TiO 2 nanoparticles, bandgap excitation can induce a quantitative Li‐ion deinsertion reaction by the free holes generated. The half‐electrochemical cells containing these mesoporous lithiated TiO 2 can be fully oxidized in only 1 h of light exposure. It displays close to 3 V open‐circuit potential under light and electrical load, and, provides a constant output power under fluctuating light conditions. Such an approach has the potential, when integrated into a fully regenerative device containing a suitable counter electrode, to generate energy during both day and night, thus having the potential to close the gap between electrochemical energy storage batteries and energy conversion photovoltaics.",

To maximize its photocatalytic efficiency by enhancing the photogenerated charge separation, lowering the intrinsically large bandgap (3.2 eV) of TiO 2 is a key problem to be overcome. Herein, a new design is reported for an efficient photocatalyst realized by heterostructuring a 3D nanostructured TiO 2 monolith (3D TiO 2 ) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) through using 3‐aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) as a linker. The incorporation of APTES between the TiO 2 /GQD interface enables the formation of a charge injection‐type heterostructure, as confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy, providing improvement of both visible absorption and charge separation. As a result, the heterostructure exhibits a 242% enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to that of nonheterostructured 3D TiO 2 under visible irradiation, demonstrating its promising potential for practical photocatalytic applications in environmental remediation.",

The good transparency, flatness, and resistance of as‐cast substrates allow the successful preparation of organic solar cells. Photovoltaic performances similar to those reported for other natural/biobased supports are achieved, confirming the potential of keratin film as an alternative and promising support material for eco‐friendly, fully printable, sustainable, and inexpensive optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar‐driven interfacial water evaporation is a promising strategy to produce clean water by effectively converting abundant solar energy into localized heat. However, many previously reported interfacial evaporation systems are separate and costly. In this work, an all‐in‐one interfacial water evaporator with flexibility, low‐cost, and large‐scale production based on electrostatic flocking technology is proposed. Hydrophilic microfibers (flocks) are vertically planted on the upper side of the textile substrate to enhance the light trapping for photothermal conversion and lower the latent heat for more efficient evaporation. On the other side of the textile, a highly dense and vertically aligned array of hydrophobic flocks are prepared to form a continuous air layer, reducing heat conduction from absorber to bulk water. Taking advantage of those features, the all‐in‐one evaporator achieves a good evaporation rate of 1.32 kg m −2 h −1 for pure water and 1.10 kg m −2 h −1 for seawater. Simultaneously, the evaporator demonstrates resistance to salt accumulation, resulting in its stability in brine. This all‐in‐one evaporator represents an innovative way for designing interfacial evaporators and a convenient approach to mitigate the global freshwater scarcity.",

It uses a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA), according to two functional units, delivery of 50 MJ of electrical energy and kg of battery, to expand the system boundary. The results of the process LCA indicate that the environmental impact of LiBs is lower than SSBs across most environmental impact categories. Conversely, the input–output upstream global warming potential (GWP) of the LiBs, calculated by hybrid LCA, is higher than that of the SSBs. Sensitivity analysis shows that the SSB cycle life must increase from 100 to 2800 to achieve a GWP impact lower than that of LiBs and therefore outperform LiBs in this environmental impact category. The study, therefore, demonstrates that research into SSBs must be accelerated to achieve a functional and safe battery technology with a reduced impact on the environment.",

The coated fabric has an oil contact angle of ≈146° for hexadecane and &gt;150° for many other oils including cooking oil and engine oil. A water drop can completely spread on the fabric within 68 ms. As a result, oil drops on the fabric surface can be easily lifted off by immersion in water. Because of its selective wettability to water, the coated fabric can also be used for oil–water filtration or water absorption from bulk oil. It is further demonstrated that the coated fabric has good hygroscopic and antistatic properties. Fabrics with these functions may find applications including oil–water separation and especially functional clothing for which the oil repellency and easy oil removal are essential while the water repellency is less important. Antistatic properties as shown by this material, are also demanded, in areas such as work clothing for auto repair and oil industries.",

This represents an increase in swelling by over 10 times compared to the already highly absorbing gluten reference material. The carboxylation (using EDTAD) and the cross‐linking of the protein result in a hydrogel with liquid retention capacity as high as 80% of the absorbed water remaining in the WG network on extensive centrifugation, which is higher than that of commercial fossil‐based superabsorbents. The results also show that more polar forms of the reacted genipin are more effectively grafted onto the protein, contributing to the swelling and liquid retention. Microscopy of the materials reveals extensive nanoporosity (300 nm), contributing to rapid capillarity‐driven absorption.

Silk fibroin (SF) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have independently demonstrated their ability to produce high‐quality photonic materials, in part due to their low absorbance and their transparency in the visible range. While SF is able to replicate inverse structures by high‐resolution nano‐templating, CNCs can spontaneously assemble into cholesteric liquid crystalline structures that are retained upon solvent evaporation, yielding photonic films. In this work, the conditions of successful co‐assembly of regenerated SF, extracted from silkworm silk, with CNCs extracted from cotton, are investigated. Their co‐assembly is investigated for various relative concentration ratios and pH, combining polarized optical microscopy and spectroscopy, SEM, and other characterization techniques (XRD, ATR‐FTIR, TGA). The appearance of photonic properties is observed when CNC and SF are assembled at pH ≥ 4.15, highlighting the importance of suppressing attractive electrostatic interactions between the two species for an organized structure to emerge. Beyond its fundamental motivations for colloidal co‐assembly with structural proteins, this work is relevant to design sustainable optical materials compatible with food packaging coatings and edible coloring pigments.",

An acid catalyzed ring opening reaction (6 m aq. H 2 SO 4 , 90 °C) is first used to convert the major bicyclic monoterpenes (α‐pinene, β‐pinene, and 3‐carene) in untreated CST (or GT with 5 mol% Me 2 S) into mixtures of monocyclic p ‐MeDs. These unpurified sulfurous p ‐MeD mixtures (α‐terpinene, γ‐terpinene, and isoterpinolene) are then used as feedstocks for oxidative aromatization (OA), ozonolysis, Diels–Alder, and hydrogenation reactions to produce p ‐cymene, fragrances, anti‐oxidants, drugs, biopolymers, and biofuels. Mechanistic studies of the OA reaction used to convert the p ‐MeDs into p ‐cymene reveal that p ‐cymene hydroperoxide acts as an initiator to produce polar radical intermediates that are stabilized by DMSO generated in situ through aerobic oxidation of Me 2 S. This enables CST and GT to be converted into biorenewable p ‐cymene in 50–60% yields (two steps) using a process that only requires aqueous acid, oxygen, heat, and a final distillation step.",

The indicators of accessibility per capita park area, Gini coefficient, and accessible park share are adopted to assess the urban park inequality in Chongqing and examine park scale impacts, through 21 incremental scenarios. Whilst the overall urban park equity is relatively reasonable in Chongqing's core area, the park accessibility is markedly unequal in distribution. There is no significant difference between the age‐ and income‐vulnerable groups and all residents in urban park equity. However, a highly unequal distribution of comprehensive parks, neighborhood parks, and small pleasance for all residents and vulnerable groups is observed. Moreover, urban park equity can be affected by park scale, where urban park number has a positive impact on accessible per capita park area and a negative effect on Gini coefficient, among all residents and vulnerable groups. There is no significant relationship between park number and the proportion of accessible park share of vulnerable groups. Overall, the impact of park scale is revealed on park‐related equity and policy makers and planners are suggested for public health, environmental equity in urban communities.",

Although replacing conventional plastic products with sustainable alternatives is still a challenge, promising advances have been reported. In this work, the fabrication of responsive bio‐composite films from polycaprolactone (PCL) and magnesium carbonate (MgCO 3 ), known as food additive E504 with melt impregnation into cellulose, is reported. Cellulose fibers are stained/coated with ethanoic curcumin solutions, primarily to protect them against oxidative degradation. The films demonstrate a strong antioxidant effect against fatty and aqueous food simulants with improved oxygen gas barrier properties. Interestingly, the natural chelation of curcumin with magnesium within the composites improves the bioavailability and antioxidant potency of curcumin. Moreover, the composites show reversible color change response detectable by the naked eye in basic solutions or vapors. This response is tested by placing the composite film inside a sealed plastic container containing shrimp at room temperature, but not in direct contact. Due to spoilage, a noticeable color change in the bio‐composites is recorded. These simple, cost‐effective, non‐toxic, and paper‐like flexible bio‐composites can be fabricated on large scale and be used in diverse applications ranging from sustainable packaging to medical applications and freshness indicators.",

The current solar cell technologies have been most widely employed to achieve this goal, but are limited to a single‐layer 2D surface. To harvest solar light more efficiently, a multilayer system capable of harvesting solar light in a cuboid through transparent photothermal thin films of iron oxide and a porphyrin compound is developed. Analogous to a multilayer capacitor, an array of transparent, spectral selective, photothermal thin films allows white light to penetrate them, not only collecting photon energy in a 3D space, but generating sufficient heat on each layer with significantly increased total surface area. In this fashion, thermal energy is generated via a multilayer photothermal system that functions as an efficient solar collector, energy converter and generator with high energy density. A solar‐activated thermal energy generator that can produce heat without any power supply and reach a maximum temperature of 76.1 °C is constructed. With a constant incoming white light (0.4 W cm −2 ), the thermal energy generated can be amplified 12‐fold via multilayers. The multilayer system extends another dimension in solar harvesting and paves a new path to energy generation for the energy‐neutral system.",

This work investigates the fabrication of bioinspired photothermal (BIPT) material by sputtering a copper layer on Phanera purpurea (PP) leaf for application in SSG systems. It is observed that the light absorbance of the BIPT material exceeds 92% in the wavelength region of 300–2500 nm. This is due to the light trapping effect caused by multi‐internal reflection inside the Cu‐coated leaf nanostructure. The BIPT material exhibits a low thermal conductivity and easy cleaning properties as a result of PP leaf surface features. A novel strategy in this work is the design of the BIPT material‐based SSG system to recycle the radiative heat loss for evaporation. The developed SSG system results in a solar steam efficiency of 83.7% and a water evaporation rate of 1.45 kg m −2 h −1 under 1 sun. It is also applied in seawater desalination and the produced water satisfies the WHO standards for ion concentrations in clean water. Because of the simple procedure and low cost, the sputtering Cu on the PP leaf can be potentially used in the mass production of BIPT material for seawater desalination.",

This non‐noble metal bimetallic synergistic catalytic protocol opens an avenue for efficiently producing biomass‐derived nitrogenous chemicals.",

In this work, carboxylate‐functionalized zeolitic imidazolate framework (F‐ZIF‐90) with good crystallinity and porosity is constructed from ZIF‐90 and employed as a robust heterogeneous catalyst to boost the reductive N ‐functionalization of various amines with CO 2 to furnish N ‐formyl compounds (up to 99% yield) in the presence of PhSiH 3 under an ambient environment. The imidazole carboxylate species (COO ‐ ) can not only activate hydrosilane and CO 2 to form the key intermediate formoxysliane but also activate amines to participate in the N ‐formylation reaction to obtain the target product. Moreover, it can enhance the catalyst capture and exchange ability toward ambient CO 2 . The powerful adsorption capacity of the F‐ZIF‐90 catalyst toward CO 2 is conducive to elevating CO 2 concentration around the active species. Theoretical calculations show that the carboxylate‐mediated conversion path undergoes the transition state of hydrosilane activation with a relatively lower energy barrier (Δ G = 26.9 kcal mol –1 ). F‐ZIF‐90 exhibits good thermochemical stability with no obvious activity attenuation after repeated use 5 times. This strategy opens a new avenue based on ZIFs to develop heterogeneous catalysts for reductive upgrading of CO 2 .",

However, the poor floating stability of CES steam generators when suffering wave slamming has limited their practical application in open water.

A single‐stage solar water purification device is constructed based on the photothermal aerogel, which attains an ultra‐high daily water yield of ≈32.6 L m −2 and surpasses a large amount of single‐stage solar stills. The steam generator can also be used to purify wastewater containing Co 2+ via adsorption. Gratifyingly, the Co 3 O 4 /C catalyst obtained from the pyrolysis of aerogels loaded with Co 2+ exhibits good catalytic activity for carbon monoxide oxidation, demonstrating the potential for waste conversion. This work provides new insights into the design of solar steam generators used in open water, and offers a promising way for the disposal and utilization of contaminated steam generators after wastewater purification.",

However, it is mandatory to substitute existing solvents, regrettably displaying severe limitations due to toxicity. Here, dimethyl 2‐methylglutarate (Rhodiasolv Iris) is validated for efficient liquid‐phase exfoliation of selected van der Waals materials, namely, MoS 2 , WS 2 , GeSe, and graphite. Here, we show that Iris‐assisted liquid phase exfoliation provides high yield (up to 52%) of flakes of 2D materials with aspect ratio as high as 500. Considering the various advantages of Iris over the state‐of‐the‐art solvents, including the absence of toxicity and its biodegradability, this work opens new possibilities for the ecofriendly production of 2D materials and for their extensive usage in industrial processes hitherto semi‐unexplored, owing to the toxicity of state‐of‐the‐art solvents (including the production of drinkable water or fruit juice concentration). Accordingly, the validation of Iris for sustainable liquid‐phase exfoliation of van der Waals crystals has intrinsic outstanding potential commercial impact. Moreover, here the values of the surface tension, Hansen solubility parameter, and viscosity of Rhodiasolv Iris are reported for the first time, which will be relevant also for any other sustainable process based on this new green solvent.",

Herein, the highly active photocatalyst composed of low‐crystalline TiO 2 prepared by simple heat treatment of amorphous material is reported. Transmission electron microscopy, X‐ray diffraction, Raman, X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy show that the low crystalline catalyst is hetero‐phase amorphous/anatase ( m amorphous : m anatase ≈ 2:3). Enhanced photocatalytic performance derives from the difference in conduction band potential between the phases, which promotes charge transfer and photochemical conversion. The photocatalyst calcined at 300 °C (T‐300) exhibits superior performance over commercial P25 (Degussa) for elimination of perrhenate, Re(VII), a surrogate for Tc(VII), and furthermore remains stable after several recycles. The high efficiency of Re(VII) removal by T‐300 is likely to correlate with active radicals ∙CO 2 − in the TiO 2 /HCOOH system. In addition to identifying a simple and effective photocatalyst, the results more generally elucidate titania‐based photocatalysis.",

To build a face‐to‐face interface in a 2D–2D heterojunction is an effective strategy to improve the charge carrier separation and utilization efficiency. In this work, the fabrication of a Step‐scheme heterojunction on thin titania (TiO 2 ) nanosheets with few‐layered MoO 3 structures is reported. With a decoration of a low dose of MoO 3 layer by ball milling method, TiO 2 (B) shows a three‐fold increase in the hydrogen evolution rate. The reaction mechanism and driving force of charge transfer in the S‐scheme heterojunction photocatalyst are investigated and discussed. Such 2D‐2D heterojunction improves photocatalytic reaction rate because photogenerated electrons and holes at the interface can be quickly transferred to the surface. In situ XPS and PL demonstrates that the presence of MoO 3 promotes the electron‐hole pair separation via the Step‐scheme heterojunction. Temperature programmed desorption of hydrogen shows that the heterojunction structure facilitates the desorption of hydrogen molecules. The approach used in this work to fabricate 2D–2D assembled structure thus improve the photocatalytic activity can be applied to other 2D metal oxides and sulfides, among others.",

Replacing synthetic adhesives with plant based ones that perform equally well may lead to a more sustainable ecosystem. Adhesives based on zein protein, derived from corn, can be made as strong as Super Glue. Unlike petroleum‐based adhesives, this plant protein is removable and degradable. Here, adhesives from the components zein and tannic acid function well on different substrates such as metals, plastics, and wood. This work presents the properties of selected adhesive formulations including bond strengths when the substrates are changed. To achieve near Super Glue strength, each substrate requires a different adhesive formulation. Temperature‐dependent curing, (potential of hydrogen) changes, and additional variables influence adhesion. Tack testing at room temperature is measured to provide comparisons between initial bonding and that achieved after curing. Adhesion to plastic substrates is less than wood or metal, but still plenty strong to measure. Aging of adhesive solutions as well as water resistance after curing is investigated. Infrared spectroscopy data are correlated with changes in color, age, and pH of adhesives. These new adhesives may lead to a sustainable and cleaner environment.",

Here, cuttlebone‐derived solar evaporators for long‐term desalination and water harvesting are reported. The solar evaporators are prepared by modifying the cuttlebone in turn with polydopamine, reduced graphene oxide, and polypyrrole as the photothermal composite. The solar evaporator shows i) excellent photothermal effect owing to a synergistic effect between the photothermal composite and its hierarchical micro‐/nanostructure, and ii) stable evaporation rate and good salt resistance even during the evaporation of concentrated brines (3.5–20 wt%) because of ultrafast water transport in the superhydrophilic 3D directional channels. The ultrafast water transport guarantees sufficient water supply, automatic very fast salt exchange, and a decline in salt concentration gradient. The transverse and longitudinal water streaming allows the increased salt concentration or even the temporarily deposited salt in/on the evaporator to be transferred back to the bulk brine in time. Consequently, 8.32 kg m −2 of freshwater is collected in 10 h solar desalination under weak natural sunlight, which is adequate for the daily drinking water demand of several people.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As a state‐of‐the‐art n‐type material, PC 61 BM ((6,6)‐phenyl C61 butyric‐ methylester) has been largely used as the top electron transporting layer (ETL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Whereas so far, there have been few reports on using pristine PC 61 BM as the bottom ETL in conventional (n‐i‐p‐type) PSCs, because it will be partially dissolved by the perovskite precursor solution (such as N , N ‐Dimethylformamide and Dimethyl sulfoxide). In this work, the successful application of pristine PC 61 BM as an annealing‐free ETL is reported for conventional PSCs, by ingeniously utilizing the “saturated solution” strategy. Specifically, the perovskite precursor solution is presaturated with PC 61 BM before deposition, in this way, not only the underlying PC 61 BM layer can be “reserved”, the added PC 61 BM in perovskite is also able to passivate defects in perovskite grain boundaries, thus facilitating charge transporting and reducing charge recombination. Encouragingly, the PC 61 BM ETL can avoid high‐temperature calcination or thermal annealing, thus greatly simplifying the manufacturing processes and reducing production costs. The CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3–x Cl x ‐based champion device shows the highest efficiency of 20.85% with high reproducibility. The strategy is simple, straightforward, and cost‐effective, when compared to most of the present reported ways for depositing ETLs.",

Therefore, it is necessary to conduct real‐time and accurate monitoring on transportation conditions to reduce the occurrence of emergencies. For possibly emergencies in other circumstances (e.g., meteorological disasters, geological disasters, and maritime disasters), emergency management is also critical to ensure the security of people and property. Prediction and early‐warning can help to detect abnormal situations and take measures, prior to potential risks. The basis of real‐time and effective transportation monitoring and emergency management requires a continuous and stable power supply for randomly distributed sensors and actuators. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been extensively investigated in different transportation circumstances to harvest the surrounding energy and drive distributed sensors for self‐powered wireless monitoring. This article surveys the research progress in TENGs in road transportation, bridge transportation, railway transportation, and maritime transportation, and related surrounding emergency management. Representative applications and the main achievements are summarized for these different application scenarios. A perspective on TENG research is given, and the remaining challenges facing TENGs in transportation and emergency management are discussed, along with potential solutions.",

In the optimized reaction conditions, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is used as the preferred green solvent and iron(III) sulfate as the best catalyst, recyclable up to three times. The HMF self‐etherification reaction is conducted both in milligram‐ and gram‐scale with isolated yields up to 99% and 81% respectively. OBMF is further derivatized via reduction to achieve 5,5′‐oxybis(methylene)bis(furan‐5,2‐diyl)dimethanol (OBMF‐H), a potential bisphenol‐A biobased alternative.

Both OBMF‐H and OBMF‐DC are achieved in high yields and are fully characterized. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis of OBMF, OBMF‐H, and OBMF‐DC establishes that these compounds are more thermally stable than HMF and its derivatives. In fact, they can withstand up to 200 °C before undergoing complete degradation rendering OBMF and its derivatives valuable bio‐based monomers for bioplastics prepared via polycondensation reaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ecofriendly supercapacitors (SCs) are fabricated with graphene electrodes printed on recycled‐plastics and utilized seawater as electrolyte. Those devices produced an energy density and capacitance of 50.4 Wh kg −1 and 250.4 F g −1 , respectively. Later, a mixture of Bi─Mg─Fe─O (BMO) oxides is added to the SC electrodes and the capacitance of the devices increased up to 209%. Subsequently, SC electrodes are recovered from used/tested devices and utilized as “seed mats” to grow bean plants. For this purpose, pinto bean seeds are wrapped with recycled SC electrodes and later subjected to a germination treatment together with control seeds. The germination parameters are calculated from the bean plants and found that: 1) 100% of the seeds initially wrapped with the SC electrodes germinated, in contrast, only 88.9% of the control seeds germinated and 2) The bean plants grown with the seed mats has the longest roots/shoots. This occurred because the seed mats have Mg/Fe micronutrients on their surface as well as OH/COOH groups (coming from the seawater), which promote the germination and growth of bean plants. The results of this research demonstrated that SC electrodes coated with BMO can be used as a substrate to promote the growth of bean plants, which is of interest for sustainable agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Perennial nectar‐producing wild plant species (WPS) cultivation for biogas production helps improve ecosystem services such as habitat functioning, erosion mitigation, groundwater protection, and carbon sequestration. These ecosystem services could be improved when WPS are harvested in late winter to produce pellets and briquettes as solid energy carriers for heat production. This study aims for gaining first insights into the use of WPS biomass as resource for pellet and briquette combustion with focus on two perennial WPS common tansy ( Tanacetum vulgare L.) and mugwort ( Artemisia vulgaris L.), and two biennial WPS yellow melilot ( Melilotus officinalis L.) and wild teasel ( Dipsacus fullonum L.). All WPS are found economically viable for pellet combustion. The main drivers are i) low cultivation costs, ii) subsidies, and iii) low pellet production costs due to low moisture contents. However, high ash contents in WPS biomass justify the need of i) blending with woody‐biomass or ii) supplementing with additives to attain international standards for household stoves. This approach appears technically feasible providing a research field with significant potential impacts. As 70% of the pellet market is demanded as household level, public concern about the legal framework of alternative plant biomass pellets must be overcome to develop this market.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many chemical reactions are accompanied by concerted phenomena, such as variance transition, structural changes, and particle formation. Various measurement techniques are employed to understand the whole picture of such concerted phenomena. A combination of small‐angle X‐ray scattering (SAXS), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), and X‐ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is useful for studying concerted phenomena that occur, for example, inside rechargeable batteries. This combination can cover large lengths from 1 Å to several hundred nm. Operando measurements using this combination of methods can follow reactions during the charging and discharging of a rechargeable battery in a single experimental run. Fixed‐exit optics enable irradiation at the same point in a wide energy range. By employing 2D detectors for XRD and SAXS and using a quick XAFS technique, one can make the interval of each measurement sufficiently short to track various phenomena during charging and discharging. Here, an application of the system for alternating SAXS/XRD/XAFS measurements constructed in BL28XU, SPring‐8, Japan to the study of rechargeable batteries, is presented.",

Recovering and regenerating the cathode material from spent power lithium‐ion batteries in an easy and environmentally friendly manner remains a significant challenge and an area of focus in battery research. Hence, a green and convenient method to recover FePO 4 from spent LiFePO 4 cathode powder by using Na 2 S 2 O 8 as an oxidizer and as cathode materials for lithium/sodium‐ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs) is reported. Benefiting from the remarkable graphene oxide (GO) and vanadium oxide (V 2 O 5 ) coating, the regenerated FePO 4 –V 2 O 5 –graphene oxide (FePO 4 –V 2 O 5 –GO) is suitable for Li/Na storage (153 mAh g −1 at 0.2C/118 mAh g −1 at 0.5C). The high capacity retention, that stable for 300 cycles in LIBs and 300 cycles for SIBs, is also realized due to the stable structure. This work provides a green strategy for regenerating the cathode of spent lithium‐ion batteries and designing cathodes of alkali metal ion batteries.",

Nevertheless, they also face significant challenges, particularly in the form of zinc dendrite growth and inadequate stability. Here, a strategy based on reduced graphene oxides‐zirconium dioxide (rGO/ZrO 2 ) hybrid interface to enable long lifespan zinc metal anodes is proposed. Via in situ electrochemical deposition and self‐assembly method, rGO and ZrO 2 are deposited on the zinc metal anode successively, and their loading is optimized subsequently. In the functionalized interface, rGO serves as the skeleton and improves electrolyte ion diffusion, while ZrO 2 relieves the electric field concentration problem and inhibits dendrite growth. As a result, the Zn@rGO@ZrO 2 symmetric cell achieves a highly reversible cycle of 3000 h at 2.0 mA cm −2 /1.0 mA h cm −2 and fast reaction kinetics.",

Herein, Bi 2 Mo 2.5 (S,O) 10 oxysulfide (BiMoOS) anchored on unmodified and surface‐modified activated carbon (AC) via B and N doping is synthesized for efficient PHER, aiming that B and N doping into carbon framework can modify the surface textural features which act as anchoring sites for the host Bi 2 Mo 2.5 (S,O) 10 and boost its photocatalytic activity by increasing specific surface area via preventing aggregation through a uniform distribution. Thus, the BiMoOS@B─N─AC catalyst achieved excellent stability and PHER performance (564.2 µmol h −1 H 2 under visible light). The doped B and N in AC create structural disorder/defects, active sites and induce electron delocalization in B─N─AC, used as the anchoring sites for BiMoOS catalysts and stimulate the adsorption and activation kinetics of the H 2 O molecules, and also provide a highly conductive network that enhances charge transport and stability of BiMoOS@B─N─AC. With the advantages of the modified B─N─AC, the oxygen vacancy‐anchored BiMoOS exhibited superb PHER. Hence, B and N co‐doping into the carbon lattice is a promising approach to enriching the anchoring site for boosting metallic nanocatalyst stability and catalytic performance.",

This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of air pollution in Morocco, delineating the research status and identifying gaps.

From these, 64 original studies are deemed eligible and selected, focusing on air pollution in Moroccan regions or cities. Review articles and those dealing with indoor air quality are excluded, with no restriction on specific pollutant. Research highlights road traffic as the primary contributor to air pollution in Morocco, followed by industrial activities. Exposure to air pollutants is associated with adverse health effects, including mortality, lung disease, respiratory disorders, asthma attacks, and cardiovascular disease. Pollution levels vary among cities, with Casablanca, Kenitra, and Essaouira consistently facing higher pollution levels due to transportation and industrial emissions. Altitude also influences air quality, with higher‐altitude areas generally experiencing lower pollutant concentrations. The review highlights the need for extensive research on air pollution's health and economic effects, improved air quality modeling, and broader pollutant focus beyond just regulated ones.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Unrestricted access to clean drinking water is essential for the well‐being of the global population, yet this necessary resource is not universally guaranteed, particularly amidst the escalating climate crisis that accentuates disparities across regions. Harnessing solar energy in conjunction with advanced synthetic solar absorbent hydrogels (SAHs) is increasingly recognized as a promising solution and a significant challenge in addressing the purification of brackish water sustainably. This work outlines the development of a SAH using the thermosensitive polymer poly( N ‐isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) in combination with alginate (Alg), enriched with poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanoparticles (NPs). Through solar evaporation tests using different conducting polymer (CP) concentrations, a discernible relationship between the ratio of free water to intermediate water (FW/IW) within the hydrogel structure and its performance is observed. The hydrogel's remarkable evaporation rate for synthetic seawater (2.82 kg m −2 h −1 ) aligns with the lowest FW/IW, which is directly related to a reduction in water vaporization enthalpy. Characterization of intermediate water enables easy adjustment of the optimal conductive polymer content within the hydrogel. This technology, based on thermosensitive materials, not only introduces innovative methodologies for designing and customizing functional composite materials but also aligns with global objectives by addressing challenges in sustainable drinking water supply without additional energy inputs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines the chemical characteristics of four plant‐derived bio‐oils, including waste cooking oils, to address a research gap concerning their effects on the thermal stability and moisture susceptibility of asphalt. While bio‐oils are known to soften asphalt, their specific impact on these properties is less understood. The study evaluates four different bio‐oils (B1–B4) derived from various waste vegetable sources to determine their influence on asphalt performance. The findings indicate that bio‐oils with higher purity and lower polyunsaturated fatty acid content offer better resistance to heat and UV‐induced degradation. Bio‐oils with lower iodine values also show improved resistance to moisture damage. Notably, bitumen composites containing bio‐oil B2 do not negatively affect asphalt's moisture resistance, while others increase its moisture susceptibility. Tests with liquid anti‐strip agents reveal that silanes and amine‐based agents are the most effective at reducing moisture damage. These results underscore the importance of selecting bio‐oils with low acid and iodine values, low polyunsaturated fatty acid content, and high purity for use in asphalt. This study supports sustainability and resource conservation by recommending bio‐oils that preserve the durability of bio‐modified asphalts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To attain net zero energy‐ready building (NZErB) status, various research efforts have focused on identifying potential strategies and creating stringent code compliances for builders. This review presents a comparative assessment of Canadian newly constructed, retrofitted, and potential retrofit buildings from the mid‐1900s to 1990, all aiming for NZErB status. 22 case studies from climate zones 5, 6, and 7a are evaluated, including 12 new constructions and 4 retrofitted, and 6 potential retrofit buildings. A life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis is conducted to understand the environmental impacts of different insulation materials. Additionally, this review highlights retrofitted buildings measures toward climate resilience, challenges inretrofitting, andstrategies for achieving high‐quality retrofits. The work concluded that 83.3% of new buildings achieved level 5 in thermal energy demand intensity (TEDI), while 70% of completed and potential retrofits reached level 5 in mechanical energy usage intensity (MEUI). Cellulose insulation showed the lowest global warming potential (GWP) at 12.07 kg CO₂‐e·m −3 . By comparing the performance of new constructions with completed and potential retrofits, this review provides valuable insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of retrofitting older buildings to attain net zero energy readiness.",

Nonetheless, the most efficient TENGs are based on synthetic plastics or chemically treated materials. This study demonstrates a chemical‐free, natural wood‐based TENG with performance comparable to chemically treated wood‐TENGs. The natural wood is paired with different polymers as an opposite layers in contact‐separation mode, using various electrodes. The pristine wood‐polytetrafluoroethylene (PW: PTFE) TENG device with a large area of 3 × 3 cm 2 exhibits a high open circuit voltage of 110 V, a short‐circuit current of 0.72 µA, and generates charge of 23.6 ± 0.3 nC. Finally, to illustrate the viability of PW: PTFE triboelectric devices for practical applications, a prototype with a 20 × 18 cm 2 active area is discreetly inserted beneath a carpet to harness the energy generated by individuals walking or running across its surface. The cyclic nature of human motion ensures a sustained regimen of contact and separation, thereby yielding a consistent output of voltage and current, with a maximum open circuit voltage of 110 V, a short‐circuit current of 193 µA, and a charge of 3.5 µC.

    "abstract": "Abstract Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is rapidly becoming the main precursor for layered oxide cathodes used in lithium ion batteries. Current hydrometallurgical method for LiOH production uses substantial amounts of chemicals and creates wastes, leaving behind a negative environmental footprint. Electrodialysis is emerging as a more sustainable technology for LiOH production, effectively eliminating the conventional chemical addition step and its subsequent waste management. Additionally, hydrogen is generated as a by‐product during the electrodialysis process. Various configurations of the electrodialysis cell have been employed to maximize the energy efficiency of the process and the purity of the LiOH product. Nonetheless, this review found that there is a lack of concerted effort in developing ion exchange membranes specific for LiOH production. Current membrane technologies are not tailored to LiOH production, with limited selectivity to lithium in relative to other monovalent cations, as well as relying heavily on harmful perfluoroalkyl (PFA)‐based polymeric membranes. In this review, special attention is given to the state of the art in the testing and development of membranes, i.e., cation and anion exchange membranes, bipolar membranes, as well as novel membranes that are potentially low‐cost, non‐fluorinated, lithium‐selective with high chemical stability and mechanical robustness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transition metal oxides have attracted much attention due to their good electrical conductivity, high chemical stability, and easy electronic structure modulation. However, it is still a great challenge to solve the problems of sluggish reaction kinetics and high overpotential in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their poor intrinsic activity. Herein, a lattice‐expanded Ni‐decorated MoO 2 array (Ni‐MoO 2 ‐700) catalyst is prepared for the alkaline HER. Unlike most of the reported literature, the decoration of metal heteroatoms may lead to lattice expansion of the carrier catalyst. In contrast, lattice expansion of Ni is also achieved by adjusting the annealing temperature in this work. The Ni‐induced lattice‐expanding effect can not only modulate the electronic structure of the catalyst but also accelerate electron transfer during the reaction, thus increasing its intrinsic activity for the HER. As a result, Ni‐MoO 2 ‐700 exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic activity with an overpotential of 74.9 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in 1.0 m KOH, which is far superior to that of most of the reported advanced Ni‐ and Mo‐based materials. This work provides deep intrinsic insight and a great opportunity to design efficient transition metal oxide catalysts for the alkaline HER.",

The BODIPY‐based system, coated onto a platinum surface, is evaluated for its electrochemical and photocatalytic performance under light illumination. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry measurements reveals enhanced photocurrent responses, confirming the catalyst's ability to effectively drive CO 2 reduction. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) analysis identifies the formation of ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) as a major reaction product, showing that its yield increased with extended reaction times. Additionally, the photocatalyst demonstrates remarkable performance with significantly increasing turnover numbers (TON) and turnover frequencies (TOF) over time, indicating stable and sustained catalytic activity. With a Faradaic efficiency of 34.79% at a potential of ‐1.15 V, this BODIPY system exhibits both high activity and long‐term stability. The combination of efficient electron transfer and visible light absorption by the carbazole‐BODIPY donor‐acceptor structure positions this system as a highly promising candidate for sustainable CO 2 conversion applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) demonstrate exceptional efficiency in converting hydrogen into electricity and hold great promise for mitigating carbon emissions. However, the high loading of platinum (Pt) (0.2–0.35 mg Pt cm −2 ) in the cathode catalytic layer (CL) poses a significant obstacle to the commercialization of PEMFCs. Although current research has succeeded in reducing Pt usage in the cathode CL, carbon corrosion remains a major issue that leads to decreased output power density and shortened service life. The enhancement of support stability poses a greater challenge compared to the improvement of intrinsic stability in Pt‐based alloys, primarily due to the thermodynamic instability of carbon during practical operating conditions. Recently, extensive efforts are dedicated to exploiting advanced carbon supports through the utilization of innovative nanostructure design and synthesis techniques, as well as profound mechanistic insights. This review highlights the intriguing advancements in the modification and synthesis of carbon materials, while also summarizing the underlying mechanisms and potential factors that impact the corrosion reaction of carbon. The general ideas and strategies for the development of carbon materials with desirable nanostructures and physicochemical properties are outlined in detail to design low‐Pt CL with highly efficient mass transfer and superior stability.",

The ratio and weight percentage of NC NPs on the PVDF surface are studied and optimized to improve the TENG performance. With the addition of 6 wt% 50:50 ratio of NC (NC55) NPs to the PVDF matrix, the negative surface static potential of the composite nanofiber (6PNC) attained a saturation value of −560 V after 6 h. This is 2.9 times higher than the surface static potential of the neat nanofiber (0PNC −190 V). Compared with the 0PNC TENG device, the optimized 6PNC device displayed 7.1‐fold (57–408 V), 6.3‐fold (1.6–10.2 µA), and 8.6‐fold (17–147 nC) improvements in open‐circuit voltage, short‐circuit current, and surface charge, respectively.

To reduce the cost of thermal storage and increase the working temperature of the subsystems for greater efficiency, appropriate storage materials must be identified for study. Unfortunately, there is an enormous search space of salt mixtures that are suitable candidates for thermal storage and must be analyzed for cost effectiveness to determine which candidates are the best. To lessen the experimental burden, this article combines previously validated theories for estimating the properties of salt mixtures with an analytic design optimization method to better estimate the true cost of each candidate. Five hundred and sixty three binary, ternary, and quaternary mixtures are analyzed. Five mixtures are identified as the prime candidates for a cascaded latent heat thermal energy storage system for a supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle generator. This system is cheaper than the Sunshot Initiative cost targets, bringing the solar thermal paradigm into cost competition with fossil fuels.",

The conversion of CO 2 into value‐added chemicals and fuels by solar energy is an immediate solution to mitigate CO 2 emissions, while providing global energy security. In this work, boron‐ and phosphorus‐doped silicon nanocrystals (ncSi), comprised of three earth‐abundant elements, are investigated for gas‐phase heterogeneous photoreduction of CO 2 for the first time. Surface dopants are demonstrated to induce CO 2 adsorption capacity. Remarkably, phosphorus‐doped ncSi is found to be the best performer among the singly doped and co‐doped ncSi samples, doubling the rate of pristine ncSi. The enhancement of activity is attributed to the combination of the number of surface hydrides, its surface hydrophobicity, the addition of electronegative surface atoms, and perhaps an enhanced hydridic character of the SiH induced by the n‐doping effect. Significantly, boron and phosphorus dopants are shown to provide increased stability of CO 2 reduction activity compared to pristine ncSi after storing the samples in air for 2 weeks. These noteworthy findings open up a pathway to develop sustainable alternatives for existing photocatalysts for CO 2 conversion.",

Characterization results demonstrate the successful formation of high purity composite systems in which the surface of ZnO nanostructures is decorated by ultra‐small amounts of amorphous titania, whose content can be conveniently tailored as a function of deposition time. Photocurrent density measurements in sunlight‐triggered water splitting highlight a remarkable performance enhancement with respect to single‐phase zinc and titanium oxides, with up to a threefold photocurrent increase compared to bare ZnO. These results, mainly traced back to the formation of ZnO/TiO 2 heterojunctions yielding an improved photocarrier separation, show that the target nanocomposites are attractive photoanodes for efficient PEC water splitting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lignosulfonate (LS) is a large‐scale surplus product of the forest and paper industries, and has primarily been utilized as a low‐cost plasticizer in making concrete for the construction industry. LS is an anionic redox‐active polyelectrolyte and is a promising candidate to boost the charge capacity of the positive electrode (positrode) in redox‐supercapacitors. Here, the physical‐chemical investigation of how this biopolymer incorporates into the conducting polymer PEDOT matrix, of the positrode, by means of counter‐ion exchange is reported. Upon successful incorporation, an optimal access to redox moieties is achieved, which provides a 63% increase of the resulting stored electrical charge by reversible redox interconversion. The effects of pH, ionic strength, and concentrations, of included components, on the polymer–polymer interactions are optimized to exploit the biopolymer‐associated redox currents. Further, the explored LS‐conducting polymer incorporation strategy, via aqueous synthesis, is evaluated in an up‐scaling effort toward large‐scale electrical energy storage technology. By using an up‐scaled production protocol, integration of the biopolymer within the conducting polymer matrix by counter‐ion exchange is confirmed and the PEDOT‐LS synthesized through optimized strategy reaches an improved charge capacity of 44.6 mAh g −1 .",

Two separate experimental designs are conducted to optimize the reduction of fiber diameter with minimum defects. The first focuses on the optimization of the solution properties and electrospinning parameters. The second is employed to optimize environmental conditions to further reduce the fiber diameter. Morphological analysis shows a minimum average fiber diameter of 77 ± 15 nm with minimal beading. The as‐spun nanofibers are subsequently calcinated to produce barium titanate nanofibers with an average diameter of 45 ± 9 nm. As expected, the average grain size increases as the heat treatment duration increases. Piezoresponse force microscopy reveals that the fiber diameter is inversely related to the d 33 piezoelectric coefficient. Individual crystallites of 25 nm in size along the axis of the 48 nm fiber exhibit d 33 coefficients as high as 76 pm V −1 . A flexible piezoelectric device composed of nanofibers with an average diameter of 45 nm embedded within polydimethylsiloxane produces a maximum voltage and power output of 7.94 V p–p and 1.95 µW cm −2 , respectively, at a load resistance of 3.33 MΩ and a strain of 0.16%.",

However, its complex and multistep thermal decomposition process has left the idea that AB can only be an irreversible hydrogen storage material. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of a novel nanosizing strategy in overcoming current drawbacks. By (a) successfully restricting the particle size of AB to the nanoscale (≈50 nm), and (b) discreetly encapsulating the synthesised nanosized AB particles within a nickel (Ni) matrix, AB showed unforeseen hydrogen reversibility along its decomposition path. Owing to the catalytic effect of Ni and the embedment of AB with the Ni matrix, this nanosizing approach reduced the hydrogen release temperature, suppressed the melting of AB and the production of volatiles by‐products including diborane and borazine. But more remarkably, this approach enabled the reversible release and uptake of pure hydrogen at 200 °C and 6 MPa H 2 pressure, only. Reversibility is thought to occur through an iminoborane oligomer resulting from the initial decomposition of the nanosized AB/Ni matrix. This result demonstrates for the first time the possibility of tailoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The proliferation of portable electronic devices has resulted in an increase of e‐waste that is generated after their use. One of the most hazardous components in e‐waste are batteries, due to their content of heavy metals and toxic chemicals. Fuel cells and redox flow batteries have been recognized as more sustainable alternatives to Li‐based batteries for powering portable applications. Although they provide comparable energy and power densities, they still face some challenges because they rely on proton exchange membranes based on nonenvironmentally friendly, high‐priced perfluorosulfonic acid copolymers that require energy‐intense manufacturing and recycling procedures. In this work, eco‐friendly and sustainable biopolymer electrolyte membranes (BioPEMs) are synthesized from biopolymers like chitosan, cellulose, and starch. These BioPEMs bring forth advantages in performance, sustainability, and cost. Additionally, they present good chemical and mechanical stability, high ionic conductivity in the same order of magnitude as Nafion membranes. Two alternatives of cellulose–chitosan based BioPEMs are successfully applied into primary redox batteries using benign eco‐friendly redox chemistries, delivering open circuit voltages above 0.75 V and power output up to 2.5 mW cm −2 . These results demonstrate BioPEMs capability to improve biodegradable batteries in sectors requiring a transient electrical energy, such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, or packaging.",

However, high ionic conductivity is usually observed at high temperatures upon the stabilization of adequate crystalline phases enabling fast ionic mobility. Here, an extremely simple strategy to significantly increase the ionic conductivity of complex borohydrides is reported. By exposing complex borohydrides to oxygen, the rearrangement of surface atoms upon the oxidation of borohydride particles and the resulting defects lead to extremely high ionic conductivity. NaBH 4 and LiBH 4 exposed to 5% O 2 show an ionic conductivity of ≈10 −3 S cm −1 at 35 °C. Similarly, oxidized Mg(BH 4 ) 2 displays a conductivity of ≈10 −6 S cm −1 at 25 °C instead of 9.63 × 10 −13 S cm −1 . To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is to date, the simplest approach to tune the properties of borohydrides toward high ionic conductivity at room temperature as it does not rely on the difficult synthesis of large cage boron based anions to substitute BH 4 − and allow better ionic conduction paths. Owing its simplicity, the finding has the potential to enable new avenues toward the realization of viable complex borohydride based solid‐state electrolytes.",

To enhance the utilization of fertilizers and pesticides, pesticide–fertilizer combined nanocomposites are developed to prolong foliar retention and play a synergistic effect of weeding and nourishing for plant growth. The pesticide–fertilizer combined nanocomposites are prepared based on positive‐charge functionalized mesoporous silica and polydopamine, by chelating micronutrients (Zn 2+ ) and loading pesticide 2,4‐D. A high loading capacity of Zn 2+ (233.4 mg g −1 ) and 2,4‐D (17.8%) is achieved. Zn 2+ and the pesticide show excellent pH‐responsive release behavior. At pH 7.0, the cumulative release is 45.35% for the pesticide after 144 h and 17% for Zn 2+ after 30 days. These results reveal that the pesticide–fertilizer combined nanocomposites can remove weeds quickly and provide nutrients for crop growth in the long term. The germination rate of purslane dramatically decreases when treating with the nanocomposites, while that of corn seeds is not influenced. Excellent adhesion performance of the nanocomposites is observed on a hydrophobic surface, which can effectively reduce the risk of being washed away by rain. All the results indicate that the pesticide–fertilizer combined nanocomposites with a good synergistic effect is environmentally friendly for large‐scale application in sustainable modern agriculture.",

In this work, the possibility of using alginate, a biocompatible and natural polysaccharide, is explored for the preparation of both oxide (TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , and yttria‐stabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ)) macrobeads and an active blend of rich carbon nanoparticles, depolymerized alginate, formic acid, and a complex mixture of other organic acids. In particular, the active blend is obtained through low‐energy‐demanding microwave assisted digestion of sodium alginate solution, and it is used to enhance the decontamination activity of oxide macrobeads in mild conditions (e.g., low temperature, no pH buffers, and visible illumination). It is demonstrated that the alginate‐derived active blend obtained without the addition of any other chemicals increases primarily the adsorption capability of oxide macrobeads toward positively charged pollutants (methylene blue, crystal violet, and tetracaine) and, also, the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 during their degradation. Interestingly, functionalization with the obtained alginate‐derived active blend enables better performance in comparison with functionalization of its single components or with carbon‐dots (C‐Dots) obtained with conventional and more energy‐demanding hydrothermal methods, enabling them to obtain a fully sustainable, environmentally‐friendly system for water remediation.",

In this research, wood sawdust and high density polyethylene (HDPE) mixtures have been investigated under plasma steam gasification with various HDPE contents (0–100%), at different input plasma powers (16–24 kW) and varying steam flow/carbon flow (S/C) ratios (0.2–1.8). The single‐factor analysis indicates that the real H 2 yield at 80 wt% HDPE is 23.99% higher than the theoretically calculated results. This significant improvement in hydrogen yield confirms the synergetic gasification effects between HDPE and biomass. The yield and proportion of H 2 show a climbing trend with the increase of input power, while showing a trend from rising to descending with the increase of S/C ratio. Under the optimal conditions (the HDPE ratio of 80%, the input power of 22 kW, the S/C ratio of 1.0), the H 2 yield is as high as 78.55 mol kg −1 and the proportion of H 2 in syngas reaches 66.91%. Redundancy analysis shows that the HDPE content, input power and S/C ratio can explain 39.8%, 12.4%, and 10.6% of the variations of syngas properties respectively. The input power has the largest correlation with the increase of H 2 yield among these three factors.",

Herein, guidelines for selecting carbon support materials suitable for CO 2 RR are reported. In a gaseous CO 2 ‐fed CO 2 RR electrolyzer, an Ag nanoparticle‐composited carbon nanocage (denoted as Ag/CNC) electrode exhibits an optimal performance for CO 2 RR with a partial current density of ≈400 mA cm −2 . Ag/CNC showcases a uniformly dispersed morphology with Ag nanoparticles and sufficient hydrophobicity after the reaction to prevent flooding, which is known to inhibit the mass transfer of CO 2 . Furthermore, the CNCs possess small amounts of carbon defects; this suppresses the catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is a side reaction of CO 2 RR. Results of a three‐stack cell experiment with the Ag/CNC electrode reveal the possibility of a support‐based strategy for achieving an industrial‐level scaling of CO 2 RR. This study suggests that the support material for CO 2 RR should be considered not only on the basis of the morphology of carbon, uniform dispersion of Ag nanoparticles, and hydrophobicity of the electrode but also factors influencing the HER, such as carbon defects.",

Herein, a novel strategy is demonstrated to turn expired drugs into a novel tribopositive material in a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). To realize the proposed method, three types of expired tablets such as paracetamol, nimesulide, and guaiphenesin are employed as tribopositive materials in TENG devices. Owing to their high electron donating capability with hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups, these drugs reveal strong positive triboelectric potential. The proposed TENG devices yield open circuit voltages ranging from 267 to 561 V, while the short circuit current varies from 28 to 53 µA under a pneumatic air cylinder of 10 Hz. Impressively, the drug‐based TENG can scavenge energy to light up to 169 commercial light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). This excellent performance makes these expired drugs a promising positive tribomaterial, providing a possible solution to recycle a huge amount of pharmaceutical waste.

The naturally sedimented Ti 3 C 2 T x film serves as the substrate to minimize aggregation of the CoNi‐DH nanoarrays to enhance the electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure comprised of the CoNi‐DH interconnected nanoarrays promotes electrolyte access. By taking advantage of the excellent electrical conduction and high theoretical specific capacitance, the flexible CoNi‐DH@Ti 3 C 2 T x electrode in the supercapacitor delivers a superior specific capacitance of 919.5 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 , and remarkable capacitance retention of 89.6% after 5000 cycles at 20 A g −1 . Density‐functional theory calculations are performed to investigate the charge density difference and partial density of states of CoNi‐DH@Ti 3 C 2 T x and the theoretical assessment suggests that the chemical bonds between Ti 3 C 2 T x and CoNi‐DH are critical to the charge transport, electrical conductivity, and structural stability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plastics are excellent materials owing to their multipurpose uses. They are simple synthetic macromolecules with versatile properties. On the disposal front, nearly 90% of the plastic products are discarded only after a single use, which keeps accumulating, impacting both terrestrial and marine life. About 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste have accumulated worldwide from the time of the plastic revolution. Around 79% of plastic waste amasses in landfills every year, and 2.41 million tonnes of the waste enters oceans. The accumulation of this waste poses harmful threats to the environment and flora and fauna of land and aquatic habitats. To keep a check on the generation and collection of plastic waste, the utilization of alternative materials developed from biodegradable polymers as substitutes to plastics seems quite sound. The present perspective highlights single use plastic's (SUP) challenges and the importance of biodegradable polymers as possible substitutes to SUPs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Direct solar steam generation (DSSG) is currently one of the most promising desalination methods due to its high energy conversion efficiency. The key element of DSSG is solar thermal conversion materials (STCMs), which absorb incoming solar illumination owing to their excellent solar absorption and convert light to heat. Although many types of STCMs have been applied to DSSG, there are still some existing problems such as complex preparation, high cost, and low energy conversion efficiency. In this work, carbonized corncob, as an example of inexpensive agricultural waste, is prepared as a STCM, which has porous honeycomb‐like pores, and hydrophilic functional groups, ensuring sufficient water transportation. Different pyrolytic temperatures lead to different size pores, content of amorphous carbon, and amount of oxygen functional groups, which affect the water transportation efficiency and light‐to‐heat conversion efficiency. Benefiting from developed pores, 95.7% solar absorption and thick‐hole wall, the carbonized corncob pyrolyzed at 800 °C reaches a solar‐to‐steam conversion efficiency of 86%, and its water evaporation rate is 1.62 kg m –2 h –1 , higher than most biomass reported so far. Using cost‐effective materials and methods to carry out efficient photothermal conversion is of great significance for the realization of practical seawater desalination and sewage treatment.",

Coordination of palladium centers is demonstrated by a variety of techniques, including X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and total X‐ray fluorescence. The stable phenanthroline‐Pd(II) coordination avoids leaching of metal centers to the reaction medium, where deactivation processes through nanoparticle formation limits the catalytic activities observed for homogeneous systems.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the context of diminishing atmospheric CO 2 emissions, there is an urgent need to develop processes that can be carried out at a scale commensurate with appropriate CO 2 volumes. One possible reaction is the transformation of CO 2 to methane (Sabatier reaction). Due to its chemical stability, catalytic CO 2 hydrogenation to methane is carried out at temperatures of 450 °C or higher and pressures above 5 bars, thus, requiring a significant energy input. One alternative possibility to conventional thermal catalysis is the use of solar light as the primary energy, performing the photocatalytic CO 2 hydrogenation. In this broad context, the present study shows the photocatalytic activity of nanometric films of oriented Ru nanoparticles (NPs) strongly grafted on defective graphene. These graphene films (thinner than 20 nm) containing Ru NPs nanoplatelets (less than 2 nanomol Ru /cm 2 ) are among the most active photocatalysts ever prepared for CO 2 hydrogenation and operate through photoinduced charge separation.",

Once the extraction and organosolv pretreatment conditions are selected, solubilized lignin is recovered from the pretreatment liquor using different methods.

The organosolv pretreatment (50% ethanol catalyzed with 1% H 2 SO 4 , 140 °C, 60 min, 15% biomass) results in a delignified solid with 81% of enzymatic digestibility and a high purity organosolv lignin (&gt;71%), rich in guaiacyl units.",

However, such process is plagued by the use of high‐cost precious metal‐based catalysts (such as Pt, RuO 2 ). Hereby, the use of a low‐cost Nitrogen and Sulfur co‐doped carbon‐supported cobalt sulfide dual‐functional electrocatalyst derived from imidazole modified lignin for overall water splitting is presented. To introduce nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms in the carbon structure, lignin is modified by imidazolation through thiol‐alkynes click reaction. Imidazole‐lignin shows a strong chelation tendancy with cobalt salt, and N and the S co‐doped cobalt sulfide catalyst (IL‐Co@GC‐PO) is obtained by pyrolysis. The IL‐Co@GC‐PO has an oxygen evolution potential of 1.57 V and a hydrogen evolution overpotential of 204 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . During the overall water splitting process, the IL‐Co@GC‐PO catalysts require only 1.58 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , which is equivalent to the performance of the system composed of the noble metal Pt/C||RuO 2 . This work not only provides a strategy for the preparation of N and S co‐doped cobalt sulfide catalysts, but also provides guidance for using lignin as a carbon source to design and develop cheap electrocatalysts.",

Recently, laser processing has emerged as a promising route to obtain micron‐thick films of highly graphitic carbons.

Meanwhile, the analysis of active bacteria density and antibacterial rate reveal the effects of the system airtightness and the flow velocity of bacterial solution on sterilization performance. Furthermore, the investigations on bacterial morphology and solution composition demonstrate that the superior sterilization efficiency of self‐powered sterilizer is caused by the current‐induced deformation of bacteria membranes, and the generation of active chlorine and superoxide in sterilization system.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has slow kinetics hindering overall process. Recently, cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH) 2 ) with high activity and stability for OER has attracted more attention. During the OER process, the Co 2+ in Co(OH) 2 is further oxidized to Co 3+ and CoOOH species are true active sites. However, the low conductivity of Co(OH) 2 hinders its oxidization to CoOOH. In addition, spontaneous growth of Co(OH) 2 agglomerates easily during hydrothermal treatment, leading to decreased active sites. Herein, an efficient strategy is developed to construct highly dispersive Co(OH) 2 nanosheets vertically grown on V 2 O 5 nanoflowers (Co(OH) 2 /V 2 O 5 ) at room temperature. The V 5+ of V 2 O 5 can oxidize Co 2+ of Co(OH) 2 into Co 3+ , resulting in in situ formations of CoOOH species favorable to the OER process. In situ Raman also investigates that the OH ‐ species are inserted more easily into the interlayer of Co(OH) 2 of (Co(OH) 2 /V 2 O 5 ) than that of pure Co(OH) 2 . Therefore, the hybrid Co(OH) 2 /V 2 O 5 exhibits low overpotentials of 320 and 370 mV at a current density of 10 and 50 mV cm ‐2 , respectively, and a small Tafel slope of 68 mV dec ‐1 .",

Herein, a hydrophobic photocatalyst with TiO 2 nanosheet arrays grown on hydrophobic carbon paper (TiO 2 ‐HCP) is fabricated using a combination of magnetron sputtering and hydrothermal method, and its unique structure not only endows it excellent light absorption and effective carrier spatial separation but also avoids the hydrophobic reagent covering reactive sites. When the interphase reaction shifts from solid–liquid diphase to gas‐liquid‐solid tri‐phase, the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction over TiO 2 ‐HCP mainly generates CO molecules and effectively suppresses HER due to the HCP suppressing the mass transfer of H 2 O molecules to active sites. Notably, amounts of H 2 byproduct can further react with CO 2 /CO to produce high value‐added CH 4 resultant by modifying the N‐doped TiO 2 ‐HCP with nickel/nickel oxide species. In the tri‐phase interfacial CO 2 photoreduction system, the CH 4 formation rate of Ni@N‐doped TiO 2 ‐HCP reaches 134.17 µmol m −2 h −1 (about 74.6% selectivity) and total carbon derivatives selectivity is about 93%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Photovoltaic (PV) cells are one of the most common devices to harvest solar radiation and convert it into usable electrical power. However, normal silicone‐based photovoltaic cells work best within the visible light region. Conventional PV panels can use 15–30% of the total energy received, while the remainder is reflected or converted into waste heat. Not only do other wavelengths have lower conversion efficiencies, but they may also increase the cell surface temperature and decrease its overall efficiency. To solve this problem, spectral beam splitting is a potential approach for converting solar energy efficiently. Even though spectral‐splitting systems have high theoretical conversion efficiencies, they have not yet reached the commercial level. The current study describes the advancements in beam‐splitting systems based on thermal PV cells, multijunction cells, nano‐film, conventional, and nanofluids over the last decade. The mechanisms of various splitting system techniques and several hybrid applications are thoroughly discussed in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of solar energy utilization and the considerations influencing system efficiency. Even though the cost increase can be offset by the increased energy conversion efficiency and controlled wavelengths, the system's stability must be addressed for future practical applications.",

However, when applied in real sea water environment, the undissolved salt accumulation and bacteria adhesion will cause blockage and fouling problem of the evaporator, and deteriorate its evaporation performance. Herein, a solar evaporator based on hollow cylinder‐shaped photocatalytic modified ceramic with renewability and antibacterial activity is fabricated for efficient seawater desalination. This evaporator can reach an evaporation rate of 3.43 kg m −2 h −1 in the normal environment (1 sun irradiation, 50% ambient relative humidity and 0 m s −1 convective airflow) and also can reach a rate of 28.9 kg m −2 h −1 in the controlled environment (1 sun irradiation, 10% ambient relative humidity and 5 m s −1 convective airflow) due to the sufficient effective evaporation area and timely vapor diffusion. Meanwhile, after long‐term desalination of real seawater, the blocked evaporators can be regenerated by acid treatment. The evaporator also shows 91.7% antibacterial ratio due to photocatalytic modification. In the field environment, the array evaporator shows a good evaporation performance of 54.5 kg m −2 for continuous 10 h. Finally, the empirical formula is obtained to quantitatively analyze the environmental factors and predict the evaporation rate in practical application.",

The implementation of a heterojunction for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution represents a promising solution to the current energy predicament. In this work, a 0D/2D S‐scheme graphdiyne/NiCo 2 S 4 (GDY/NiCo 2 S 4 ) heterojunction is constructed by semi‐crystalline NiCo 2 S 4 nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on the surface of GDY nanosheets through hydrothermal method. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) demonstrated the thickness of GDY nanosheets is 2.8 nm. The unique 2D laminar structure and porous structure of GDY ensures a tight bond with NiCo 2 S 4 NPs. The maximum rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production is 6682.6 µmol h −1 g −1 over 15% GDY/NiCo 2 S 4 , which is much higher than GDY and NiCo 2 S 4 . The outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen production performance can be attributed to the S‐scheme GDY/NiCo 2 S 4 heterostructure. The fluorescence results demonstrated that the incorporation of GDY significantly enhanced the efficiency of photoelectron‐hole transfer and prolonged the electron lifetime.

The substitution of natural gas (NG) and other fossil feedstocks in SMRs with renewable gases may be considered as an option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This analysis explores process impacts and constraints associated with the potential introduction of biogenic gases into SMRs. The results indicate that replacing NG in the fuel train of the SMR, followed by partial replacement of NG in the feed train may be a feasible approach. For the CO‐ and CO 2 ‐rich gas compositions assumed in this analysis the results indicate that feed train may accommodate up to 25 mole % of biogenic gases using allowances in existing designs and/or with small modifications, while maintaining similar hydrogen output. NG substitution in higher proportions require more major changes because of increased flow rates and heat exchange requirements in the system. Biogenic gases with lower CO 2 and higher calorific values are advantageous for NG substitution, and dry reforming using the CO 2 present in the feed gas can reduce steam consumption and increase process efficiency within limits where coking does not become a new constraint.",

Particularly, synthetic textiles are a severely underutilized waste stream that contains built‐in value stemming from their woven architectures. This work demonstrates a simple upcycling strategy to convert polypropylene‐based (PP) woven fabrics to carbon fiber mats through direct pyrolysis for direct use in various end applications without need of additional processing steps, distinct from prior works converting plastic waste to carbon‐based additives. The retention of material properties and architectures, taking advantage of the inherent value with initial product manufacturing, is investigated, with optimal conditions resulting in consistent high carbon yields. Moreover, the textile‐derived carbon shows exceptional Joule heating performance, which can be employed in various heating applications, resulting in reduced energy consumption compared to conventional heating. Furthermore, decoration of fabric‐derived carbon with metal nanoparticles is demonstrated through electroplating, leading to altered surface functionality and further enhanced Joule heating performance. This work introduces a scalable method for upcycling of plastic waste to functional carbons that can completely retain initial material architectures with controlled shrinkage, providing a viable strategy for generating value‐added products toward electrification of heating processes.",

Engineered nanomaterials used as nanocarriers promise to reduce the volume of agrochemicals required for crop production but concerns about nanocontamination of agricultural products necessitate the discovery of naturally occurring alternatives. Here, plant‐derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) as a “green” alternative to man‐made nanomaterials for the economical delivery of agrochemicals to plants are suggested. Using confocal microscopy and fluorescently labeled CNC, it is demonstrated that CNC can successfully penetrate the plant cell wall and enter cells without causing any negative effects on the overall plant phenotype, genome, and metabolome. The efficiency of CNC to deliver chemicals is demonstrated through in vitro tests involving CNC covalently conjugated with 2,4‐dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4‐D). Plant cell culture experiments confirmed that CNC can be used as a 2,4‐D nanocarrier and reduces the volume of plant growth regulators needed to cultivate plant cells. This work creates a new platform for cyclical agricultural practices where CNC extracted from agricultural waste can be used for the direct delivery of agrochemicals to crops, thereby reducing the environmental burden created by both agricultural waste and excess herbicides.",

Researchers are attempting to rescue this fragile ecosystem through coral restoration actions, and a common step in these procedures is transplanting the new coral colonies into coral reefs. To do that, commercial concrete or epoxy resins, also called putty, are utilized, highlighting different concerns about their mechanical and hardening performances and their impact and fate once released into the environment. Hence, this study presents a new biodegradable epoxidized soybean oil acrylate (ESOA)/zein‐based coral putty capable of quick hardening underwater as an ecofriendly alternative for transplantation of new coral colonies in the reef. Coral putty is composed of two components, containing one a radical initiator and the other a radical accelerator. Once the two components are mixed, coral putty becomes hard underwater in 20–25 min, showing a hardening timescale much faster than other commercial products. The coral putty is biocompatible when applied to the coral Stylophora pistillata in aquaria and Acropora tenuis corals are out‐planted on the reef in the Maldives, demonstrating how this new class of vegetable‐oil‐based materials can be a more sustainable alternative to epoxy resins commonly used in coral restoration procedures.",

To date, commercialized SIBs offer inferior energy density with passable extended cycling. By contrast, next‐generation SIBs will likely utilize layered oxide cathodes that offer improved energy density but to date show inferior stability both during cycling and in terms of stability of the cathodes in air during cell assembly. These properties are highly tunable with composition and herein the promising P2 phases are systematically explored in the Na–Fe–Mn–O phase diagram by making 256 different compositions. The optimal material is a P2 material saturated with Ni (a modest 16% of the transition metal layer) and shows a highly competitive energy density of 640 Wh kg −1 while minimizing the amount of sacrificial sodium needed in full cells and also improving the air stability of the material. This study shows the vital role that thorough systematic screening will play in the continued development of these vital materials for sustainable secondary battery production and provides guidance toward sustainable Na‐ion cathodes by minimizing the nickel content required for high performance.",

In this work, the successful synthesis of uniformly‐sized, spherical Pt–Cu alloy nanodendrites are reported using a novel visible light‐driven photoreduction method that exploits fluorescein as an excited state photosensitizer. Factors influencing the structure and morphology of the PtCu alloy nanodendrites are systematically explored, including pH, Pt 4+ and Cu 2+ concentrations, Pt:Cu molar ratio, Light emitting diode (LED) light irradiation time, light intensity, concentration of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), and concentration of triethylamine (TEA). The experiments reveal a simultaneous photoreduction/galvanic replacement mechanism for PtCu alloy nanodendrite formation. Importantly, the PtCu alloy nanodendrites are easily separable from the reaction solution, facilitating their use as electrocatalysts for the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (eNO 2 RR) to ammonia and also the nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitrate.

In this study, a triboelectric‐electromagnetic hybrid generator of a Ferris‐wheel‐like structure (FWS‐TEHG) with magnetic repulsion assistance is proposed to effectively enhance the collection of low‐frequency and low‐amplitude water wave energy. The Ferris‐wheel shell and the internal rotator are designed with a phase difference to heighten the swing amplitude, while the introduction of magnetic repulsion augments the motion frequency. The device has demonstrated excellent performance in low‐frequency conditions, from laboratory to ocean wave tests. Operating at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and a swing angle of 12° on a six‐freedom platform, it lights up 64 LEDs with a power rating of 2 W. Triggered by simulated water waves with a frequency of 1 Hz, the FWS‐TEHG charges a 19 mF capacitor at an average charging rate of ≈0.58 W h −1 , powering a water‐level alarm. In oceanic conditions, the FWS‐TEHG effectively harvests energy from water waves by exhibiting an output frequency approximately four to five times higher than that of the primary frequency of ocean waves, thus enabling it to power electrical devices such as temperature–humidity meters efficiently. This study provides a valuable reference for advancing the practical application of nanogenerators in natural ocean environments.",

However, it possesses inferior conductivity, which compromises its electrochemical performance in practical applications. To address this challenge, the integration of reduced graphene oxide is explored, renowned for its excellent conductivity, with α‐MnO 2 . This integration enhances the stability and conductivity of the composite structure. The reduction of graphene oxide is achieved through a hydrothermal method, facilitating the wrapping of reduced graphene oxide around α‐MnO 2 nanorods.

In this work, reports on efforts to synthesize and compare SCEs that embedding sulfides (Li 7 PS 6 and Li 3 PS 4 ) into PVDF/HFP polymer using a strong polar solvent (DMF). Two sulfides show distinct behaviors when dispersed in the DMF solvent.

However, this multi‐electron reduction process requires an efficient electrocatalyst to overcome the kinetic barrier. Herein, the Pt 2 Cu 1 nanooctahedrons are synthesized through a liquid‐phase chemical reduction process. The synergistic effect of bimetallic Pt and Cu sites in the Pt 2 Cu 1 nanooctahedrons is indispensable for accelerated NO 2 − hydrogenation, originating from the strong hydrogen‐atoms adsorption capacity at Pt site and the strong NO 2 − adsorption capacity at Cu site. Specifically, the introduction of Pt sites can accelerate the accumulation of hydrogenated species on the catalyst surface, which promotes the formation of NH 3 . In 0.5 m Na 2 SO 4 solution, the Pt 2 Cu 1 nanooctahedrons can reduce NO 2 − to NH 3 at a yield of 4.22 mg h −1 mg cat −1 and a Faraday efficiency of 95.5% at a potential of −0.14 V versus RHE. Meanwhile, the Pt 2 Cu 1 nanooctahedrons also exhibit excellent activity for the sulfion oxidation reaction (SEOR). Using Pt 2 Cu 1 nanooctahedrons as bifunctional electrocatalyst, a coupled electrolysis system combining the nitrite electrochemical reduction reaction (NO 2 − ERR) with the SEOR requires only 0.3 V total voltage, enabling energy‐saving electrochemical NH 3 production and collective value‐added recovery of nitrite and sulfion waste.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Piezocatalysis has emerged as a promising field of research that uses mechanical energy to drive a chemical change. There is growing evidence that piezocatalysts can perform challenging chemical conversions from organic transformations to water splitting. A key challenge to piezocatlaysis is mitigating the inherent high relative permittivity of a ferroelectric material. This high permittivity restricts the transfer of carriers required for a chemical reaction to occur and reduces the reaction rate. Here the concept of producing a co‐catalyst system is taken to enhance carrier mobility increasing the observed reaction rate. The study highlights the importance of determining the sonochemical and piezocatalytic contributions to catalysis. The combination of a Pt metal co‐catalyst with BaTiO 3 through a simple solid‐state method led to a four fold increase in the rate of H 2 production compared to BaTiO 3 and sonochemical reactions in the absence of a catalyst. BaTiO 3 /Pt is found to exhibit stable piezocatalytic performance over 12 h. Where there is a deviation from steady‐state water splitting, it is shown that this is due to mechanical removal of Pt rather than a phase change in the catalyst system. This work confirms the additive benefits of hybrid materials for improving piezocatalytic processes.",

To achieve a future without fossil fuels, the development of high‐efficiency electrocatalysts is necessary, as they directly affect the catalytic performance and overall efficiency of reactions. In addition to the discovery of highly active catalysts, the rapid removal of gaseous products on the electrode surface is equally important for GERs. The adherence of bubbles to the electrode surface introduces substantial resistance, significantly diminishing the system's efficiency. One promising solution to reduce the adhesion of bubbles is the development of electrocatalysts with superaerophobic levels. These surface structures, such as nanotubes, nanosheets, and nanowires, prevent gas bubbles from adhering and promote their rapid removal from the electrode. The aim of this review is first to obtain a deep understanding of mechanisms related to the creation of superaerophobic surfaces, including their characteristics, methods of creation, and bubble detachment behavior. Furthermore, recent advances in the application of these surfaces in various gas‐evolving reactions to enhance electrocatalytic properties are discussed. By taking this innovative approach, valuable insights can be gained into advancing the field of electrocatalysis and driving progress toward sustainable energy solutions.",

Microsupercapacitors (MSCs) are becoming a competitive and advantageous option for these applications.

Vanadium ditelluride (VTe 2 ) stands out as an ideal material platform in this context. Its unique combination of metallic properties and exfoliative characteristics‐stemming from the conducting Te–V–Te layers held together by weak van der Waals interlayer interactions‐ renders it highly promising for high‐performance MSCs. This study is the first to report that the restacking issues and electrochemical performance of VTe 2 can be successfully avoided by the simultaneous incorporation of MXene and CNT to form a ternary hybrid. Here, a laser‐induced graphene (LIG)‐based MSC utilizing VTe 2 /MXene/CNT as the active electrode material is fabricated. This MSC achieve fabrications an outstanding maximum energy density of 6.84 µWh cm −2 and a power density of 304.7 µW cm −2 . This significant achievement demonstrates the potential of this LIG‐based MSC to advance the design of high‐performance micro‐energy storage devices.",

However, the supply chain issues and low electronic conductivity force us to look for alternative options. In this regard, Co‐free binary metal phosphide/phosphate consisting of Ni and V metal (NiVP/Pi) microspheres as the positive electrode of BSH which shows a high specific capacity of 502 C g −1 (1004 F g −1 ) at 2 mV s −1 while retaining a high specific capacity of 214 C g −1 (428 F g −1 ) at 12 A g −1 is reported. The high electronic conductivity of binary metal phosphide in NiVP/Pi electrode and the rich electrochemical active sites due to Ni and V metal centres results in exciting performance. More interestingly, the hybrid device is successfully developed by employing NiVP/Pi as the positive electrode and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the negative electrode. The hybrid device (NiVP/Pi//CNT) is able to achieve a maximum energy density of 22.17 Wh kg −1 and a power density of 5 kW kg −1 with 91.7% capacitance retention after 7500 continuous galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles.",

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X‐ray diffraction (XRD) confirm that MXene nanoplatelets interacted with gelatin through the formation of hydrogen bonds.

Herein, we describe a sustainable and efficient one‐step sonochemical strategy for constructing diverse palladium (II)‐immobilized COFs (Pd(II)/COFs). By merging the sonochemistry‐assisted COF synthesis and in situ Pd (II) immobilization into a single step, this strategy enables the rapid formation of Pd(II)/COF hybrids within an hour under ambient conditions using water as the solvent. Notably, gram‐scale synthesis of Pd(II)/COFs is achievable. The resulting Pd(II)/COFs exhibit superb crystallinity and high surface area, leading to remarkable activity, excellent functionality tolerance, and high recyclability for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross‐coupling reaction of aryl bromides and arylboronic acids at room temperature. This one‐step sonochemical strategy effectively addresses the long‐lasting limitations of traditional multistep synthesis, paving a fast and sustainable avenue to diversified metal/COF hybrids for heterogeneous catalysis and potentially other applications.",

RCFs, derived from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), are developed and further enhanced for flexibility with additives such as glycerol and poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE). The resulting cellulose films display relatively high tensile strength (up to 120 MPa), low Young's Modulus (down to 1500 MPa), and 90% optical transparency. Ink with AgNWs and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as a binder is screen‐printed on regenerated cellulose films. The printed AgNWs patterns exhibit high electrical conductivity, excellent electromechanical performance, and strong interfacial adhesion with RCFs. To demonstrate the application of printed AgNWs on RCFs for soft electronics, transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) are fabricated. Grid and honeycomb structures are printed separately and evaluated in terms of sheet resistance and optical transparency. TCEs with ≈80% transparency and very low sheet resistance (0.045 Ω sq −1 ) are obtained. Furthermore, enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulose substrate and the recovery for reuse of the AgNWs are demonstrated, showing the potential of integrating natural polymers and recyclable nanomaterials for eco‐friendly and sustainable soft flexible electronics.",

Significant efforts have been directed at designing ISSEs with better chemical/electrochemical stability, superior lithium‐ion conductivity, and extensive working voltage windows. However, it has been investigated that Li‐dendrites produced within bulk ISSEs during the charge‐discharge process short‐circuit ASSLM/SBs. Notably, non‐negligble electronic conductivity (σ e ) ≈10 −8 S cm −1 can trigger nucleation of Li‐dendrites at intrinsic defects, e.g., grain boundaries, pores, and cracks of ISSEs, leading to a significant self‐discharge phenomenon in ASSLM/SBs. Furthermore, the reasons behind the insufficient utilization of cathode active materials (CAMs) in ASSLM/SBs at practical current densities or C‐rate remained overlooked. Herein, first, the strategies to reduce the σ e of sulfide‐based SSEs to prevent the Li‐dendrite formation at intrinsic defects are discussed. Second, strategies to enhance sulfur‐based cathodes' ionic and electronic conductivity (CAMs: Li 2 S and S 8 ) are addressed. How a balanced ionic and electronic conductivity in the positive cathode layer realizes fast kinetics and maximizes the utilization of CAMs and reversibility for high‐performance ASSLM/SBs is also discussed. Finally, an extensive conclusion and innovative perspectives are presented to give readers a clearer insight into ASSLM/SBs.",

Perovskite nanosheets are prepared by exfoliating layered perovskite CsCa2Ta3O10 via tetra butyl ammonium ion exchange, followed by liquid ultrasonic exfoliation. The obtained nanosheets exhibits a high specific surface area (>200 m2 g−1). The photocatalytic performance of the resulting reduced perovskite nanosheets is evaluated for CO2 photoreduction under sunlight in the presence of saturated water vapor. The reduced nanosheets exhibit much higher photoactivity than the nonreduced ones. This can be ascribed to their unique structure. The hydrogen treatment in the presence of platinum induces a considerable amount of Ta+4 and oxygen vacancies, which apparently improves the visible light absorption of perovskite nanosheets. Moreover, the introduction of CuO nanoparticles significantly improves the electron–hole separation through the formation of a p–n junction. It also enhances the adsorption of CO2 and stabilizes C1 intermediates which are favorable for CC coupling to form C2 products (e.g., ethanol). The formation rates of ethanol and methanol are 113 and 7.4 µmol g−1 h−1, respectively, while only methanol is obtained at the rate of 125.9 µmol g−1 h−1 in the absence of CuO nanoparticles.",

The porous structure with high content of nitrogen atoms enhances the wettability and accelerates the diffusion of ions inside free‐standing electrodes. These electrodes are fabricated by carbonization of nitrogen‐rich carbon precursors such as polyimide and polyaniline. However, the porous structure and the high degree of nitrogen doping within electrodes are hard to maintain during the carbonization process. Herein, it is demonstrated that a new synthetic approach—nonsolvent‐induced phase separation method—can prepare melamine‐assisted polyimide sheet followed by carbonization process as nitrogen‐rich supercapacitor electrodes with high porosity. A symmetric supercapacitor composed of the above‐mentioned free‐standing electrodes exhibits a specific capacitance of 176 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 (rate capability of 152 A g −1 at 5 A g −1 ) and long lifetime over 10 000 cycles with 99.2% capacitance retention. Also, the supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 6.3 W h kg −1 and power density of 1.25 kW kg −1 . In conclusion the nitrogen‐doped porous carbon sheet improves the energy density of a supercapacitor in comparison to electrodes prepared by conventional methods.",

Millions lack access to clean and safe drinking water, and current trends suggest that billions will face acute water shortages in the coming decades. Development of new materials has led to technological impacts on water purification, from desalination membranes to atmospheric water scavenging. However, the most challenging aspect of technological solutions is cost: if the community being serviced cannot afford the solution, it is not likely to be sustainable. Repurposing Earth‐abundant materials to replace highly engineered solutions is an atractive solution. Herein, minimal processing of bauxite rocks produces a high‐porosity and reactive activated alumina in situ, without purification directly from the ore. This acid‐treated, thermally activated bauxite (ATAB) exhibits a high surface area of 401 ± 6 m 2 g −1 , a 40‐fold increase relative to its parent ore, and a 2× increase relative to the state‐of‐the‐art fluoride adsorbent, activated alumina. The composition, preparation, and mechanism of adsorption are studied by X‐ray diffraction, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and multiple‐quantum magic‐angle spinning 27 Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The maximum adsorption density of ATAB is comparable with that of activated alumina, but ATAB requires fewer processing steps, thus warranting future consideration as a primary adsorbent of choice for fluoride removal from water.",

BaSnO 3 shows excellent performance in collecting and transferring photogenerated electrons from g‐C 3 N 4 to reactive sites, thus effectively inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electron–holes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar desalination technology is regarded as a low‐carbon and environment‐friendly technology to address the water crisis. The current challenge is that sunlight irradiates directly the entire water body, resulting in a low photothermal conversion efficiency. Herein, a novel photothermal compound material with dual‐layer structure for solar‐steam‐generation is developed by depositing multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and carbon black nanoparticles (CB) onto a biomass reed straw (RS) skeleton. With respect to the lower layer of the resultant generator, the porous RS skeleton with open‐cell vessel channels and closed‐cell porous basic tissues can not only supply the water to the upper layer through the capillary force, but also insulate the heat transport. Additionally, the MWCNTs‐CB hybrid photothermal composite on the upper layer with large specific surface and roughness facilitates the evaporation of water by the generated heat from the absorbed solar light. The composite generator possesses an extremely high spectral absorption of ≈99% in wet state, along with a superb evaporation rate of ≈1.45 kg m −2 h −1 and photothermal conversion efficiency of ≈87.58% under one sunlight irradiation. Thus, the deposition of MWCNTs‐CB on a renewable biomass RS skeleton develops an ideal candidate generator that hold a desirable promise for applications in seawater desalination.",

The extent of disassembly is superior to the corresponding HCl‐induced pH change, suggesting that organic acids directly hamper non‐covalent interactions involving lignin components and ferric ions. This disassembly coincides with the facilitated co‐release of crop nutrients (i.e., ferric ions) and stimulants (i.e., lignin components) in a time‐dependent manner. The resulting exposed core HAs are further surface‐engineered with organic acids, thus accelerating the release of crop nutrients (i.e., calcium and phosphate ions) through the particle dissolution. Finally, lignin‐Fe‐coated HAs significantly enhances Zea mays growth rates under heat and salt stress compared to bare ones, suggesting that the increased organic acid secretion by the roots under abiotic stresses accelerates the disassembly and subsequent dissolution of the coated particles. Given that conventional rhizosphere‐responsive fertilizers are mainly based on H + ion‐mediated structural changes, the approach provides a more effective means to detect the rhizosphere and crop stress state by exploiting the nature‐inspired relationship between small organic acids and supramolecular polyphenolic assemblies.",

This method is based on the in situ incorporation of an amino acid, l ‐tyrosine, during the synthesis of the titanias owing to its coordination and co‐condensation with the titania precursor under acidic conditions. This methodology allows the fine ‐tuning of their crystalline structure, size, and shape by simply varying the pH of the synthesis gel, leading to anatase nanoparticles of ≈5 nm and surface areas of ≈200 m 2 g −1 at pH = 2.2, while highly crystalline rutile nanorods are formed at pH = 0. The incorporation of l ‐tyrosine to both anatase nanoparticles and rutile nanorods enables these materials to absorb light in the visible range due to both the decrease in their band gap, as compared to the reference materials, and the presence of additional absorption edges at wavelengths higher than 400 nm. Consequently, the photocatalytic activity of both hybrid anatase nanoparticles and rutile nanorods exhibits a 120% enhanced photocatalytic efficiency, as compared to that of l ‐Tyr‐free titanias and the commercial P25, which confirms their potential application in water remediation.",

Under the principles of doping and interface engineering, a Ag/PW 12 /Zr‐ m TiO 2 composite is fabricated in a one‐pot synthesis, where zirconium‐doped mesoporous TiO 2 is co‐decorated with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs, optimal 1 wt%) and phosphotungstic acid (PW 12 , optimal 10 wt%). Enhanced nitrogen chemisorption is achieved owing to Zr‐doping, where the mesoporous structure of Zr‐ m TiO 2 favors nitrogen mass transfer. Ag NPs decoration leads to visible light absorption. At the interface, PW 12 and Ag NPs decelerate the recombination of photo‐generated charge carriers. A Z‐scheme mechanism is suggested for the hetero‐junction, and the surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag NPs is considered in the composite. Consequently, a NH 3 /NH 4 + production rate of 324.2 µ mol g cat −1 h −1 is achieved in the photo‐driven process, together with the structure‐reactivity relationship between transient photocurrent intensity and catalytic efficiency. Moreover, constructing Ag/PW 12 /Zr‐ m TiO 2 heterojunction introduces a plentitude of active sites for the electrochemical process, together with enhanced charge transfer efficiency at the interface. Hence, an excellent NH 3 /NH 4 + production rate of 55.0 µ g mg cat −1 h −1 is accomplished at −0.6 V vs RHE.

Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of high porosity and specific surface area, and MOF materials can be ideal carriers for single atoms, which can be anchored from a monoatomic dispersion of metal atoms by simple pyrolysis. Moreover, single atoms derived from MOF materials have high structural order, allowing them to be modeled using theoretical computational models to enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of SACs. SAC synthesis methods and applications in various fields are reviewed. Finally, the catalytic processes of SACs in the context of theoretical calculations are reviewed.",

Here, a facile and eco‐friendly strategy is proposed to fabricate a lamellar wood‐derived carbon framework with excellent electrical conductivity for stretchable strain sensors. The obtained carbonized delignified wood framework (CDWF) possesses higher conductivity (5.62 S cm −1 ), and larger specific surface area (35.42 m 2 g −1 ) as compared with carbonized wood framework (CWF). Moreover, the CDWF can be utilized to assemble a stretchable strain sensor by encapsulating it into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The CDWF‐based sensor exhibits favorable stretchability, stability, and durability (5000 cycles). The outstanding sensing properties of the sensors enable it to measure the joint movement of the human body accurately and continuously, showing good prospects for human physical monitoring and wearable devices applications.",

The pore volume that is available for oil uptake amounts to 85–90% of the total volume of the sorbent. When it is introduced to a crude oil–water mixture, the sorbent selectively absorbs the oil instantaneously. The gelator in the shell congeals the oil in the shell matrix, forming a rigid enclosure for the absorbed oil and this allows the collection of the oil‐absorbed sorbents without dripping. The absorbed oil can be recovered quantitatively by simple pressing. The method is general and works with all kinds of crude oils.

The small‐pores at bottom regions enable capillary pumping capability, while the large‐pores at the top regions strengthen light capture and facilitate water/vapor transport.

In this direction, a new class of carbon‐free electrocatalysts for ORR is prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles on ZrP (Zirconium phosphates) nanoplates.

Paper straws, as an alternative have limitations such as weak mechanical properties, poor water stability, and the use of coatings or adhesives that hinder their biodegradability. The present study reports a facile approach for preparing mechanically robust, water‐stable, and biodegradable straws using partially delignified and microwave (MW) treated bamboo. The MW‐processed bamboo‐based straws present water stability for up to 16 h and a contact angle of 87.8°, suggesting low wettability and water stability for long periods. The processed straws show improved tensile strength of 59.3 MPa, Young's modulus of 988 MPa, and a flexural strength of 13.9 MPa, along with &gt;97% biodegradation (98 days). MW treatment is a rapid and low‐cost strategy for physiochemical modification that can be used for the large‐scale production of drinking straws from biomass. The life cycle analysis (LCA) shows that MW‐irradiated bamboo straws generate 86.53% less global warming potential (GWP) impact during production and 91.8% less human health damage impact during end‐of‐life (EOL), compared to plastic straws. MW‐treated drinking straws from bamboo can thus become a low‐cost, eco‐friendly, biodegradable, and sustainable alternative to paper and plastic straws.",

Unfortunately, its intrinsic low electronic conductivity significantly hinders the release of specific capacity and rate capability, preventing its practical application. Herein, a carbon layer with dual conductive networks connected by chain‐like Ketjen black (KB) is built on the surface of Na 4 MnCr(PO 4 ) 3 material. This novel Na 4 MnCr(PO 4 ) 3 /C@KB composite material exhibits improved rate capability of 61.2 mAh g −1 at 2 C compared to 19.5 mAh g −1 of Na 4 MnCr(PO 4 ) 3 /C and high reversible capacity of 88.0 mAh g −1 at 1 C with 73% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be ascribed to an increase of electronic conductivity enabled by the dual conductive 3D network construction and an adequate infiltration of electrolyte by substantial pores existence in carbon layer. A promising dual conductive network design strategy is demonstrated here for improving the performance of NASICON‐structured cathodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wastewater pollution with organic compounds poses a serious threat to human health. One of the possible methods for solving these problems can be the use of micro/nanomotors. Among them, manganese‐based micro/nanomotors have a number of important advantages related to high catalytic activity, powerful motion, and low cost. Due to their mobility, micro/nanomotors promote an increase in the intensity of mass transfer in the reacting system. When introducing ferromagnetic elements into manganese‐based micro/nanomotors, it is possible not only to increase their motion speed, but also to make their motion more controllable. Herein, for the first time it demonstrates a synthesis method for MnFe 2 O 4 @ Fe 3 O 4 / graphite and Mn 2 O 3 @ Fe 2 O 3 @ Fe 3 O 4 / graphite magnetic catalytic micromotors, which have remarkable photocatalytic properties. Micromotors are clusters of nanoparticles whose motion in a hydrogen peroxide solution in a non‐uniform magnetic field is caused by the action of magnetic force and self‐diffusiophoresis. Nanoparticles are synthesized by the plasma‐arc method with subsequent annealing in the air. When changing the annealing temperature, the catalytic and magnetic properties of nanoparticles can vary within a wide range of values. Micromotors MnFe 2 O 4 @ Fe 3 O 4 / graphite have the most optimal catalytic and magnetic properties. The results of the research show that these micromotors are effective catalysts in the decomposition of methylene blue.",

The room temperature hydride is an interstitial alloy, which is selected for its capacity to absorb and desorb hydrogen over an appropriate range of temperature and pressure. The static tests aim to assess whether the requirements for hydrogen release are reliably met by the tank setup. Hypothetical on‐road tests have been designed and applied. Dynamic tests allow moving from energy to power density. Solutions are adopted to face the issues of thermal management at higher‐demanding performances. Several cycles have been performed to find the ideal settings to preserve high average and peak gas flow in a realistic situation. The use of a metal hydride, to replace pressurized gas, results in improved performances, including an extended range at lower loading pressures. Decreasing the pressure in the storage system enables the advantageous possibility to reload the tank several times with commercially available cylinders. Possible future enhancements in the reduction of the total weight of the system are also considered.",

If the nanoparticles are self‐aligned unidirectionally and closely to each other, stress‐induced charges can be generated even with a tiny stimulus with no or less energy loss due to the stress‐sensitive geometric structure and more shortened energy transfer pathways. Herein, a facile electrical orientation method is reported to obtain vertically aligned spherical cubic‐phase BaTiO 3 nanoparticle arrays in a polymer matrix for the enhanced piezoelectric power generation. It is observed that the (200) diffraction plane of cubic‐phase BaTiO 3 is transformed by an electric field to generate piezoelectric performance. Compared with the randomly dispersed nanoparticle composite, the vertically aligned BaTiO 3 array film has excellent electrical output performance (≈3 V and 650 nA) and more than twice the transparency because of reducing light scattering by gathering BaTiO 3 nanoparticles. Additionally, it is demonstrated that electric charge generated by a mechanical microloading of 4 µ m denting depth using a nanoindenter equipment can pass through the polymer insulating layer in the well‐aligned composite system but not the dispersed system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the quest for solutions to enhance the safety and sustainability of energy storage devices, Bombyx mori silkworm cocoons are proposed as separators for lithium (Li)‐ion batteries obtained literally from nature, and employed directly in a device. The suitability of the cocoons is evaluated in Li‐ion batteries using two different electrolytes: a mixture of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6 ), ethylene carbonate (EC), and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and the ionic liquid (IL) 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Emim]TFSI). Li/C–LiFePO 4 half cells comprising the EC–DMC–LiPF 6 electrolyte present excellent cycling performance, with a discharge capacity up to 86 mAh g −1 and a capacity retention up to 81% after 50 cycles at C rate. Values of 66 mAh g −1 at C /5 and 85% result with [Emim]TFSI, respectively. Separator/electrolyte interactions during battery cycling lead to a decrease of the degree of crystallinity of the cocoon silk fibers, and, in the presence of EC–DMC–LiPF 6 , to a concomitant increase of the concentration of free PF 6 − ions. The self‐extinguishing ability of silkworm cocoons represents an additional benefit to batteries, providing fire risk reduction or even suppression. This bio‐inspired work paves the way toward the fabrication of environmentally friendlier separators for next‐generation sustainable and safer Li‐ion batteries.",

The numerous positive charges on the nanoparticles facilitate adsorption of the dyes, and Ru‐catalyzed photolysis, promoted by the hydrophobic environment of the nanoparticles, leads to their degradation.

It starts with mechanically grinding, and then oxidizing the CNTs by hydroxyl radicals in sealed reactors. Such processed CNTs are shorter, possess balanced surface oxygen containing groups without compromising the original CNT integrity, and can disperse readily in water.

The optical and electrical losses inherent in the construction of multijunction cells are analyzed using information from thin‐film silicon photovoltaics as a representative case. Although the multijunction approach generally reduces the thermalization and nonabsorption losses, several types of losses rise with the number of subcells. Optical reflection and parasitic absorption are slightly increased by adding supporting layers and interfaces. The output voltages decline because of the tunnel recombination junctions, and more importantly of the illumination filtered and reduced by the top subcell(s). The loss mechanisms consume the potential gains in efficiency of multijunction cells. For thin‐film silicon, the triple‐junction is confirmed to be the best performing structure. More generally, only when each component subcell shows a high ratio between the output voltage and the bandgap of the absorber material, a multijunction cell with a large number of subcells can be beneficial. Finally, the high voltage and low current density of multijunction cells with a large number of subcells make them difficult to optimize and manufacture, vulnerable to any changes in the solar spectrum, and thus less practical for the ordinary terrestrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Perovskite solar cells have attained incredible power conversion efficiencies but it is still unclear whether photogenerated carriers are free or excitonic in nature. Originally, it is believed that they are exciton‐based devices, similar to organic or dye‐sensitized solar cells. However, the emergence of efficient planar devices as well as measurements of exciton binding energy in the range of 10–100 meV suggest that they may be free carrier‐based. In this work, the free carrier model is confirmed by building graphene/perovskite Schottky barrier solar cells, analogous to conventional metal/semiconductor Schottky barrier solar cells. To address the challenges of building such devices, solution‐processing techniques are extensively investigated for depositing perovskite films directly onto graphene in order to obtain an intimate contact between the graphene and perovskite. Interestingly, these graphene/perovskite Schottky barrier devices have reasonably good efficiency—up to 10.6%—and short circuit current densities only slightly lower than control devices. Furthermore, devices with neither a hole transport layer nor an electron transport layers have power conversion efficiencies of up to 6%. These results provide convincing evidence supporting the free carrier model for methylammonium lead iodide perovskites and offer insights on potential alternative designs for perovskite solar cells.",

However, the sulfur‐based cathode in RT‐NaS always undergoes dissolution of polysulfides during the cycle, which limits the utilization of active material and the stability of the RT‐NaS. In this study, the authors report an economical and simple method to suppress the dissolution of polysulfides by forming an artificial protective solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the cathode surface using an in situ electrochemical treatment with a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) electrolyte additive. The artificially formed SEI has a thickness of ≈20 nm and contains fluoride anions that improve electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. The RT‐NaS full cell with the sulfur–carbon cathode and protective SEI exhibits a 0.1 V Na+/Na lower electrochemical polarization for desodiation, and SEI and electrical resistances that are 23% and 45% lower, respectively, than those of untreated NaS. These improvements lead to a capacity increase of ≈120% (270 to 590 mAh g −1 at the 50th cycle) and a high Coloumbic efficiency of 99.5% in the high‐rate cyclability test of the 2 C rate over 200 cycles.",

The results show that the streaming voltage and current are induced from the water‐drop flow across the surface of FPNG, such as rainwater.

Then, the streaming voltage and current produced from dropping rainwater onto the FPNG are investigated and the power is 2.4 ± 0.65 pW per droplet. It is assumed that there are abundant pores and oxygen‐containing functional groups on the surface of filter papers with overlapped and crosslinked morphology, providing vast active sites and ion diffusion channels to enhance the electric double layer capacitance.

Under optimized conditions, the sensor shows excellent sensitivities for Hg 2+ with LDRs of 1 n m –1 µ m and 0.1–1 m m . In addition to this, the limit of detection of the sensor toward Hg 2+ is 0.0798 n m or 79.8 p m , which is well below the guideline value recommended by the World Health Organization. The sensor exhibits excellent selectivity for Hg 2+ against other heavy metal ions including Cu 2+ , Fe 3+ , Ni 2+ , Pb 2+ , Cr 3+ , K + , Na + , Ag + , Sn 2+ , and Cd 2+ . The thus‐obtained excellent sensitivity and selectivity with wide LDRs can be attributed to the high conductivity, large surface area microflower structured 1T‐WS 2 , and the complexation of Hg 2+ ions with S 2− . In addition to good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability, this sensor shows the practical feasibility of Hg 2+ detection in tap water suggesting a promising device for real applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solid‐state electrolytes can alleviate the safety issues of electrochemical energy systems related to chemical and thermal instabilities of liquid electrolytes. While a liquid provides seamless ionic transport with almost perfect wettability between electrodes, a solid‐state electrolyte needs to demonstrate at least comparable electrochemical performance to liquid electrolytes as well as mechanical robustness and flexibility. Here, the facile preparation of montmorillonite (MMT)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) nanocomposites is reported, which show high ionic conductivities, mechanical strengths, and thermal stabilities by forming nacre‐mimetic “brick‐and‐mortar” structures. The molecularly confined structures of DMSO are confirmed by X‐ray diffraction peaks with d ‐spacings of interplanar spacing that are slightly larger than MMTs. The MMT/DMSO composites have mechanical strengths and toughnesses of 55.3 ± 4.8 MPa and 210.2 ± 32.6 kJ m −2 , respectively. The ionic conductivity is ≈2 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at room temperature, and their thermal stability is in the range of −100 to 120 °C. The optical translucency, on‐demand eco‐degradability, and solution processability together make the MMT/DMSO composites unique materials with a wide range of solid‐state electrochemical applications including batteries.",

Nonetheless, lignin, one of its major components, is largely underutilized and only considered an undesired byproduct. Through catalytic hydrotreatment, the highly condensed lignin can be partially depolymerized into a range of monomers. However, its recalcitrance and the presence of aromatic fragments linked by CC bonds require extensive cracking, which is challenging to achieve. Here, a two‐step strategy is reported in which an initial pretreatment step with ozone is used prior to catalytic hydrotreatment to boost lignin depolymerization. Three types of lignin (Kraft, pyrolytic, and Fabiola organosolv) are used as feedstocks and the ozonation step is performed under ambient conditions with either methanol or ethanol as the solvent. The pretreatment is shown to have a positive effect on the subsequent hydrotreatment reaction (Pd/C, 350 °C, 100 bar H 2 ) and gives product oils with significantly lower M w (up to 43% lower), higher volatility, and improved calorific values (up to 45.3 MJ kg −1 ) compared to a direct hydrotreatment.",

Combining the precision and proficiency of biomolecules to signal the presence of low‐level toxins is key to developing water system monitoring that enables fast detection and remediation of pollution. Here, a 3D flow sensor is developed incorporating enzymes which can signal the presence of organic toxins from water systems over extended periods of time. The enzymes are encapsulated in a porous, crystalline metal–organic framework (MOF) cage, providing protection and stability. The inline flow device features a cutting‐edge 3D‐printed design to maximize flow and interfacial interactions between the encapsulated organophosphate degrading enzyme (OpdA) and the organophosphate based pollutants. The OpdA produces a yellow product on decomposition of the pollution that signals its presence. The porous protective MOF coating is key to this technology, structurally securing the enzyme while allowing the flow of reactant and thus the continuous breakdown of organic pollution over several days.",

To produce truly integrative outcomes, this paper provides insight into the system as a whole, its components and the relationships between them, using specific tools, to form the basis for a circular strategy. A toolbox is presented for transforming the current linear and fragmented waste management processes into integrative and circular strategies. The proposed integrative methodology encompassing outline, multipillar mapping, and synthesis can be applied to different locations and waste streams.

    "abstract": "Abstract Herein, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreatment of lignocellulose is performed to investigate the structural evolution of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. It is found that most of hemicellulose and part of cellulose are hydrolyzed/converted to monosaccharide, alcohols, and carboxylic acids. Over half of cellulose is stabilized because the reducing end groups of cellulose convert to stable carboxylic groups. In addition, lignin is converted to aromatic monomers (predominately vanillin and acetovanillone) with a highest yield of 6.1 wt%, along with dimers and oligomers with M w less than 10 000 Da. According to heteronuclear single quantum coherence analysis, no common interlinkages (β‐O‐4, β‐β, β‐5, etc.) appear in lignin oligomers due to lignin fragments condensed during the alkaline pretreatment. Notably, the acidification process is also the cause of lignin condensation since high aromatic monomers yield of 15 wt% (based on original lignin in pine) is achieved by a postoxidation of alkaline solution, while few no aromatic monomers generated by using the isolated lignin oligomers. The direct oxidation of lignocellulose in alkaline solutions to aromatic monomers demonstrates the potential application of lignocellulose alkaline pretreatment for high‐value chemicals production.",

All constituents, including the redox‐active material and conductive carbon additive, are made from renewable resources. Using a simple, sustainable fabrication method, a hybrid material is formed. The low cost and ecofriendly material shows outstanding performance with a capacity of 108 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 and low capacity fading, retaining approximately 80% of the maximum capacity after 90 cycles. With approximately 3.4 V versus Li + /Li, the cells also feature one of the highest reversible redox potentials reported for biomolecular cathodes. Finally, the quinone‐catecholate redox mechanism responsible for the high capacity of tannic acid is confirmed by electrochemical characterization of a model compound similar to tannic acid but without catecholic groups.",

The hybrid NG can charge a lithium battery to 2.9 V in 8 h. Furthermore, the charged battery can be employed to drive an IR remote controlled light‐emitting diode lamp and turn the lamp on and off. In addition, it can be combined with a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) temperature sensor to form a self‐powered BLE temperature detection system.

The nanoparticles demonstrate high performance for photocatalytic water splitting and photodecomposition of organic material. To this end bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide ([Tf 2 N] − )‐based ILs with cations of different properties with respect to specific interactions with the target material are investigated. Isolated, 15 ± 1 nm sized nano‐spheres of SrTiO 3 are observed to form in [C 3 mimOH][Tf 2 N] ([C 3 mimOH] + = 1‐(3‐hydroxypropyl)‐3‐methylimidazolium).

Here, spatially resolved, in situ nano‐X‐ray fluorescence microscopy is applied to directly observe nanometer‐scale dissolution, morphological, and chemical evolution of individual and aggregated ZnO nanorods in complex “real‐world” conditions: influent water and primary sludge collected from a municipal wastewater system. A complete transformation of isolated ZnO nanorods into ZnS occurs after only 1 hour in influent water, but larger aggregates of the ZnO nanorods transform only partially, with small contributions of ZnS and Zn‐phosphate (Zn 3 (PO 4 ) 2 ) species, after 3 hours. Transformation of aggregates of the ZnO nanorods toward mixed ZnS, Zn adsorbed to Fe‐oxyhydroxides, and a large contribution of Zn 3 (PO 4 ) 2 phases are observed during their incubation in primary sludge for 3 hours. Discrete, isolated ZnO regions are imaged with unprecedented spatial resolution, revealing their incipient transformation toward Zn 3 (PO 4 ) 2 . Passivation by transformation(s) into mixtures of less soluble phases may influence the subsequent bioreactivity of these nanomaterials. This work emphasizes the importance of imaging the nanoscale chemistry of mixtures of nanoparticles in highly complex, heterogeneous semi‐solid matrices for improved prediction of their impacts on treatment processes, and potential environmental toxicity following release.",

Most studies of photocatalysis have focused on the photocatalyst efficiency toward pollutant degradation, but the detailed mechanisms of charge separation as well as transfer and photocatalytic acetone oxidation pathways are not revealed clearly. In this work, it is found that hafnium metal doping on the n‐type semiconductor SnO 2 can modify the electronic structures, restrain the recombination of electron–hole pairs, where the hafnium metal ion acts as the activation site, leading to improved oxidation ability to realize efficient acetone degradation. In addition, the specific path toward the acetone degradation is revealed by closely combined active radical detection, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and theoretical calculation methods. It provides a new perspective about the detailed and comprehensive reaction mechanism of photocatalytic acetone degradation and carriers transfer between pollutants and photocatalysts, which is expected to promote the practical usage of photocatalytic technology for the expeditious removal VOCs.",

In contrast to the current progress mainly from side functional group modification, here a simple and effective strategy is reported to effectively regulate the aggregation of P3CT‐K through the modification of the thiophene units in the main chain. A small molecule tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPB) is applied as the Lewis acid to interact with the thiophene unit of polythiophene chain and regulate the aggregation of conjugated polyelectrolytes. The control of aggregation of P3CT‐K not only elevates the hole mobility of P3CT‐K, but also suppresses charge recombination in P3CT‐K composite films. Consequently, the high efficiency of inverted MAPbI 3 perovskite solar cells is achieved with a peak power conversion efficiency of 20.7% and simultaneously improved short‐circuit current density and fill factor.

Here, a novel design strategy for improving the catalytic activity of PGM‐free catalysts by adopting N‐doped large‐porous carbon as a support material is reported. This paper shows the effect of support on the activity of non‐noble NiMo in HOR by comparing NiMo alloy on N‐doped mesocellular carbon foam (NiMo/N‐MSUF‐C) with NiMo/MSUF‐C and NiMo on N‐doped CMK‐3 (NiMo/N‐CMK‐3). The strong interaction between NiMo and N species in N‐MSUF‐C alters the electronic structure of NiMo toward optimal binding energies for H and OH. The large pores in N‐MSUF‐C facilitate the diffusion of OH − into the catalyst layer, thereby increasing the limiting current density, which is higher compared with that of NiMo/N‐CMK‐3. The AEMFC with NiMo/N‐MSUF‐C as the anode shows a higher peak power density of 152 mW cm −2 in H 2 /O 2 compared with that of previously reported PGM‐free catalysts. These results can lead to efficient designing of highly effective AEMFCs for practical applications.",

These agricultural practices, in conjunction with various natural factors, have led to the contamination of water bodies. Preserving contamination‐free hydrographic basins is a challenge and a priority of the community. This article first presents a classification of the various pesticides, the existing regulations concerning their use, and their influence on the aquatic environment. Several methodologies for the removal of pesticides from aqueous media are presented, with emphasis on adsorption techniques. In addition, a discussion is provided for materials with nanoscale characteristics as promising adsorbents of pesticides present in water. A focus on research regarding nanostructured hybrid biopolymeric materials is proposed, with critical appraisal and future perspectives. Factors such as the ability to recover, regenerate, and reuse these hybrids, together with their environmentally friendly characteristics, make them highly attractive options for the proposed purpose. However, their current application in the treatment of pesticide‐contaminated water remains low. This new generation of biopolymeric nanocomposite hybrid materials emerges as a viable, cost‐effective, and eco‐friendly option for use in the provision of safe water to society.",

For this purpose, partially amorphous CoNi 2 S 4 nanosheets grown directly on nickel foam (PA‐CoNi 2 S 4 /NF) are successfully synthesized via a facile solvothermal method combined with follow‐up KBH 4 treating. The nanosheets structure optimizes the ion transport path and the amorphous crystals endow PA‐CoNi 2 S 4 /NF with numerous sulfur vacancies. Therefore, the as‐prepared PA‐CoNi 2 S 4 /NF possess high specific capacitance (3305 F g –1 at 2 A g –1 ) and excellent capacitance retention of 66.4% when the current density increases from 2 to 100 A g –1 . In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor device composed of PA‐CoNi 2 S 4 /NF as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode exhibits a high energy density of 43.4 Wh kg –1 at a power density of 800.4 W kg –1 , as well as excellent long‐term cyclic stability. This work offers a simple approach for the fabrication of transition metal sulfide materials with high electrochemical activities in SCs and other electrochemical energy‐related fields.",

Herein, 3D printing of a cellulose‐based aerogel is achieved by direct ink writing based on a self‐thickening and self‐strengthening strategy, followed by freezing drying. The magnetic cellulose‐based aerogels (MCAs) containing Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles are ideal adsorbents for adsorbing and removing organic pollutants from water. As catchers and carriers for magnetic removal, MCAs (Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and cellulose) provide large active sites, which allows organic pollution to be quickly and stably bound on the surface. The adsorption effect of methylene blue (MB) is dependent on pH and the removal efficiency of MB (5.6 mg l ‐1 , pH = 9) is 88.5% for MCA, which occurs almost instantaneously at room temperature. In addition, the collected aerogel‐MB hybrid can be reactivated by acid‐washing (pH = 3) without obvious changes in the adsorption performance of MCA. The MCA exhibits a fast, efficient and sustainable removal of organic pollutants, which provides an inexpensive and recyclable method for water remediation.",

This allows the preparation of the target ketal directly from LA and avoiding intermediate esterification steps of LA to levulinate esters to minimize the formation of unwanted side products. The catalytic activity of UiO‐66 is found to depend critically on the hydration degree of the solid and the amount of missing linker defects. The most likely active sites for ketalization in (defective) UiO‐66 are Brønsted‐induced acid sites arising from the strong coordination and polarization of H 2 O molecules onto accessible Zr 4+ associated with missing linker defects. A progressive deactivation is observed upon catalytic reuse, which is attributed to adsorbed reaction products poisoning the catalytic sites. These adsorbed products are easily removed by washing the spent catalyst with a dilute 2% HCl ethanolic solution, which completely restores the initial catalytic activity while maintaining the crystallinity of the solid intact.",

Herein, highly dispersed Ni sites are planted on C 3 N 5 , an N‐rich carbon nitride, by a facial two‐step annealing method to construct a Ni‐C 3 N 5 material. The incorporation of Ni sites can significantly enhance the e – /h + separation efficiency of C 3 N 5 under light irradiation and promote the activation of O 2 to produce reactive oxygen species. Compared with pristine C 3 N 5 (with NO removal ratio of ≈35%), the as‐prepared 0.1‐ or 0.25‐Ni‐C 3 N 5 material can remove ≈54% continuous‐flowing NO (initial concentration: 600 ppb) quickly in less than 25 min under white LED light irradiation. The long‐term photocatalytic performance demonstrates that the catalyst is stable without obvious attenuation in activity. The findings of the trapping experiments and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy tests suggest that • O 2 − may mainly convert NO into NO 2 , while • OH and 1 O 2 play a significant role in the NO 2 to NO 3 – conversion reaction.

The considered processes involve two options: gas and aqueous phase furfural oxidation with oxygen (air) and hydrogen peroxide as oxidants, respectively, considered as sustainable technologies because of the use of renewable feedstock. Conventional routes, used as benchmarks, include the current production processes using benzene or butane as raw materials. The results show that the aqueous phase process is far from being viable from an energy and environmental point of view due to the high exergy destruction and the use of H 2 O 2 as oxidant (whose production entails important environmental drawbacks). On the contrary, the gas phase oxidation of furfural shows competitive results with petrochemical technologies. Nevertheless, the major environmental drawback of the new furfural‐to‐maleic anhydride production processes is detected on the environmental profile of the starting raw material. The results suggest that a better environmental footprint for maleic anhydride production in gas phase can be obtained if environmentally friendly furfural production technologies are used at the commercial scale.",

The vegetable waste microparticles are found to be homogenously dispersed within the PPC matrix. Due to the establishment of a strong intermolecular hydrogen bond network between PPC and vegetable waste microparticles, the obtained biocomposites exhibit improved mechanical properties compared to pure PPC, comparable to these of common plastics use for packaging materials. The water barrier properties of the developed biocomposites are also promising for packaging applications. Additionally, the developed biocomposites are found to be biocompatible and show effective antioxidant scavenging activity against 2,2′‐azinobis(3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS •+ ).

The emissions associated to the proposed approaches vary between 0.12 and 0.22 kg CO 2 equiv. per kg PC , while the operational costs range from 3 to 8 $ per t PC .

Employing this solvent‐free approach allows to minimize the ecological impact of the synthesis by bypassing hazardous wastes, while simultaneously observing the reactions between the individual starting materials separately for the first time. Especially the role of dichloromethane needs to be reconsidered, functioning as a linker between the nitrogen‐containing node cyanuric chloride and the aromatic monomer 1,3,5‐triphenylbenzene, as proven by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and 1 H → 13 C Cross‐Polarization magic‐angle‐spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This results in a drastic enhancement of the reaction rate, reducing the synthesis time down to 1 minute. Additionally, this linkage over a C1 bridge enables the incorporation of nitrogen into already synthesized polymers by post polymerization functionalization. The variation of the synthesis building blocks, namely the linker, node, and monomer, results in a variety of nitrogen‐containing polymers with specific surface areas of up to 1500 m 2 g −1 . Therefore, the presented approach is capable to target the synthesis of various CTNs with a minimal use of chlorinated linker, rendering the concept as a sustainable alternative to the classical solution‐based synthesis.",

The current research strategies are focused on improving heat and mass transfer using different supporting materials to achieve mechanical integrity during storage. However, these strategies are still under development, and they have not overcome the lab scale yet. This work explores novel matrices to expand the material database for TCES composites. Pure structural matrices (cellulose) and novel matrices with storage potential (polymeric solid–solid phase change materials) are selected and combined with three well‐known thermochemical materials (TCMs) (MgSO 4 ·6H 2 O, SrBr 2 ·6H 2 O and MgCl 2 ·6H 2 O), providing evidence of hybridized composites with storage capacity up to 2.4 GJ m −3 with a 25–20 wt% of polymeric matrix. The polymer content is found to act as a nucleating agent in the magnesium sulfate crystallization process forming a synthetic monohydrate crystalline phase (Kieserite) and inhibiting the formation of the amorphous phase. The effect of the matrix is proved to induce certain structural deformation or changes not observed in the pure TCM sorption process. This phenomenon has the potential to benefit the stabilization of the TCM, e.g., inhibition of the formation of amorphous phase in magnesium sulfate composites.",

However, greenhouse operation is energy intensive due to their heating and cooling loads. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are promising for semitransparent greenhouse roofs that produce clean electricity, thus reducing the greenhouse energy demand, while also transmitting enough light to satisfy plant growth. Herein, we model the performance of LSC roofs designed as glass panels coated with quantum dot (QD)/polymer nanocomposite films and front‐facing surface‐mounted photovolatic cells. Five widely studied QD materials are examined to demonstrate that the proposed QD LSC roofs can have effective power conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% while also increasing the red‐light fraction, which is beneficial for plant growth. The effect of LSC integration on the greenhouse thermal energy demands is studied for the example of silicon (Si) QD LSC roofs. In warm climates, solar power generated by the Si QD LSC roofs satisfies the entire greenhouse energy demand and thus enables net‐zero energy operation. Overall, the results of the current research demonstrate the strong potential of integrating QD LSCs into greenhouses to reduce energy costs and enhance plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) devices are exemplar systems for mechanical‐to‐electrical energy conversion due to their simplicity and promising performance. However, little attention has been paid to recycling or reusing TENG devices. Indeed, most TENG devices are based on non‐biodegradable polymers, and thus end up in a landfill. Developing biodegradable triboelectric materials is crucial to mitigate negative environmental impacts from their growing use, however, it is challenging to identify such a materials that generate an applicable charge. Herein, such a biodegradable polymer triboelectric pair is demonstrated, by combining poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) films with microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) filler. A power density of 143 mW m −2 and a charge density of 1.36 nC cm −2 is measured when contacting pristine PBS with 70 wt% MCC/PBS composite film, which is comparable to polydimethylsiloxane‐based TENGs under identical testing conditions. These devices are shown to degrade via composting at 58 °C over 70 days, enabling long‐term (&gt;10 000 cycle) performance and degradation upon disposal. It is suggested that this approach can be extended to control triboelectric properties for other biodegradable polymers. The technology and concepts developed herein directly address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for Responsible Consumption &amp; Production and Affordable and Clean Energy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chemical recycling enables plastics to be a part of the circular economy as it can cope with contaminated as well as mixed plastics waste. Herein, two important discoveries are reported. One innovation is the use of table salt (NaCl) to facilitate the low temperature pyrolysis of polyolefins comprised of high‐density polyethylene (HDPE), low‐density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low‐density polyethylene (LLDPE), and polypropylene (PP) at the ratio of (4:2:2:3), respectively, thus enabling the efficient recycling of these mixed plastics. For comparative analysis, two different Pt catalysts as well as a control are investigated. Compared to the control, the use of table salt at 10 wt.% increased both the oil and gas contents by 80% and enabled 100% conversion to gas and oil without producing any undesirable wax. The second innovation is that metallized plastics are successfully pyrolyzed with table salt with excellent conversion efficiencies. The obtained oil fraction is further characterized using gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC‐MS). In addition, the re‐use of salt, the effect of salt particle size and effect of the wt.% are explored. The thermal properties of the wax (solid) are characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Economic estimation revealed a 3.5‐fold increase in revenue can be generated by the novel method as compared to pyrolysis without any salt. In contrast, pyrolysis with a conventional Pt/alumina system incurs huge losses. These findings suggest that table salt can offer a transformative approach toward an inexpensive (4 cents per kg) and efficient pyrolysis methodology for the conversion of mixed plastics waste to useful hydrocarbon products.",

Low‐cost, carbon‐based sorbents named nanoporous sponges (NPS) are recently developed, exhibiting fast and repeatable water uptake of 0.14 g g − 1 at 90% relative pressure. While useful from a cost and daily water yield point of view, there is room for improvement. This article presents an improved production process combining pyrolysis and activation under CO 2 in a single step, yielding improved NPS capable of reproducibly reaching a water uptake of 0.47 g g −1 at 95% relative pressure while maintaining fast sorption rates. The NPS show significant endurance and are able to maintain stable performance over numerous humidity cycles. An unexpected time‐dependant sorption behavior is also identified for NPS produced with a modified synthesis formulation, due to an increase in sodium carbonate residual content.",

Electrodeposition resulting from local pH changes near an oxygen or water reduction electrode can be used to grow valuable minerals in seawater for use in the cement and concrete industries, with the potential to use clean electricity without relying on the mining of resources. Limited knowledge is available about the electrochemical reaction networks that yield mineral precipitates via electrodeposition in seawater, hindering a complete assessment of the promise of such an approach to serving the construction industry. This work presents an investigation of the electrodeposition in seawater as a function of the applied potential. The work identifies multiple electrochemical potential regimes that yield distinct polymorphs, quantities, and production rates of calcium and magnesium‐based minerals due to the varying rates of oxygen reduction and water‐splitting reactions. The quality of the produced minerals is comparable to that of traditionally mined aggregates in terms of morphology and composition, supporting that seawater represents a vast source of raw materials for use in the construction industry upon an enhancement in the efficiency of hydroxide‐producing reactions and the reactor design.",

The excellent uranium extraction performance is attributed to the unique UAM structure, in which water flows through the channels of thin metal‐organic framework (MOF) film without blocking by substrate leading to the high flux during filtration, and the full contact of uranium with abundant exposed active sites promotes the adsorption.

However, developing hybrid heterostructures capable of efficiently breaking down water into its constituent elements, hydrogen, and oxygen, presents a considerable challenge. In this study, a novel hierarchical POM/Pd/MoS 2 hybrid heterostructure, composed of sheets of MoS 2 modified with Pd nanoparticles and combined with a cobalt‐based polyoxometalate (POM), serving as bifunctional catalyst for water splitting is reported. Through a synergistic synthetic approach, MoS 2 , acting as a reducing agent, triggers the nucleation and growth of Pd nanoparticles, which, in turn, serve as anchoring sites for the polymerization of the cobalt‐based POM into fibers. POM/Pd/MoS 2 hybrid exhibits an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, comparable to the benchmark catalysts Ir/C and IrO 2 /C in alkaline media, being its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity similar to the activated Pd/MoS 2 hybrid. The intriguing electrocatalytic capability of the resulting material for producing hydrogen and oxygen through electrochemical means arises from the enhanced charge storage capacity and conductivity of MoS 2 , the multi‐electron transfer facilitated by the POM, and the high electrocatalytic activity of the metals.",

Starting with an ionic liquid consisting of a metal coordination cation (MetIL), ferrocene‐containing ligands and iodide anions are substituted incrementally into the structure. While chemical structures can be drawn for molecules with 10 m redox‐active electrons (RAE), practical limitations such as melting point and phase stability constrain the structures to 4.2 m RAE, a 2.3× improvement over the original MetIL. Dubbed “MetILs 3 ,” these ionic liquids possess redox activity in the cation core, ligands, and anions.

Square wave voltammetry reveals redox processes characteristic of each molecular location. Testing a laboratory‐scale RFB demonstrates Coulombic efficiencies &gt;95% and increased voltage efficiencies due to more facile redox kinetics, effectively increasing capacity 4×.

Large surface areas combined with extraordinary electronic, electrochemical, and thermal properties make these atomically thin, layered materials fascinating candidates for diverse applications, ranging from sensing to energy storage and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, it is essential to solve the problem of scalable and green production of 2D materials before being able to bring them from laboratory to industry. In this sense, the exfoliation of 2D materials in water, free from any stabilizer, is very important since it is a gateway technology toward their production as well as future applications. This Communication reports the direct exfoliation of atomically thin MoSe 2 layers in water, which bypasses the Hansen solubility parameters theory and suggests potential for liquid‐phase exfoliation of 2D materials. A combination of long‐time sonication and high‐speed centrifugation results in a substantial fraction of monolayers. When applied in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, these atomically thin MoSe 2 layers can significantly outperform bulk MoSe 2 .

    "abstract": "Abstract Use of lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (QD) films as photoactive layers in photovoltaic (PV) devices typically requires replacement of native QD ligands with lead‐based capping ligands (i.e., PbX 2 , X = Br, I) for the best‐performing QD PVs. This ligand replacement process often requires additional solvents and toxic reagents. In the present study, an alternative PbS QD PV fabrication method with a lead‐free tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) ligand source and lower material requirements and toxicity is demonstrated, yielding 10% power conversion efficient PVs with more than 1000 h of storage stability under ambient conditions. Evaluation of the economic and toxicological benefits of this new ligand exchange protocol reveals a 72% reduction in synthesis costs, an 80% reduction in solvent volumes, and a nearly 250‐fold reduction in lead waste generated compared to the previous PbX 2 ‐based protocol for highest‐performing QD PVs. Most significantly, it is shown that unencapsulated PbS QD PVs made from this TBAI method leach less lead than U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limits and thus do not require hazardous waste disposal at the end of life. This finding implies a further decrease in expected device costs, extending progress toward large‐scale production of commercial PbS QD PVs with low environmental risk.",

La(Ni 0.95 Fe 0.05 ) 5 (LNF) has achieved significant attention as a HS media due to its suitable thermodynamics. However, its use as an effective storage material is hindered due to burning of hydrogenated LNF (LNFH) on exposure to air. The pristine LNFH catches fire rapidly on exposure to atmosphere. Here, a breakthrough strategy is demonstrated for design of hydrogenated air‐stabilized hybrid material by encapsulating LNF inside reduced graphene oxide‐ethyl cellulose. This novel hybrid material does not ignite upon exposure to air. This proposed hybrid material could be the ultimate choice for air‐stable and safe storage for fuel cell/internal combustion engine‐based vehicles.

    "abstract": "Abstract The integration of electrocatalyst (EC) with light‐absorbing semiconductor photoelectrode is regarded as a representative framework for photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. When considering the charge transfer pathways, PEC performance is governed by the charge kinetics at the EC/electrolyte and the semiconductor/EC interfaces. Here, systematic investigations are reported, made on the overall kinetics of the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline electrolyte. A non‐stoichiometric (Ni‐rich) NiO x ( x &lt; 1) EC is deposited on a Si photocathode passivated with a SiO x layer. A few distinctive features of the Ni‐rich NiO x film are identified in contrast with the conventional O‐rich NiO y ( y ≥ 1) which could lower the series resistance along the charge transfer pathways. The Ni‐rich NiO x is found to possess both NiO and NiNi (by oxygen‐vacancy) bonds, which act as suitable catalytic sites for dissociating water molecules and recombining two hydrogen atoms, respectively. In addition, the Ni‐rich NiO x reveals both n‐type and metallic conduction behavior, a feature that may contribute to lowering bulk resistance as well as tunneling resistance through SiOx layer. As a result, this noble metal‐free EC‐integrated Si photocathode achieves the highest potential of 0.41 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode to produce a photocurrent density of 10 mA cm 2 .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), MoS 2 , and WS 2 have emerged as low‐cost and earth‐abundant electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, electrocatalytic HER performance of these TMDCs, supported by few layered graphene and loaded on a 3D framework of Ni foam (Gr/NF), is reported. The graphene in Gr/NF is prepared from inexpensive camphor by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The graphene‐supported TMDCs anchored on the Ni foam are demonstrated with a low overpotential for HER below 200 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 which is comparable to their edge terminated counterparts and surpassing that of unsupported bulk or amorphous TMDCs. In addition, their small Tafel slopes (95 and 83 mV dec −1 for MoS 2 ‐ and WS 2 ‐based Gr/NF electrocatalysts, respectively), charge transfer resistance, and long‐term stability make them promising non‐noble electrocatalysts. First principle investigations of the (Mo/W)S 2 /Gr/NF heterostructure shows that their enhanced electrocatalytic activity can be attributed to the d‐band shift in the transition metals, Mo/W (a larger shift for WS 2 ) by Ni, promoting unoccupied antibonding orbitals which facilitate the hydrogen adsorption–desorption process.",

In particular, they show excellent resistance to mechanical stress, like bending or rubbing, and are highly stable in ambient atmosphere over several months. Therefore they may represent a very promising candidate to be employed in green electronics, thanks to the reduced energy consumption required for their fabrication, the absence of toxic components or chemicals that are derived from oil, and the possibility to disassemble the devices at the end of their life in environmentally friendly conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For organic solar cells, the different surface‐free energies (SFE) of donors and acceptors leads to inhomogeneous distribution at the upper and bottom surfaces of the photoactive layer. Undesired distribution of donors and acceptors is unfavorable for charge collection. Adjusting the SFE of the underlying interfacial layer can effectively change the distribution of donors and acceptors within the photoactive layer. Herein, Nafion, a perfluorinated polymer containing the fluorocarbon backbone and perfluorovinyl ether branch with sulfonic acid end groups, is introduced to adjust the SFE of poly‐(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly‐(styrenesulphonicacid) (PEDOT:PSS). The work‐function change of the PEDOT:PSS before and after doping with Nafion is explored by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The contact angles of water and diiodomethane on the PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS‐Nafion are measured and their SFE are calculated from the Owens formula. Interfacial layer induced phase separation is investigated by energy‐dispersive spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The device resistance and carrier lifetime are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intensity‐modulated photovoltage spectroscopy. By accurately adjusting the ratio of Nafion to PEDOT:PSS, the optimized device with PBDB‐TCL:IT‐4F achieves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.12% and the device based on PEDOT:PSS‐Nafion with PBDB‐TF:Y6 achieves the PCE of 16.31%.",

Herein, a mechanochemical method for preparation of degradable biofilm tannic acid‐modified microfibrillated cellulose (TA@MFC)‐G is proposed. The method involves modification of a microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) with plant polyphenol (tannic acid), followed by complexation with gelatin in an aqueous solution. Compared with pure gelatin film, MFC film has higher intrinsic crystallinity and thermal stability. Due to the synergistic effect of tannin and MFC, the mechanical strength and flexibility of the films are improved; its tensile strength is higher than 75 MPa and its elongation at break is as high as 13%. The films also have high UV blocking ability. Finally, the films are printed using Fe 3+ ions or conventional ink, from which it is observed that the pattern printed using Fe 3+ ions has higher solvent resistance and water repellency compared to that printed using conventional ink. This biodegradable film may have promising applications as food packaging materials or in other industries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Here, a novel integration is proposed for radio frequency (1–300 MHz) responsive nanomaterials with conventional catalytic materials to realize a new class of heterogeneous catalysts that undergo uniform volumetric and localized heating to drive chemical transformations at the modular scale. Approximately 80% of chemical manufacturing involves heterogeneous catalytic reactions, which currently require heating via steam utilities or fired furnaces, and thus contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions while also limiting distributed chemicals production. This approach uses an electric route to produce chemicals where radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields and their interaction with carbon/ceramic nanomaterials are utilized to selectively heat the catalyst composition. A proof‐of‐concept is demonstrated using the commonly studied methanol steam reforming reaction on a platinum catalyst. In this study, two RF susceptors are used: carbon nanotubes and silicon carbide fibers. The conversion rate of methanol using RF heating is comparable to oven heating at varying temperature and catalyst combinations. This is a potential improvement over conventional catalytic reactors in that it enables small, safe, sustainable, on‐site, and on‐demand production of chemicals in the absence of traditional manufacturing infrastructure.",

Efficient and sustainable technologies are urgently needed to achieve seawater desalination and wastewater treatment. Here, a hybrid device is developed consisting of photovoltaics (PV), membrane distillation (MD), and electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) for sustainable freshwater production and wastewater treatment. The device obtains freshwater from seawater with a stable rate of 0.97 kg m –2 h –1 under 1 sun, and the produced clean water reaches the drinking water limit of the WHO. This device also obtains freshwater from a methylene blue (MB) solution at a stable water production rate of 0.75 kg m –2 h –1 , and the concentrated MB solution demonstrates a degradation rate of 96.05% by in situ degradation of EAOPs. The high water‐production performance and degradation performance is attributed to the well‐designed structure of the three stages PV‐MD‐EAOPs device, which enables both the latent heat recycle of water evaporation and the contaminants enrichment of wastewater. To summarize, a new path is explored for in situ thermal and electricity utilization of photovoltaic for efficient treatment of wastewater, which is a meaningful way for synchronous clean water production and wastewater treatment.",

The diversity of life found in the habitats created by corals is so large that the reefs are known as the “rainforests of the sea.” Unfortunately, severe natural and anthropogenic changes such as ocean warming, acidification, coral diseases, and plastic pollution are extremely detrimental to this ecosystem. To enrich the ambient conditions of the corals and boost their growth, the potential of two biocomposites is evaluated based on biodegradable polyurethane and silicone matrices as scaffolds for the growth of oceanic organisms. Furthermore, their degradation is investigated within the coral reefs of Faafu Atoll, Republic of Maldives. The observations indicate that there are a significant number of organisms that settle and grow on these biocomposites in the Maldivian lagoon, both of an animal and photosynthetic nature. The biocomposites have the potential to become suitable scaffolds for diverse hard bottom fouling organisms. Moreover, the presence of coral larvae on the biocomposites suggests that during their biodegradation, these biocomposites can support the growth of organisms, generating a suitable environment for triggering the birth of new corals.",

The catalysts are evaluated in gas‐phase H 2 photo‐production using ethanol as an electron donor, observing changes in the hydrogen evolution with the TiO 2 loading with an optimum charge of 20% w/w. In addition, the presence of Pt leads to a huge enhancement of the catalytic activity showing also a volcano plot behavior, the 20% w/w again being the best catalyst (895.9 µmol H 2 g cat −1 ). This system also exhibits a high stability without a decrease in the production after 15 h. By means of different characterization techniques, it is possible to determine the interaction among the active phase, the metallic nanoparticle, and the catalytic support. These studies indicate that the use of mesoporous silica SBA‐15 as a support increases the dispersion of the active phase, resulting in an increase in the evolution rate of H 2 . However, the lowest percentages of TiO 2 give rise to amorphous TiO 2 particles with high amount of superficial defects increasing the e − ‐h + recombination rate and decreasing the H 2 production.",

This review is focused on examining the fundamentals that govern the function of supercritical fluids in the pretreatment stage, as well as in the main hydrolysis reaction. Sub/supercritical carbon dioxide is used in pretreatment and sub/supercritical water has been the solvent of choice in hydrolysis of LCB. Significant research has gone into understanding the effect of process parameters such as temperature, pressure, cosolvent, and use of external catalyst on the sugar yield in biorefining of the LCB in supercritical fluids. It is shown that processes with reduced environmental impact and energy consumption can significantly enhance biorefining of LCB at commercial scale. Enzymatic hydrolysis of LCB in supercritical carbon dioxide is a promising approach that can accommodate mild reaction conditions. Developing an understanding of the performance of enzymes in high pressure systems and designing carriers for enzyme immobilization and further recycling is expected to enable one pot pretreatment and hydrolysis and is an important milestone in processing renewable resources for deriving biofuel and value‐added chemicals.",

MS‐GLAD gives rise to metallic titanium columnar structures with regular width and length that after thermal treatment are fully oxidized to form TiO 2 nanocolumns that maintain the morphological features of the original metallic ones. Further functionalization with gold by means of multiple ion cluster source results in well‐dispersed Au nanoparticles across the nanocolumns’ surface with a narrow size distribution centered at ca. 8.5 nm. The obtained nanostructures show photocatalytic self‐cleaning activity as shown by the elimination of an organic layer deposited on their surface and the detection of hydroxyl radicals. Photoelectrochemical measurements show a better charge separation at the Au/TiO 2 interface. In addition, wettability studies show that the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface is increased by the presence of nanocolumns, both in the dark and under UV illumination. This behavior is not modified by the presence of Au nanoparticles on the surface. The obtained results open up interesting implications in the tunability of the properties of nanostructured thin films for this kind of photo‐activated application.",

The samples are prepared by solution combustion synthesis (SCS), leading to materials with high thermal resistance, purity, and crystallinity, consisting of metallic nickel nanoparticles supported on La‐doped ceria. The study of the ferromagnetic Curie temperature ( T C ) and magnetization cycles suggest that the Ni nanoparticles are superparamagnetic, exhibiting magnetic order at room temperature, with T C strongly dependent on the particle size; this spans from 1.9, up to 80 nm. The structural study from synchrotron X‐ray diffraction data and Raman spectroscopy clearly show the presence of oxygen vacancies in the fluorite crystal structure of the Ce 0.9 La 0.1 O 2− δ matrix, which increase in the spent catalysts by forming a greater proportion of Ce 3+ compared with their fresh counterparts. This is confirmed from the Raman spectra, showing an increase in the relative intensity of the band placed between 520 and 610 cm −1 . All the catalysts show very high reaction rate per unit mass of catalyst; the CO 2 conversion after 6 h for the catalyst with 10% Ni molar (Ni 0.1 /Ce 0.9 La 0.1 ) is 57% (2.4 moles CO·h −1 ·g catalyst −1 ), very close to the thermodynamic equilibrium (59.3%).",

The aged foams are able to retain their properties at 180 °C for as long as 24 h, far exceeding the properties of most classical petroleum‐based thermoplastics. The foams are further developed into soft foams by the addition of glycerol as a plasticizer. The improvement in the mechanical performance of the foams with aging, which is equivalent to an increase by one order of magnitude in modulus and yield strength, is confirmed to be associated with (iso)peptide crosslinks. The results open the way for using protein‐based foam materials in severe/corrosive environments such as filtration, thermal insulation, and fluid absorption.

From the results of characterization analysis, it is clear that EHB additive improves the crystallinity of the donor by regulating the kinetic process of active layer formation, selectively solubilizes the more aggregated fullerene acceptors, which allows PTB7‐Th to enter the conformational domain of PC 71 BM, and accelerates the molecular rearrangement. Besides, the EHB additive not only reduces the recombination, increases the carrier migration rate but also promotes the crystallinity of the donor, resulting in a tighter stacking. This work provides a green combination of solvents and additives that is important for the mass production of solar cells.",

In this study, Arthrospira maxima is cultivated in an integrated system with a dye‐sensitized solar module (DSSM) to the front of the PBR to assess the possible advantages for biomass and phycocyanin production. The application of the DSSM does not influence biomass production, with the remarkable advantage of producing additional electric energy. However, an acclimation of pigment is observed, as DSSM causes a change in the transmitted light spectrum. Further experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of light quality using monochromatic light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) as controls. Phycocyanin‐targeted wavelengths exhibit a major impact on biomass growth and pigment productivity: low intensity enhanced process efficiency, suggesting that low light is preferable to enhance culture performance with respect to white light. The application of third‐generation PVs is only potentially advantageous if the transmission spectra of the module color and its aperture area are carefully designed. The application of monochromatic LEDs on PBRs also highlights the importance of properly managing the operative conditions to avoid energy losses.",

The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of anisole specifically represents a model reaction for the conversion of lignin to biofuels through the removal of the aromatic carbon‐oxygen bonds. To date, a range of Ni‐based catalysts have been reported as highly active systems for the HDO of anisole. However, there has been a substantial lack of consideration given to the environmental characteristics of these catalytic systems, in contrast with the scope of the sustainable production of biofuels. Herein, Ni‐based SiO 2 catalysts are prepared by a solventless and highly efficient mechanochemistry approach, having a considerably lower environmental impact as compared to standard impregnation methods. Importantly, scrap catalytic converters (SCATs) are employed as co‐catalysts, proving the possibility of enhancing the catalytic HDO of anisole, with a scarcely exploited waste material. The results demonstrate that the combined use of Ni/SiO 2 as catalysts and Ni/SCATs as co‐catalysts remarkably boosts the rate of the conversion of anisole up to more than 50% by achieving an almost complete conversion of anisole in only 40 min instead of at 200 °C and 4 MPa H 2 .",

Thus, the use of milder reaction temperature (110 °C) favors the formation of furfuryl alcohol and alkyl furfuryl ethers, while higher temperatures (170 °C) promote the formation of alkyl levulinate and γ‐valerolactone, as well as an increase in nondetected products associated to the formation of humins due to the polymerization of furfural and/or furfuryl alcohol.",

However, despite many improvements in materials and cell designs used in SWBs so far, there is a limit on the energy density in practical use, because of the lack of optimization of the cell structure. Herein, this work introduces a novel design by applying a rigid frame with an extended space called “prismatic‐type.” Consequently, an energy density of 23 Wh (242 Wh L ‐1 ) is obtained by increasing the specific area of the unit cell and the capability of the anode active materials in the internal space. In addition, it enables the design of a discrete type that can improve the power density by increasing the surface area of the cathode current collectors. With the increased surface area, a peak power of 1162 mW is achieved for the discrete type compared to 727 mW for the integral type. These results suggest that these newly designed prismatic SWBs could contribute to practical applications in the near future.",

Bioresources such as starch and cellulose are attractive candidates for sustainable materials. Despite the enticing aspects, engineering high‐performance materials from starch and cellulose have not been feasible due to the suboptimal performance of the final products. Here, this work reports a high‐strength and all‐green resin synthesized from low‐cost and abundant sustainable resources of starch, citric acid (CA), and lignin through esterification. The resulting resin discloses a record high strength (158.79 ± 6.51 MPa) and toughness (6.26 ± 0.39 MJ m −3 ), well above the existing starch‐based and epoxy resins. The adhesion strength (23.94 ± 1.092 MPa) of the resin to cellulose film highlights its feasibility in developing high‐performance cellulose‐reinforced polymer composite. A nanocellulose‐based long filament is manufactured via wet‐spinning on a continuous rapid fiber production system and knit into mats to ascertain the hypothesis. By integrating the resin into nanocellulose‐based filament mats through hand‐layup, hot‐pressing, and postcuring, an all‐green composite is conceived with excellent flexural strength (315.9 ± 20.1 MPa) and stiffness (34.4 ± 1.16 MPa).

The composite formation, correlation between performance and morphology is studied by comparison with manual mixing and jet milling. Superior charge storage capacity with ≈70% of the total contribution from the Faradaic process involving the redox functionality of lignin is observed in a mechanically milled composite. In comparison, manual mix shows only ≈30% from the lignin storage participation while the rest is due to the electric double layer at the carbon–electrolyte interface. The significant participation of lignin in the ball milled composite is attributed to the homogeneous, intimate mixing of the carbon and the lignin leading the electronic carrier transported in the carbon phase to reach most of the redox group of lignin. A maximum capacity of 49 mAh g −1 is obtained at charge/discharge rate of 0.25 A g −1 for the sample milled for 60 min.",

Aqueous dispersion of nanoparticles based on Ecovio loaded with an active compound (Neem oil as concept proof) is first synthesized by single emulsion–solvent evaporation technique using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as a surfactant. Then, this dispersion is used to prepare films by casting. The feasibility of upcycling (i.e., deconstruction and reassembly of the films) is obtained through a water-dependent dynamic phenomenon, where the PVA acts as polymer matrix or surfactant depending on the hydration of the surrounding medium (dry or wet conditions). Nanocompartmentalized films demonstrate improved mechanical performance and reduced transmittance in UVA and UVB spectra, while the nanoparticles (wet condition) show superior stability (more than 9 months). The proposed method allows preparing films with high compartmentalization efficiency that can be used, for instance, as insect-repellent packaging. Just by adding the films in water, the aqueous dispersion of nanoparticles can be used for controlled release of pesticides, leading to high added value material that fits the circular economy.",

Herein, brown algal biomass residue (AR, after bio‐stimulant extraction, currently poorly valorized) is tested for the removal of Ni(II), Cd(II), and La(III) from aqueous solutions. This valorization of industrial waste makes profit of residual amounts of alginate‐based materials, which have a strong affinity for metal cations. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques are used for characterizing metal/biosorbent interactions. Uptake kinetics are relatively fast (equilibrium being reached in 180–240 min). The Sips equation fits the sorption isotherms; the maximum sorption capacities at pH ≈5 reach up to 0.84 mmol La g −1 , 0.92 mmol Cd g −1 , and 0.78 mmol Ni g −1 . In binary solutions, AR shows marked preference for La(III) over divalent cations. This selectivity may be increased by complexing base metals with EDTA, opening the route for the selective recovery of rare earth elements. HCl solution reveals more efficient (&gt;90% for La(III), ≈82% for Cd(II) and Ni(II)) than CaCl 2 solution at pH 2 for metal desorption.

Herein, oxygen vacancy (OV)‐rich NiFe‐layered hydroxides (NiFe‐OH) nanosheet arrays are vertically orientated on Ni‐protected Si photoanodes by a facile solvothermal method followed by a hot Fe ion‐exchange treatment. By virtue of the formation of OVs on NiFe‐OH nanosheets and the vertical contact between the NiFe‐OH and Si substrate, the as‐prepared Si photoanode not only enables abundant active sites for OER but also boosts charge and mass transfer when compared to traditional electro‐deposit samples. Moreover, the vertical contact of NiFe‐OH on Ni/Si benefits to release the interfacial stress and thereby promotes the electrode stability. Consequently, the optimal Si photoanode shows an ultrahigh applied bias photon‐to‐current efficiency of 5.7% and a good stability of over 200 h, outdoing almost all of the recently reported Si photoanodes.",

Research on CO 2 electrolysis has vastly progressed, focusing on catalysis and electrode design, leaving an essential question on the central part of the electrolyzer: Which type of ion exchange membrane is best suited for CO 2 electrolysis from an economic perspective? To address this question, holistic process optimization of CO 2 reduction and product purification is applied. The findings demonstrate that CO 2 electrolysis with an anion exchange membrane shows competitive production costs for CO of 796 €/t CO , outperforming cation exchange and bipolar membranes. Unlike often described, the CO 2 pumping effect does not significantly impair the economics but offers an efficient indirect regeneration of dissociated CO 2 . Furthermore, the results emphasize selective reduction of CO 2 rather than co‐electrolysis of CO 2 and H 2 O. While pointing to a positive economic perspective, life‐cycle assessment highlights the need to minimize CO 2 emissions related to electricity consumption and incomplete CO 2 utilization.",

Local molecular mobility and temperature‐dependent relaxation and recovery of the non‐equilibrium networked states enable exploiting these simultaneous functionalities. Transitions involving solidification and structure stabilization at ambient temperature spanning several hours after preheating only at 70 °C directly contrast typical thermoplastic or thermoplastic elastomer behaviors.

In this work, dual‐action electrical and EM‐responsive mechanoreceptors are prepared from electrically conductive polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticle (NP)‐infiltrated anisotropic wood (PW) aerogels. The prepared PW aerogels are composed of curved stacked layers of aligned cellulose nanofibers, and can be reversibly condensed and reconstructed for conductive network control during cyclic compression. These PW aerogels can withstand up to 74% compressive strain in a tangential direction and exhibit pressing‐enhanced electrical conductivity and polarization loss. The piezoresistive gauge factor (GF) and linearity of the PW aerogels can be adjusted by varying the PPy deposition time, leading to varying GF values in the range of 1.87–4.62. During mechanosensing based on EMI shielding effectiveness (SE), rapid off/on switching between the EM wave transmission and shielding is achieved when the SE varies above and below the effective EMI shielding area (&gt;20 dB) through continuous compression. Such dual‐action electrical/EM off/on wood aerogel switches provide opportunities for the development of advanced smart devices from biomass resources.",

The electrochemical performance of NiAl‐LDH can be further improved by introducing the appropriate amount of Ti 3 C 2 MXene by hydrothermal method. And NiAl‐LDH@Ti 3 C 2 is simply compounded with ZnCdS in a certain ratio to obtain ZnCdS/NiAl‐LDH@Ti 3 C 2 . By studying different ratios of ZCSNAT, the optimal ratio of hydrogen evolution activity is 27.10 mmol g −1 h −1 under alkaline solution, which is 9.96 and 1.67 times higher than ZCS and ZnCdS/NiAl‐LDH‐20, while ZnCdS/NiAl‐LDH@Ti 3 C 2 ‐20 reaches 1883 µmol (37.66 mmol g −1 h −1 ) in acidic solution, 13.84 and 2.32 times higher than ZnCdS and ZnCdS/NiAl‐LDH‐20. This apparent enhancement is mainly due to the doping of Ti 3 C 2 in the NiAl‐LDH preparation to achieve improved electrochemical properties of NiAl‐LDH. The better electron induction effect of NiAl‐LDH@Ti 3 C 2 greatly improves the electron mobility to the NA surface, which results in a higher photogenerated electron–hole separation efficiency of the composite catalyst based on the original one.",

The combination of heteroatom construction and vacancy engineering has been used to improve the OER performance of bismuth‐based electrocatalysts, but few studies can clearly describe the roles of dopants and vacancies in improving OER performance. Herein, N dopants and S vacancies in Bi 2 S 3 nanorods via one‐step NH 3 /Ar plasma etching to investigate the enhanced OER performance are constructed. N dopants and S vacancies both regulated the intrinsic charge ordering of Bi 2 S 3 nanorods, enhancing the p‐band center and Fermi level while also boosting the electroconductivity and wettability of the material. In addition, density functional theory calculations suggest that N doping promoted the adsorption of Bi sites, while S vacancies favored the desorption of S sites. Under the synergistic effects of N dopants and S vacancies, Bi 2 S 3 ‐based electrocatalysts exhibited a low overpotential of 374 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and satisfactory durability, demonstrating a feasible strategy for exploiting main group element OER electrocatalysts.",

CDs are prepared from citric acid (CA) and ethylenediamine (EDA) via hydrothermal treatment. Using MB as a model pollutant, it is observed that, under visible‐light irradiation, the nanocomposite presents an increment of the catalytic performance of 367% when compared to bare TiO 2 . This is achieved because the addition of CDs leads to increased visible‐light absorption and hinders the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Thus, CDs are capable of bridging some of the limitations posed by TiO 2 . Tests using reactive species scavengers indicate that the main active species involved in the photodegradation by the nanocomposites are superoxide radicals followed by hydroxyl radicals, which differs from bare TiO 2 . Lastly, a life cycle assessment (LCA) study shows that, when accounting for performance, the nanocomposites have lower relative environmental impacts than bare TiO 2 . In addition, the safety of the produced CDs is shown by in vitro assays. In summary, due to conjugation with CDs, a relevant increment in the catalytic performance of TiO 2 is achieved; providing an important step toward the sustainable rational design of active visible‐light‐driven photocatalysts.",

Therefore, a cable cross‐tie triboelectric‐electromagnetic hybrid generator triggered by vibrations in bridge cables (CCT‐TEHG) is proposed. The CCT‐TEHG enhances the natural frequency of the cables by connecting adjacent cables, thereby preventing low‐frequency resonance. The device connects adjacent bridge cables to increase the natural frequency, preventing low‐frequency resonance. Comprising triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electromagnetic generators (EMG), the CCT‐TEHG effectively broadens the frequency range for energy harvesting, capturing vibrational energy from bridge cables in cable‐stayed bridges. The TENG module in CCT‐TEHG features a soft‐contact design, incorporating rabbit fur to supplement charges and enhance output density. This design also avoids direct material contact between generator units, improving operational durability. The experimental results show that the maximum output voltage and current of the TENG and EMG modules can respectively reach up to 270 V, 13 V, and 5.2 µA, 18 mA, and peak power to 2.04 mW, 10 mW. The CCT‐TEHG can function as a power source, sufficient to power 303 light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) or a 20 mW temperature and humidity sensor. Therefore, CCT‐TEHG has good application prospects in the field of bridge cable vibration energy harvest.",

Herein, Molybdenum sulfo selenide (MoSSe)/black phosphorous (BP) heterostructure is synthesized by a one‐pot solvothermal technique, and energy storage and conversion efficiency are characterized.

To validate the experimental findings, Density Functional Theory (DFT) computational simulations are carried out concurrently. The lower diffusion energy barrier for electrolytic ions, in the case of hybrid MoSSe/BP compared to pristine MoSSe, supports the higher charge storage performance. Finally, MoSSe/BP nanocomposites' photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance is evaluated under 400 W of UV–vis light, with eosin Y dye acting as a sensitizer and triethanolamine acting as a sacrificial agent.

Here, a mixed‐dimensional membrane is designed to solve the above‐mentioned problems by assembling two kinds of in situ grown 0D@2D functional building blocks of SiO 2 @GO and TiO 2 @MXene. Specifically, the obtained membrane exhibits high and maintainable water permeance of 2114 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 as well as high rejection rates toward organic dyes thanks to the plentiful firm water channels constructed by 0D@2D structures and the negative charges on both SiO 2 @GO and TiO 2 @MXene, respectively. Moreover, the 0D@2D TiO 2 @MXene serves as photocatalyst, rendering the composite membrane intriguing self‐cleaning function under UV irradiation, which is verified by the high recovery ratios of water permeance (97.5%) and dye interception rate (98.7%).

Sustainable water management necessitates alternative sources such as abandoned mine water.

Conventional methods struggle to effectively treat these heavy metals in abandoned mining ponds, urging the search for cost‐efficient and sustainable solutions.

This study aims to employ ANFIS to forecast SMC biochar's performance in a lab‐scale metal retention pond, providing design charts for diverse initial metal concentrations and pH levels. Validation through real cases aims to enhance accuracy and establish a framework for future heavy metal adsorption capacities.

After the reduction of the NiO‐MgO samples at 500 °C, the catalysts are tested in the furfural (FUR) hydrogenation to obtain valuable products in a one‐pot reaction. The catalysts are highly selective toward tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) with a yield above 50% in most cases as well as 1,2‐pentanediol (1,2‐PeD) and 1,5‐pentanediol (1,5‐PeD) with maximum yield of 22 and 23% after 22 h of reaction at 170 °C and 4 MPa of H 2 , respectively. The present work also suggests the presence of two routes in the furfuryl hydrogenation. The first one is associated with the reduction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and the hydrogenation of the ring yielding THFA. In the second route, once FOL is formed, the furanic ring is open to form 1,2‐PeD and 1,5PeD.",

In this study, a one‐step supercritical fluid synthesis is presented to craft a unique heteroepitaxial composite, incorporating nickel di‐selenide nanoparticles on niobium carbide MXene nanosheets in various ratios. The integration of 2D nanosheets enhances the kinetics of the electrode reaction process, while NiSe 2 facilitates efficient charge transport in MXene. The composite demonstrated superior performance with the 1:2 ratio of NiSe 2 /Nb 2 CTx demonstrates an impressive specific capacitance of 1309 C g −1 at 2 A g −1 current density in a three‐electrode system. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapattery, featuring NiSe 2 /Nb 2 CTx 1:2 (positive electrode) and bio‐derived activated carbon (AC) (negative electrode) achieves a gravimetric capacitance of 205 C/g at 0.5 A g −1 current density, a power density of 10,800 W kg −1 at the energy density of 64 Wh kg −1 , with 90% retention after 12 000 cycles. As a catalyst for water oxidation, the NiSe 2 /Nb 2 CTx 1:2 exhibits the lowest over potential of 359 mV at the current density 10 mA cm −2 and Tafel slope of 105 mV dec −1 .

The method is presented and applied to a case study where a two‐axis tracking concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) and a single‐axis silicon photovoltaic (SiPV) system installed at a sub‐tropical location in Australia, are to power the production of hydrogen by electrolysis. The analysis quantifies the performance of the PV systems from data gathered at the site and reveals the complementarity of these two systems in their output at different timescales. An optimization problem is then defined that seeks the optimal ratio of CPV and SiPV to achieve high annual power output and, importantly, a good match between power supply and demand profiles. The benefits of this approach are illustrated for a green hydrogen power‐to‐gas‐to‐power plant under two operating modes. For this case study, the optimal PV ratio of 0.33CPV: 0.67SiPV leads to reduced dependence on the electricity grid, and a maximum guaranteed minimal take‐up of hydrogen over all months in a year. Overall, the sustainability of the plant is increased without the need for additional storage, and therefore additional resources.",

However, the lack of in‐depth understanding of the reaction mechanism and clear identification of the catalytic active site has hindered the further development of low‐cost, high‐performance, and long‐life efficient electrocatalysts. Through in situ characterization techniques, the activity and stability of catalysts can be monitored in real‐time, track the structural evolution of catalytic reaction intermediates, and obtain a deep understanding of catalytic reaction mechanism, so as to feedback and guide the development and utilization of the catalyst. In this review, advanced development of in situ characterization techniques in electrocatalytic HER in recent years is summarized. In situ spectroscopy can be used to track the behavior of reaction intermediates such as adsorption, desorption, and structural evolution at the molecular level to reveal the electrocatalytic HER mechanism. The imaging techniques can be used to observe the evolution of material structure during HER in situ, which provides valuable information for the understanding of visualization of catalytic hydrogen evolution at atomic level.

Here, a cyano and carbon dots/polypyrrole (CDs/PPy) co‐modified carbon nitride (CPKCN) heterostructure is constructed for photocatalytic H 2 O 2 generation. It is interestingly found that the intermediates formed during the oxidation polymerization of pyrrole can be the potential electron trapping sites and reactive sites. In addition, the localized photoheat produced by CDs/PPy also plays an active role in improving photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the addition of CDs/PPy leads to a higher negative zeta potential of CPKCN, which is favorable for the attraction of the sample surface to H + . These features, plus the positive effect of cyano groups, collectively boost the charge transfer and improve the selectivity of two‐electron O 2 reduction. Therefore, the enhanced photocatalytic H 2 O 2 generation performance of the developed CPKCN is achieved, with an H 2 O 2 generation rate of 3.7 mmol g −1 h −1 under visible light in a 10 vol% isopropanol (IPA) aqueous solution, and with the apparent quantum yield of 16.7% at 420 nm and the solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 0.34%.

Here the super‐black wood is characterized, the process used to make it is described and its possible practical uses are discussed. Wood samples are exposed to oxygen glow‐discharge plasma. Transverse surfaces exposed to high‐energy plasma have a deep‐black velvety appearance. The reflectance of these surfaces is measured and compared with those of commercial super‐black materials. The reflectivity of samples over a narrower wavelength range is measured with a spectrophotometer and converted into lightness values. The microstructure and surface chemistry of super‐black wood are examined using SEM/X‐ray micro‐CT and FTIR spectroscopy, respectively. Transverse basswood samples modified with high‐energy plasma have reflectivity averaging 0.68% (300–700 nm). The super‐black color of plasma‐modified wood is retained when it is coated with gold/vanadium alloy indicating structural coloration. Plasma creates a low density, lignin‐enriched surface with deep pits, columns and tangled fibrils; features also found in synthetic super‐black materials. In conclusion, this method of creating a super‐black material by plasma‐modification of basswood does not require a lithography pre‐step, generates no liquid waste and, as is demonstrated here, can be used to prototype luxury consumer products.",

Herein, a critical spatial‐isolation strategy is demonstrated to separate the originally adjacent lithium metal and separator for higher safety and stability of lithium metal batteries by designing a Janus carbon fabric (CF) anode. Transferring lithium from the anode/separator interface to CF bottom shuts down the prerequisite of lithium dendrite formation, while the oversized lithium at CF bottom can be also used to compensate for the loss of lithium during the charge‐discharge cycling. As a result, the Janus CF//Li anode exhibits an ultralong cyclic life of 450 h at 2 mA cm −2 and &gt;250 h at 4 mA cm −2 , which significantly exceeds the common CF//Li anodes. Full cells coupling the Janus CF//Li anodes demonstrate longer cycle life (550 cycles) than that of the CF//Li anodes (450 cycles) at 1C, along with higher rate capability, and excellent cyclic stability at 2C. The remarkable results, as a proof of concept, signify the superior anode structure for improving both battery safety and cyclic stability for the realistic application of lithium metal batteries.",

Transient studies are performed to understand the surface chemistry of the interaction between methane and CO 2 in the presence of a catalyst, which results in a methane decomposition first to generate hydrogen and carbon and followed by a CO 2 reaction to give CO using deposited carbon. The experimental observations are further proven by mechanistic study with DFT calculations which show a major contribution of H‐assisted CO 2 dissociation and pre‐H 2 releasing carbon depositing CH 4 dissociation and a minor contribution of pre‐CO releasing H 2 formation. This MSI moves the d‐band center of the Co atoms of CoCuFeMnNi/CeO 2 to the closest position of the Fermi level as compared to the isolated nanoparticles.

However, the quality of high cost, complex manufacturing, and a small amount of synthetic materials is the main obstacle to large‐scale applications. Biological carbon‐based materials have a large and efficient heat exchange area due to the naturally abundant pore structure, which plays an important role in regulating convection and radiant heat loss. However, single‐component carbon materials have limited photothermal conversion performance, which limits their large‐scale application. In this work, tobacco stem (TS) organisms loaded with Co/CoO nanoparticles are successfully prepared by one‐step pyrolysis. The synergistic effect of Co/CoO nanostructures and biocarbon materials enhances water evaporation performance, widening the absorption range of the material across the entire solar spectrum, and expanding the range of energy that can be converted into heat. Specifically, the water evaporation rate and photothermal conversion efficiency of TS ‐Co/CoO (0.20) reached 2.22 kg m −2 h −1 and 139.4%, respectively, and its evaporation rate is 1.7 times the direct carbonized tobacco and 4.35 times the pure water.

    "abstract": "Abstract The properties of gelatin and collagen extracted from fishery wastes, specifically from mullet ( Mugil Cephalus ) scales, are modified with the aim to achieve biocompatible films with tunable characteristics to design sustainable UV protection solutions in the healthcare sector. Different additives are used to the scope including plasticizers, cross‐linkers, surfactants and optical modifiers. Carbon dots (CDs) obtained from seabass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) scales combined with polysorbate‐20 (PS) as a dispersant agent, enable the fabrication of materials capable of blocking UV radiation almost completely, a crucial feature for dermal contact applications. The addition of hydrophobic surfactants and crosslinkers as citric acid, chitosan and surface deacetylated chitin nanocrystals (CsNCs) allowed to modulate the water adsorption of the films in the range 3–30% and to reach a twofold and 4.5‐fold increase of tensile strength and elastic modulus, respectively, as compared to the neat gelatin film. Moreover, film thickness is shown to be another adjustable parameter to enhance optic, mechanical, and permeation properties: the higher the thickness, the greater the UV‐blocking properties, elongation‐at‐break and water vapor permeability, leading to films with attractive characteristics as wearable patches.",

Herein, a series of carbon‐rich, melon‐based photocatalysts are synthesized via one‐pot, temperature‐induced condensation of urea with the addition of a trace amount of citric acid. The addition of citric acid enhances crystallinity, extends melon chains, increases the C/N ratio, and improves π–π layer stacking of heptazine units, thereby enhancing charge transport properties and visible‐light harvesting capacity. These carbon nitride samples are then coupled with molten salt synthesized K 4 Nb 6 O 17 crystals by a straightforward self‐assembly method to construct 2D/2D heterostructure photocatalysts. Z‐scheme electron transfer from K 4 Nb 6 O 17 to the melon samples is established based on their work functions and band edge positions. This efficient charge transfer in the Z‐scheme heterostructure facilitates the spatial separation of charge carriers, resulting in a nearly fivefold enhancement in photocatalytic performance compared to the individual constituents.",

The high surface area and gas permeability of PIM‐1, combined with the chemical affinity and ion‐exchange properties of DBU‐imidazolate, contribute to enhanced CO 2 sensitivity and selectivity. The research objectives included the synthesis of PIM‐1 and DBU‐imidazolate, the preparation of composite membranes, and the evaluation of their performance as CO 2 sensors.

The PIM‐1/DBU‐imidazolate membrane exhibited high efficiency in CO₂ capture and release. Open circuit voltage (OCV) measurements are performed under varying concentrations of CO 2 exposure and cycles of adsorption/desorption. Results show that the membrane achieves steady state faster at higher CO 2 concentrations, with a logarithmic relationship between CO 2 concentration and voltage variation, indicating potential for CO 2 detection in human environments.

Through the integration of TiO 2 nanoparticles within a PLA matrix, the membrane is used to degrade ethanol as a model volatile organic compound (VOC) under UV light. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X‐ray Analysis (EDX), and UV–vis spectrophotometry confirm the porous structure of the membrane, the even distribution of TiO 2, and its effective band gap of 3.06 eV, respectively. Ethanol adsorption is best described by the Langmuir isotherm model, suggesting monolayer coverage on a homogeneous surface. Photocatalytic tests demonstrate that the membrane decomposes ethanol (6800 ppm) within 14 min under UV light, generating acetaldehyde, acetic acid, formaldehyde, and formic acid as intermediates, and ultimately producing CO 2 and water. Reusability tests indicate a decrease in decomposition time over successive cycles due to increased TiO 2 exposure from the gradual degradation of PLA. However, this degradation poses challenges for continuous use, compromising the membrane's long‐term durability.",

Flexible polymer‐based magneto‐mechano‐electric (MME) generators gain attention for their effectiveness in magnetic energy harvesting owing to their durability and flexibility. In this study, a lead‐free, flexible MME generator is developed by using Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)‐Aluminium nitride (AlN)‐nanofiber composites fabricated via electrospinning with different AlN compositions and integrated with a magnetostrictive Metglas layer that offers self‐bias characteristics. The MME generator is modeled using COMSOL Multiphysics to analyze the magnetic flux density distribution over the Metglas surface and the piezoelectric effect of the nanofiber composites, with the simulation results aligning well with the experimental data. The optimized, flexible MME generator, incorporating 15 wt.% of AlN in the PVDF/Metglas composite, achieves an open‐circuit voltage of 18.5 V and a power density of 0.93 mW‐cm −3 when exposed to an Alternating Current (AC) magnetic noise field of 6 Oe at a resonance frequency of 50 Hz. The generated power is sufficient to operate LEDs and sensor. This newly developed lead‐free, flexible MME generator shows significant promise for advanced applications in self‐powered WSNs.",

Bio‐based polyethylene (bio‐PE) is a key component of this transition, which is obtained from natural and renewable sources such as sugarcane. The environmental impact of bio‐PE and fossil‐based PE production is compared building ad‐hoc sustainability indicators while exploring environmental, social, economic, and energetic aspects to provide a comprehensive evaluation. This methodology involves analyzing the entire lifecycle of both processes for polyethylene production, from extraction/harvesting to post‐disposal actions, such as mechanical recycling or incineration. The main goal is to represent numerous sustainability indicators on a radar diagram, thus comparing process scores of sustainability. Bio‐PE production has significantly higher scores than fossil carbon PE in terms of global warming potential (from cradle‐to‐gate), safety, and contribution to ozone depletion. Additionally, bio‐PE offers a quite better scenario in terms of mass input and energy operating costs. On one side, bio‐PE exhibits similar potential of eutrophication and acidification; on the other side, it also guarantees almost same potential revenues. This can address the choice to the most sustainable post‐disposal method, that regards the mechanical separation and re‐introduction of end‐of‐life PE into the manufacturing process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Concern over the harmful impacts of pollutants on human health and the environment has increased in recent decades due to their widespread presence in water resources. These pollutants include pesticides, poisonous textile dyes, and micropollutants. It is essential to remove these pollutants from wastewater to enhance the quality of water for industrial usage. Because of externally hydrophilic and internally hydrophobic qualities, cyclodextrin and its derivatives have shown great promise as adsorbents for the treatment of wastewater. While cyclodextrins cannot be used as adsorbents on their own due to their water solubility, they can be efficiently polymerized with different types of cross‐linkers to increase their stability and effectiveness. This review article examines chemically crosslinked materials based on cyclodextrin and its derivatives, utilizing various cross‐linkers such as epichlorohydrin, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, N,N′‐methylene bisacrylamide and maleic anhydride. These materials are evaluated for their effectiveness in adsorbing textile dyes, micropollutants, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides from wastewater. Additionally, this article provides a detailed explanation of adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, and kinetic isotherms for the removal of contaminants. It also discusses the mechanism of contaminant adsorption, and reusability of adsorbents. Finally, this study delves into the challenges and exciting future prospects of CD‐based adsorbents, highlighting their potential to revolutionize wastewater treatment.",

In this study, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is innovatively employed as an encapsulation film on the surface of the wood‐based phase change material, resulting in a recyclable wood‐based composite energy storage material (PPW). A novel energy storage liquid (PCMs) composed of lauric acid (LA), capric acid (CA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) is immersed in the pretreated porous wood frame through vacuum impregnation. The PCMs imparted a phase change temperature of 21.0 °C, which is close to human comfort levels, and a high energy storage efficiency of 31.6 J g −1 to the PPW. Additionally, the PCMs provided the PPW with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 29.3%. Even after 200 freeze‐thaw cycles, the energy storage properties of the PPW remained nearly unchanged. Therefore, utilizing PMMA as an effective encapsulation material is a viable approach to prevent leakage of the phase change solution and enhance the recyclability of the PPW. Furthermore, the transparency of PMMA preserves the natural appearance of the wood, thereby broadening the application potential of PPW in residential buildings, thermal energy storage, and solar thermal conversion systems.",

One of the major obstacles to their recycling is the existence of impurities besides cellulose fiber in the biomass wastes. In this study, a fabrication method is investigated to upcycle biomass wastes directly into high‐performance aerogels without separation of impurities. Surprisingly, this study observes that residual impurities participate in cross‐linking reactions for the aerogel formation. In this study, zinc chloride salt hydrate is applied to convert biomass wastes to aerogel via a dissolution‐regeneration process. The fabricated aerogels exhibited high water absorption capacity (15 times its weight), as well as comparable mechanical strength and thermal insulation performance to the reported cellulose aerogels. In addition, the impurities (i.e., calcium‐based inorganic salt) assisted in the cross‐linking of the cellulose network for the aerogel formation. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the aerogel generated from the rejected fibers showed a honeycomb inner structure. The rejected fiber aerogels also demonstrated a high compressive modulus of 51 MPa and a low thermal conductivity of 0.029 W m −1 K −1 .

In this study, a bio‐based S cathode with graphene (Gr) coating, capable of effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides, is enabled via networking soy protein (SP) and polydopamine (PDA) to form a functional bio‐binder (SP‐PDA). Dopamine self‐polymerization in SP not only generates the interpenetrated network for the bio‐binder but also makes the denatured structure of SP with rich functional groups effective for trapping polysulfides. Meanwhile, the Gr coating with low impedance, and high electronic and ionic conductivity on the cathode surface further significantly reduces polysulfide dissolution. Consequently, the Li–S batteries with the bio‐cathode (SP‐PDA@Gr) demonstrate excellent rate performance and long cycling capacity. In specific, under the current density of 0.5 A g −1 at 70% (500 mAh g −1 ) capacity retention, the cycle life of the Li–S cell with SP‐PDA@Gr cathode is 600 cycles, i.e.,100 times longer than that of the cell with PVDF binder.

Several ion exchange membranes are analyzed, with a focus on proton exchange membranes (PEMs), that are the most mature membrane technology in RFBs, led by the gold standard Nafion. Key developments in the design of membranes include the synthesis of tailored (co)polymers, the post‐functionalization of commercially available ones, membrane formation techniques like electrospinning, polymer blending, the additions of organic and inorganic fillers, and surface modification. Dense, asymmetric and composite membranes are reported and discussed.

Correlations between chemical structure, properties and performance are discussed, targeting the trade‐off between conductivity, selectivity and overall performance of the RFB cell. Although significant steps forward in the development of ion‐conducting membranes were made, improvements in electrochemical properties and long‐term stability, while reducing costs, are still challenging and necessary to a large‐scale application of RFBs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A one‐step strategy to obtain a high‐performance catalyst from Cr(VI)‐containing wastewater by the photoreduction process is described. ZrO 2 is employed as a wide bandgap and high conduction‐band photocatalyst to reduce, capture, and immobilize Cr(VI) ions under UV light irradiation. The byproduct of this step is used as a catalyst for the CO 2 reverse water‐gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The total Cr content in water decreases to 0.0413 mg L −1 in 3 h, fulfilling the strictest wastewater standard. The soluble Cr(VI) species is converted into Cr(0) and Cr(III), and fixed on the ZrO 2 surface to form Cr@ZrO 2 as a byproduct with highly dispersed Cr species. Using this byproduct as a catalyst for the RWGS reaction results in almost thermal equilibrium conversion under 500 °C with 100% CO selectivity. This environment‐friendly and economic strategy is very promising for controlling heavy metal pollution and comprehensive CO 2 utilization.",

Earth‐abundant transition metal oxide like materials are synthesized and extensively studied in research laboratories to replace expensive IrO 2 and RuO 2 anodes for the oxygen evolution half reaction. However, pristine materials mined from the earth's crust are yet to be explored for such an application. Here the electrocatalytic activity of iron ore is investigated and a novel approach is reported to significantly improve its catalytic properties via formation of a nickel hydroxide layer on the surface. This electrocatalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at a low overpotential of 280 mV and maintains its activity for extended periods of electrolysis under alkaline conditions. This simple process to convert an abundant commodity into a value‐added product should be of considerable interest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wood residue (WR) is one of the most important biorenewable and sustainable resources, however, it is still a big challenge to directly use such hydrophilic resources to obtain thermoplastics by common thermoplasticization methods. Consequently, WR is usually used as fuel to produce heat or as fillers in furniture and decoration materials. Herein, a WR‐based sustainable thermoplastic with both good thermoplasticity and waterproof performance by grafting hydrophobic n ‐octanol side chains (IP‐8) onto the WR is reported. Thermoplasticity and waterproof mechanisms of the prepared thermoplastics are extensively evaluated. It is found for the first time that T g of the modified WR can be significantly reduced to 54 °C, which is much lower than the reported value (≈200 °C) of unmodified WR. T m peaks are evidently detected once the IP‐8 content exceeds 52.1 wt%, implying much better thermoplasticity in comparison with the unmodified WR. The good thermoplasticity and waterproof performance are mainly attributed to the formation of new crystal lamella with a crystallite size of ≈84 nm and hydrophobic spherical nanoparticles (150–350 nm). The developed method has large potential application in the fields of environmental‐friendly and sustainable macromolecular materials based on biomass resources like wood residue and plant straw.",

Herein, CS are produced by a green process utilizing microwave‐assisted hydrothermal treatment of cellulose. The CS are then postmodified in acidic and basic solutions to evaluate the influence of different functionalities on antibacterial properties. CS contain OH/COOH, CC, and CO functionalities, while O‐CS produced by acid treatment of CS have additional COOH, and NH/NH 2 groups, resulting in carbon spheres with negatively and positively charged groups in dispersion. Treatment with base (Na‐CS) removes low molecular weight species with oxygen and results in carbon spheres with the highest C/O ratio. CS, O‐CS, and Na‐CS have nonporous morphology and are in micro/nanometer sizes, although, smaller sized spheres, hollow spheres, and fragments are also attained in the case of O‐CS. O‐CS show antibacterial activity toward both Gram‐positive Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) and Gram‐negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ). The minimum inhibitory concentration is 200 and 400 µg mL −1 for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa , respectively, and is achieved only after 3 h of incubation. Neither CS nor Na‐CS exhibit antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity is suggested to originate from electrostatic interactions between O‐CS and the bacteria.",

The as‐prepared TiO 2 /C nanocomposite presents superior photocatalytic activity for organic pollutant degradation and excellent photo‐electrochemical performance.

In this context, protein‐based plastic materials may provide an alternative solution to this problem. These can be easily harvested and produced in a biodegradable form and, often produced from renewable resources. In this work, the use of jellyfish (JF)‐based biomass to produce plastics is suggested. This biomass comprises a significant amount of proteins such as Q‐mucin and collage that can be easily extracted by means of green technology. Also, there is a considerable need to use JF as a renewable resource since, during the last decades, JF has become an ecological disturbance worldwide. Here, a new route to exploit JF biomass to form biodegradable bioplastics is demonstrated. These materials are easy to produce, and their mechanical properties can be tuned by blending the JF biomass with biodegradable cross‐linkers that are also generated from renewable resources. Inspection of the plastics morphology reveals that it is composed of an unprecedented pseudospherulitic structure, which affects the materials' mechanical properties.",

Here, a facile and low‐cost approach is reported to fabricate biocompatible hydrogel filters with interconnected nanofiber network structures through the use of high aspect ratio, wood‐derived nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC). The super‐hydrophilia and high porosity of these materials endow the NFC hydrogel filters (NFC‐HFs) with high solvent permeance. Nanofibrous networks and interconnected nanoporous structures of NFC‐HFs promote efficient rejection and precise size‐selective separation of nanoparticles. Specifically, small and irregular nanopores of NFC‐HFs fail to match the size of relatively large nanoparticles, which ensures a relatively stable flux of the NFC‐HFs over the whole filtration process, even under continuous filtration of highly concentrated nanoparticle solutions.",

Nevertheless, the bottleneck in this field is how to develop SCs with low electrical resistance and high energy density. Herein, an ingenious strategy to integrate wind power harvesting and asymmetric wire‐shaped SCs (WSSCs) has been put forward for the first time. Remarkably, the asymmetric WSSCs are realized by using vertical FeOOH and CoNi 2 S 4 nanosheet‐array‐coated flexible carbon fibers as negative and positive yarn electrodes, in which a vertically oriented and cross‐linked porous network, formed by electroactive nanosheet arrays, facilitates ionic diffusion and charge transport. Benefiting from an intriguing configuration, these asymmetric WSSCs, with superior flexibility and weavability, act as efficient energy storage devices, which exhibit low resistance, high volumetric energy density (3.2 mWh cm ‐3 ), and strong durability (91.2% after 20 000 cycles). As a result, two serial WSSCs with a high voltage of 3 V can be effectively recharged, by harvesting a sustainable wind source, and repeatedly supplying power to the lamp without decline of electrochemical performance. Therefore, this work throws light on a new avenue for the development of sustainable energy harvesting and wearable energy storage.",

This coincided with an increase in sustainable land‐use practices such as conservation agriculture no‐till (103%), reduced tillage (71%), and cover cropping (123%) which are most popular among large‐scale growers. Manure application also increased by 30%. However, there were reductions in other practices such as intensive tillage (−9%), use of commercial fertilizers (−0.2%), nematicides (−63%), and chemical diseases control (−16%).

Previous studies identified that defect‐free graphene monolayers cannot be adopted as lithium‐ion battery anodes. Approaches, such as functionalization and introducing defects in graphene, have been employed to improve its performance in energy storage. However, defects in graphene boost dendrite growth, resulting in safety issues and fast power losses in batteries. Herein, by adopting state‐of‐the‐art first‐principles calculations, orbital theory, and transition state theory, it is found that defect‐free graphene monolayers are a promising potassium‐ion battery (KIB) anodes, however, they cannot be employed as lithium‐/sodium‐/magnesium‐/calcium‐/zinc‐/aluminum‐ion battery anodes. The evidence of adsorption energy and electron transfer indicates that van der Waals interactions dominate the adsorption of K atoms while delocalized electrons neutralize repulsion between K ions. The KIB anode delivers a high capacity of 1487.7 mA h g −1 and ultrafast charging/discharging rates. Transition state theory results demonstrate that its ultrahigh classic diffusion constants achieve 2.36 × 10 11 /1.55 × 10 9 s −1 , its Wigner zero‐point‐energy‐/tunneling‐corrected diffusion constants approach 2.38 × 10 11 /1.56 × 10 9 s −1 , and its low quantum‐mechanical tunneling effects are 0.67%/0.72% under the low/high concentration diffusion of K ions at room temperature.

Consequently, solar energy must sit at the center of the water–energy–climate nexus as the world is shifting into a decarbonized and circular economy. Simultaneous production of electricity and fresh water by photovoltaic‐membrane distillation (PV‐MD), a newly developed technology, turns waste heat from solar PV panels into a power source to drive an efficient water distillation process. It produces fresh and clean potable‐quality water on‐site from various water sources with impaired quality, such as seawater, contaminated rivers, lakes, groundwater, and industrial wastewater. Due to the low barrier of entry, it is well suited to providing both electricity and fresh water in decentralized manner for point‐of‐consumption locations, especially off‐grid communities and communities with small‐ to medium‐sized populations even with challenging economic conditions. This essay highlights the potential of PV‐MD to supply decentralized water and electricity for regions suffering from both economic and physical water scarcity as well as its promise to contribute to agriculture in (semi)arid regions.",

In general, the synthesis of most of the available CO 2 sorbents is not ecofriendly and can require multistep synthesis in order to prepare and/or activate, which is considered a strict violation of green chemistry principles (GCPs). Therefore, thinking of green frameworks to design chemical products and processes becomes essential to mitigate these challenges. This paper provides an in‐depth review of available green sorbents for CO 2 capture with an emphasis on those prepared from biorenewable materials and ionic liquids. A new metric is presented to classify these sorbents based on their degree of compliance to the GCPs, which could be a useful tool in selection of green alternatives. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this research topic, a wide range of literature is available in multiple areas including but not limited to chemistry and engineering. Hence, this review targets a wide range of scientists including chemists, biotechnologists, material scientists, and meteorologists, as well as green industrial corporations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Electrochemical hydrogen storage combines the evolution, oxidation, and storage of hydrides from aqueous electrolytes and ionic liquids, but presently requires palladium or rare‐earth metals to achieve significant power capacities. Here hydrogen electrosorption in amine‐activated polydopamine is shown. The organic heterogeneous amine‐hydride yields a gravimetric hydrogen density of 0.44%, corresponding to a 80% hydride‐per‐monomer content, and offers similar reaction kinetics as for palladium and related systems. An initial stability test of 100 electrosorption cycles that demonstrates resilience in acidic media with a tendency for increased capacity over time is included. In situ vibronic amine‐hydride fingerprints corroborate the reversibility and stability of the conversion process and highlight the merits of amine‐activated polydopamines as a heterogeneous organic hydrogen storage system.",

Lignin melts serve as the solvent itself under HDO conditions. Activated carbon supported NiMoS 2 catalysts are prepared by a water/oil micro–emulsion method and the required support acidity is tailored by addition of ZrO 2 (10–50%) to the support. The maximum deoxygenation of 82.2% is observed along with a monomer yield of 69.1% in 3 h reaction time, when 10% ZrO 2 is added to the carbon support. The yield of monomers is distributed in the following order: alkyl phenolics (23.1%) &gt; guaiacolics (18.1%) &gt; aromatic hydrocarbons (17.5%) &gt; alkanes (10.5%). Interestingly, aromatic hydrocarbons yield increases with increase in time. The catalyst is found to be stable, without any significant loss in the activity and product selectivity when tested for up to five reaction cycles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The recovery of waste heat is urgently required to solve challenging energy and environmental issues. Thermomagnetic generation (TMG) technology using magnetic phase transition materials can realize the conversion of low‐grade waste heat into electrical energy. However, efficient TMG materials hold the key to the development of this technology. Herein, the TMG performance of La(Fe, Si) 13 H y /In is studied in comparison with the benchmark material Gd systematically. The induced current I is related to the change rate of the average magnetization over time d M /d t according to Faraday's law. In addition, the location of T C in the working temperature range is an important factor affecting TMG performance. Due to the sharper magnetic transition, La(Fe, Si) 13 H y /In presents a maximum intrinsic I of 9.12 µA g −1 , ≈90% higher than that of Gd (4.82 µA g −1 ). Moreover, the average output electrical power density and cost performance of La(Fe, Si) 13 H y /In are 0.42 mW m −3 and 0.102 nW USD −1 , which are also significantly higher than those of Gd, 0.10 mW m −3 and 0.005 nW USD −1 , respectively. In comparison with Gd, the present work suggests that the La(Fe, Si) 13 H y /In possesses much higher potential in the field of low‐grade waste heat recovery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Electronic products contain a wide range of materials including pure metals and alloys, ceramics, and polymers. Disassembling each individual component of such products to recycle is impossible. For that reason, end‐of‐life electronic products like waste printed circuit boards (WPCB) are shredded and sent to pyrometallurgical processes to recover valuable metals. One major issue with recycling is the release of gaseous brominated species that need to be captured or stabilized. It is crucial to have a fundamental understanding of the chemical interactions that occur between each component of the WPCB in these processes. The thermal degradation mechanism of WPCB is investigated here using differential scanning calorimetry coupled to thermogravimetric analysis of both synthetic samples and shredded WPCB. Computational thermochemistry is used to support the identified reaction mechanisms which involve the release of gaseous hydrogen bromide evolving from Tetrabromobisphenol A used as a flame retardant. The chemical reactivity between this compound and each major WPCB component is quantified. It is proven that HBr(g) reacts with copper, iron, and CaO to form bromides which stay in the solid pyrolysis residue up to a temperature of 580 °C. Above this temperature, CuBr 2 and FeBr 2 start to evaporate and are lost in the gas phase.",

By a facile H 2 S plasma treatment on Ag foil and subsequent electrochemical prereduction, Ag/Ag 2 S nanowire clusters are obtained in situ with different sizes. High Faradaic efficiency for CO generation on Ag/Ag 2 S is shifted to a significantly lower overpotential compared with untreated Ag foil with high current density. Density functional theory studies reveal that the promoted catalytic activity can be ascribed to the enhanced CO 2 activation and reduced reaction energy barrier of the limiting step.",

In this study, for the first time, highly stable colloidal dispersions of Bi/BiOCl x Br 1− x heterojunction with an exposed (001) facet are successfully prepared from inorganic simple salts using low‐frequency ultrasound irradiation (LFUI) at ambient conditions without further post‐treatment. The colloidal dispersion series of Bi/BiOCl x Br 1− x heterojunction ( x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1) is simply obtained by adding stoichiometric aqueous solutions of NaCl and NaBr, into an acidic aqueous solution of Bi(NO) 3 .5H 2 O in a typical ultrasonication bath at room temperature within ≈5 min. Bi/BiOCl x Br 1− x heterojunction films are also fabricated using a simple drop‐casting technique and tested as immobilized photocatalytic reactors. Compared to its counterparts, the Bi/BiOCl 0.8 Br 0.2 film possesses a 3D flower‐like morphology with a highly exposed (001) facet showing the highest electron‐hole generation and separation efficiencies. In addition, the Bi/BiOCl 0.8 Br 0.2 film demonstrates the highest photocatalytic degradation rate of the rhodamine RhB aqueous solutions (≈5 ppm), achieving ≈99% in 60 min under the visible light component of the solar spectrum.

Edible packaging films may be consumed with the food or beverage that they hold since they are made from edible components derived from plants and animals. Even if they are not consumed, they disintegrate quickly, significantly reducing the waste disposal problem. In this work, karaya dialdehyde (KDA) with a variable aldehyde content is effectively produced through the periodate oxidation of gum karaya and subsequently used as an eco‐friendly crosslinking agent for edible gelatin films. Chemical crosslinking between the gelatin protein chains is generated when KDA is added, producing a water‐stable film. The mechanical properties are found to be significantly improved as a result of the covalent bonding between the two polymers. Excessive oxidation, on the other hand, has a detrimental effect on the film properties. Despite the crosslinking, the films are biodegradable, suggesting that composite films made in an environmentally benign manner in an aqueous media using polymers derived from biosources may be utilizable in the edible film‐based packaging sector.",

Driven by this issue, in the current study, to counteract the restacking behavior, graphene sheets are supported on a thread/rod‐like matrix structure in a boron nitride foam material, and a novel porous composite foam‐supported graphene is synthesized. The as‐prepared novel composite offers extraordinary features, such as high absorption kinetics, large available surface area, high porosity (&gt;98%), ecofriendliness and cost‐effective synthesis, and excellent affinity to emerging pharmaceutical contaminants. When batch‐testing graphene‐based foam material and porous graphene nanosheets to remove gemfibrozil (GEM) from wastewater samples, rapid adsorption kinetics (&lt;5 min) are exhibited by the graphene‐based foam. Column filter studies are conducted for both materials to test their performance in removing GEM from distilled water, synthetic graywater, and actual wastewater. Overall, the foam composite‐based filter marginally outperforms the sand‐supported graphene filter and significantly outperforms the unsupported graphene filter. A numerical MATLAB model is developed to simulate the reactive solute transport of GEM influent through the foam filter. Also, a formal sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the key parameters influencing the model results.",

The alloying of cost‐effective bismuth with platinum is found to be much more efficient than that with palladium for the boosting of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Interestingly, Pt‐rich Pt‐Bi structures with irregular‐shaped thin morphologies are more suitable for HER, whereas cubic‐like Pt‐Bi nanostructures prove to be better catalysts for the ORR. The higher mass activity of Pt‐Bi alloys in ORR than that of pure Bi and Pd‐Bi alloys as well as the low HER overpotentials, which are comparable with benchmark 10% Pt/C catalysts, are attributed to synergistic effects, due to the coexistence and satisfactory degree of alloying between both metals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The demand for improved indoor air quality has grown with improvements in the standards of living worldwide. While wood is widely used to construct furniture since it is a renewable resource and aesthetically pleasing, it is also flammable, which limits its applications. Although there have been extensive research efforts in reducing the flammability of wood products, current approaches often have adverse effects on the environment. In this work, a novel organo‐inorganic coordination system is proposed to prepare a fire‐retardant and smoke suppression wooden “air purifier” using a vacuum impregnation method. The “air purifier” is composed of tourmaline particles/KH550 (TPs/KH550) and delignified wood. The added TPs give the final composites capable to purify air (1000 psc cm −3 negative oxygen ions [NOIs]). Compared with pristine wood (PW), total heat release (THR), peak heat release rate (HRR), and smoke production rate (SPR) of the wooden “air purifier” are reduced by 47.88%, 11.73%, and 82.81%, respectively, highlighting that the composites have good fire‐retardancy and smoke suppression performances. Life cycle assessment (LCA) results indicate the composites have minimal environmental impact (EI) in 15 categories. This green, eco‐friendly wooden “air purifier” with fire‐retardant and smoke suppression properties has a great potential application in furniture and buildings.",

Repurposing plastic wastes for sustainable energy is a promising approach to mitigate the plastic pollution problem. In this study, plastic waste‐derived activated carbon (PWC) is synthesized from nonrecyclable waste and used as a cathode material in lithium–selenium (Li–Se) batteries and zinc‐ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHCs). Increasing the activation temperature (500–800 °C) enhances the specific surface area and pore volume and tailors the porous structure of PWC toward larger pore sizes. PWC activated at lower temperatures with potassium hydroxide (KOH) shows better performance as the Se host in Li–Se batteries due to their microporous structure for effective Se confinement. Se cathode based on PWC activated at 600 °C (PWC600/Se) delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 655.2 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C over 150 cycles. PWC activated at 800 °C (PWC800) possesses the largest surface area of 2328.2 m 2 g −1 and is thus used to fabricate cathode electrodes for ZHCs.

Glucose oxidase (GOD) is served as the template to construct the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) with N‐isopropylacrylamide (NiPAAm) as the thermo‐sensitive monomer. The prepared MIP film electrodes demonstrate reversible GOD‐, temperature‐, and glucose‐sensitive on‐off electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behaviors toward luminol. Moreover, the addition of ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (Fc(COOH) 2 ) into the luminol solution can enhance the ECL signal of the system and produce cyclic voltametric (CV) signals at GOD‐free MIP film electrodes. Based on these experiments, a 4‐input/5‐output biomolecular logic gate is established with GOD, temperature, glucose and Fc(COOH) 2 as inputs and the simultaneous ECL and CV responses as outputs. On the same platform, some functional non‐Boolean logic devices such as encoder, decoder and demultiplexer are also constructed. In particular, a 3‐input/3‐output biomolecular keypad lock with resettability and reprogrammability is built based on this enzymatically imprinted polymer film electrodes for the first time. This work may provide a new avenue to realize more complex and efficient enzymatic logic calculation with a simple platform, and can further expand this system in biomolecular recognition and bioinformation storage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polymer‐electrolyte‐membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) face the challenges like slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics and limited mass transport at high current densities, which affects their performance. The efficient water removal from the cathode is essential to improve oxygen diffusion. Addressing this, a catalyst is presented with platinum (Pt) nanoparticles distributed within a 3D carbon network (Pt/3DPDC) derived from the polydopamine‐coated melamine foam. This unique architecture enhances Pt utilization and water management due to its high porosity and ample free spaces, providing a process‐friendly feature for the electrode under PEMFC conditions. The pores and accessible texture of the 3D polydopamine derived carbon (3DPDC) framework facilitate ionomer uptake during the electrode fabrication, extending the active triple‐phase boundary and improving the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) performance. The high porosity of Pt/3DPDC is mitigated by adding a small amount of commercial fuel cell catalayst (Pt/C), which maintains the effective catalyst number density per unit area by utilizing the excess porosity of the 3DPDC framework. This controlled interplay of the unique catalyst structure and spatially confined distribution of Pt/C within the Pt/3DPDC framework offers fast activation, reduced electrode flooding, and improved current densities across the operating potential window. This carefully engineered catalyst, designed through bottom‐up strategies, is a promising electrocatalyst for practical PEMFC applications.",

However, components such as N 2 , O 2 , SO x , NO x , and H 2 O in flue gas can hinder ERC efficiency, affecting catalyst stability and selectivity. This study systematically investigates the effect of these flue gas components on a metallic Bi dendrite catalyst. The catalyst shows remarkable stability (over 6 days are observed with constant current generation) surpassing other monometallic Bi catalysts. The active state of the catalyst has been demonstrated with o perando XANES (X‐ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) analysis which has confirmed the metallic state of bismuth and notably, the catalyst performance remains unaffected despite the presence of other flue gas components such as N 2 , O 2 , SO x , and NO x .

    "abstract": "Abstract The chemical and physical stability of bio‐hydrogels are of utmost interest to avoid the premature degradation of the polymer and to favor cyclic material operations (i.e., material recovery and re‐using). In this work, the stability of different alginate hydrogels semi‐interpenetrated with poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate conducting polymer (Alg/PEDOT), which acts as a photothermal absorber is examined. More specifically, the behavior of Alg/PEDOT hydrogels ionically and covalently crosslinked with Ca 2+ ions and glyoxal, respectively, has been compared when used as water purification platforms. The homogenous porosity and higher cycling capacity of the glyoxal‐crosslinked gels provide superior performance for water‐steam generation under sunlight irradiation than that of the ionically stabilized gel. Furthermore, increasing the glyoxal cross‐linking reaction time prove to have little effect on the porosity and the efficiency of freshwater supply from an artificial seawater solution. Covalent cross‐links provide thermal absorber (PEDOT:PSS) retention capacity in artificial seawater, which is critical to maintaining such efficiency with the increasing number of purification cycles. This research opens new frontiers to promote the use of alginate biopolymer in chemical engineering processes such as water desalination, directly addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for Clean Water &amp; Life on Land.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity is crucial for advancing solid lithium‐ion battery technology but is still a challenge. In this study, the ionic conductivity of NASICON‐structured materials Li 3 (Zr,Ti) 2 (Si,Ge) 2 PO 12 are explored through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This investigation reveals the significant impact of isovalent substitution on the lithium‐ion diffusion pathways and the associated energy barriers. Elemental substitutions, such as replacing Zr with Ti, significantly reduce the Li site energy levels, enhance the polyhedral volume, and change the coordination structure from four‐coordinate to five‐coordinate, thereby facilitating lithium‐ion migration. Conversely, substituting Si with Ge reduces the diffusion channel size and increases fluctuation of Li migration potential surface, leading to less favorable ion transport conditions. Li 3 Ti 2 Si 2 PO 12 exhibits a room temperature ionic conductivity of 5.79 × 10 −2 Scm −1 , 163% higher than that of the pristine Li 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 , with a reduced diffusion barrier of 0.16 eV. Additionally, these analyses reveal that the critical size for effective diffusion channels is vital: below this threshold, ion migration is suppressed; while above it, the channel size no longer limits migration.",

However, inorganic materials can pose environmental risks due to toxicity and low sustainability properties, which may lead to pollution after intended use. To address these limitations, sustainable organic nanozyme‐based sensing platforms are essential for overcoming sustainable issues and effectively detecting toxic agrichemicals. In this study, a second‐generation, sustainable organic compound‐based nanozyme (EU nanozyme) is introduced, which exhibits peroxidase‐like catalytic activity. The nanozyme is synthesized using a modified, self‐assembled fabrication procedure that produced a homogenous, spherical nanozyme within 2 h and incorporated a partially mimicked cofactor of the natural peroxidase. This EU nanozyme exhibits decent kinetic profiles ( Km = 0.006 m m , H 2 O 2 ), along with degradability and biocompatibility, making it suitable for direct implementation in agricultural environments and highlighting its sustainability. The EU nanozyme‐based colorimetric sensing platform effectively detects toxic herbicides (e.g., Atrazine), with decent analytic sensitivity with a Limit of Detection (LOD) of 0.231 pg mL −1 , strong analytic selectivity among more than six relative agrichemicals/and other pesticides, and specificity in corn samples with a LOD of 0.394 µgmL −1 , within a short detection time of up to 3 min.

    "abstract": "Abstract Water electrolysis represents the primary method to produce green hydrogen. Nevertheless, during water electrolysis, particularly at high current densities, a large number of gas bubbles generated are difficult to detach from the electrode, triggering a series of negative effects such as active site covering, ionic conductance block, and catalyst deactivation, which in turn reduces catalyst efficiency. In recent years, flexible electrocatalysts have been developed to address this issue well, with the superior characteristics including mechanical deformability, active site optimization, high mass transfer efficiency, and structural stability. The advanced development of flexible electrocatalyst engineering for water electrolysis is urgently needed to be systematically reviewed. Here, first, the characteristics of flexible electrocatalysts are summarized to deeply understand their impact on water electrolysis performance. Second, a series of strategies to design flexible electrocatalysts based on 2D nanosheets and fern‐like structure are comprehensively introduced. Last but not least, the outlooks of flexible electrocatalyst research is presented, which will provide a preliminary theoretical basis and new ideas for the development of low‐cost, high‐performance, and long‐life electrocatalysts applied to water electrolysis.",

The nanocomposites are subjected to multiple recycling cycles using a solvent casting method, and their electrical and electromechanical properties are thoroughly analyzed. Microstructural characterization revealed improved nanoparticle dispersion with recycling, albeit with distinct behavior for CNT and GNP due to differences in aspect ratio and geometry. Electrical tests demonstrated a reduction in conductivity for CNT‐based sensors due to nanoparticle breakage, while GNP‐based sensors exhibited stable conductivity. Electromechanical tests indicated enhanced sensitivity after recycling, with GNP‐based sensors showing superior robustness. Proof‐of‐concept tests, including monitoring knee joint movements and breathing patterns, validated the functionality of recycled sensors in health monitoring applications.

Traditionally made from petroleum‐derived polymers, these materials typically demand high energy for production, generate considerable dust during mixing components, have poor fire resistance, and degrade slowly. To address these issues, this work proposes a sustainable alternative using microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) and carbon black (CB) to create conductive cryogels by the freeze‐drying method. The dispersibility of CB in aqueous suspensions of cationic or anionic MFC is studied, and the interactions between components are evaluated using advanced techniques, showing stronger interactions between CB and cationic cellulose. Also, the effect of CB content is assessed on the cryogels’ morphological, mechanical, and electrical properties. Results show cryogels with low densities (&lt;55 mg cm −3 ), high porosities (&gt;91%), strong network structures with high specific compression moduli (11–21 MPa cm 3 g −1 ), and superior fire resistance. Electrical properties vary with CB content: 1–5 wt% CB results in static‐dissipative behavior (≈10 8 Ω cm), while ≥10 wt% CB forms a conductive network (10 3 –10 1 Ω cm). Overall, cationic MFC/CB cryogels exhibit promising properties, suggesting the potential for replacing plastic‐based antistatic foams in electrical applications as a greener alternative.",

The study evaluates the net cooling power, radiative forcing (RF), and global warming potential of different RC materials compared to conventional construction and roofing materials, Earth's natural surfaces, and some reference cases. Key parameters for evaluating the above‐mentioned structures include their solar reflectance (albedo) and long‐wavelength infrared emissivity. Results show the cooling power that can be achieved by an ideal RC material with a solar reflectance of 100% and long‐wave infrared emissivity of 100% is 164.8 W·m −2 . In practice, materials exhibiting a cooling power as high as 160.8 W·m −2 are fabricated. Further analysis shows if 1% of Earth's surface are to be covered with this material the terrestrial RF will decrease by 1.61 W·m −2 (from 0.6 to −1.01 W·m −2 ). The results demonstrate that RC materials with high solar reflectivity and emissivity offer substantial cooling benefits and can reduce RF when implemented on large scales. The findings underscore the effectiveness of RC materials in reducing global warming and provide a valuable perspective on their role in reducing the environmental impacts of the built environment.",

However, the rate and low‐temperature performances are poor due to the terrible dynamics of the S cathode. Herein, a four‐electrode Li‐S cell integrated with an electrothermal interlayer is designed to realize the internal heating. An electrothermal interlayer composed of Li 1.3 Al 0.3 Ti 1.7 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP) and carbon nanotube (CNT) is prepared and displays fast, uniform, and adjustable heating ability under applied voltages of 15‐30 V. The interlayer is also conducive to improving the wetting ability and thermal stability of the separator. Meanwhile, the Li + ion conductivity and transfer number of the in situ polymerized electrolyte are enhanced after integrating the interlayer, especially at high temperatures.",

However, their limited air stability and poor lithium compatibility impede the practical application in all‐solid‐state lithium batteries. Herein, a series of Li 6 P 1− x Nb x S 5−2.5 x O 2.5 x Cl ( x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1) solid electrolytes are synthesized by co‐doping Nb and O in Li 6 PS 5 Cl electrolyte, showing simultaneously enhanced ionic conductivity, air stability, and interfacial compatibility with lithium. Benefitting from the substitution of P 5+ with a larger radius Nb 5+ , the powder cold‐pressed ionic conductivity of Li 6 P 0.95 Nb 0.05 S 4.875 O 0.125 Cl electrolyte reaches up to 4.19 mS cm −1 at room temperature. Moreover, the amount of H 2 S released by Li 6 P 0.95 Nb 0.05 S 4.875 O 0.125 Cl electrolyte is only half of the original electrolyte under a moist atmosphere with 30% relative humidity for 30 min, demonstrating improved moisture stability.

Departing from these conventional strategies, an innovative method aimed at augmenting thermal insulation and eco‐friendliness of building structures is proposed, which involves the integration of nanoclay (NC) hydrogel to confer multifunctionality upon cement materials. Within the hydrogel matrix, NC functions as an internal cross‐linking agent, establishing robust bonds with cement through a surface pozzolanic reaction. Rigorous validation of this interaction is conducted through meticulous adhesion measurements, assessments of changes in bonding energy, and simulations of shear forces. Significantly, the bonded NC hydrogel, enriched with water, demonstrates a remarkable ability to supply essential moisture for the successful settlement and growth of aquatic organisms and moss. This comprehensive study underscores the potential of NC hydrogel as an invaluable material for establishing the foundations of thriving ecosystems, presenting a promising avenue for sustainable construction practices.",

This study presents groundbreaking research on the mechanical recycling of brominated acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) derived from real post‐consumer WEEE. It evaluates the effectiveness of BFR extraction and explores the feasibility of simulating injection overmolding using the debrominated polymer. The extraction process achieves BFR removal rates exceeding 94%, reducing the final BFR content, mainly those identified as persistent organic pollutants (BFR‐POPs), to below 50 ppm, thus complying with Directive 2019/1021/EU. Compared to virgin ABS (vABS), the debrominated ABS maintains its physico‐chemical characteristics with increased elastic modulus, stress at yield, and stress at break, although impact toughness is reduced. Moldflow simulations reveal that the polymer interface temperature and duration above ABS's glass transition temperature are insufficient for optimal polymer chain auto‐diffusion. To maximize interlayer adhesion, both mold and material temperatures must be increased. These findings confirm the technical feasibility of BFR removal and reuse of ABS in value‐added applications, contributing to sustainable material development and circular economy objectives for WEEE plastics.",

To improve the sensitivity and stability of copper‐based electrodes for nitrate detection, the ultra‐high conductivity graphene foam developed by the group is utilized as a supporting electrode for copper. By increasing the surface roughness of the graphene foam, its binding interaction with copper is enhanced, which significantly improved electron transfer efficiency and stability in the composite electrode during electrochemical nitrate detection. Concretely, the roughened graphene foam surface promotes the formation of a dense copper layer and a higher content of Cu(OH) 2 as well as oxygen defects, which enhances nitrate adsorption and further improves detection sensitivity. The resulting composite electrode achieves an impressive detection limit of 1.78 µ m . This study demonstrates that optimizing the surface roughness of graphene foam can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of composite electrodes, offering valuable insights for the design and development of next‐generation, highly active composite electrodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water scarcity and environmental pollution represent dual crises that impede global sustainable development. Population growth, industrial activities, and climate change have driven an increase in freshwater demand, while industrial wastewater, agricultural runoff, and the discharge of emerging contaminants have exacerbated water pollution. These challenges urgently require innovative technologies for resolution. Solar‐driven interfacial evaporation and photocatalytic technologies offer promising solutions; however, research on their integration within single‐material systems remains limited. This work presents a novel approach to combine interfacial evaporation and photocatalytic functions in TiO 2 ‐Fe 2 O 3 ceramics, synthesized via vacuum sintering at 600 °C. The incorporation of Fe 2 O 3 enhances the sinterability of the material, enabling the retention of the anatase phase of TiO₂ while significantly lowering the sintering temperature. Compared to pure TiO 2 ceramics, the TiO 2 ‐Fe 2 O 3 ceramics exhibit a solar absorption rate of 87.74%, nearly double that of pure TiO 2 ceramics (43.29%). Furthermore, the water evaporation rate is increased from 0.7 to 1.34 kg m − 2 h −1 . Additionally, the optimized oxygen‐deficient anatase TiO 2 structure demonstrates superior photocatalytic performance compared to ceramics sintered at higher or lower temperatures. This work proposes a low‐temperature strategy for fabricating multifunctional TiO 2 ‐Fe 2 O 3 ceramics, integrating interfacial evaporation and photocatalysis, providing an efficient and sustainable solution for addressing water scarcity and environmental pollution.",

The process transforms CO₂ and H₂ into methane and water under low‐temperature methanation conditions. This study suggests a new way to improve the performance of a microchannel reactor by combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD), response surface methodology (RSM), machine learning (ML), and multi‐objective optimization. Key design variables include inlet velocity, temperature, and channel length ratios. The RSM approach is for generating datasets for simulation; while, data augmentation assists ML model training. Six ML models—linear, ensemble, tree, Gaussian, support vector machine (SVM), and neural networks are evaluated for regression accuracy against RSM‐based correlation. The Gaussian process model is found superior and integrated with a multi‐objective optimization algorithm. A decision‐making score (DMS) levels and normalizes performance indicators. It finds the best reactor designs with CO₂ conversion rates of ≈78.6% and CH₄ selectivity close to 99.9%. These results demonstrate an advanced approach for significantly reducing computational demand (24 h to 1.471 ms) against CFD simulations; while, maintaining accuracy, thereby enabling cost‐effective, efficient solutions for reactor design optimization across various engineering applications in real‐world PtG applications.",

Anthropogenic activities are often a source of contamination for water and, among the pollutants released, potentially toxic elements (PTEs) represent a well‐known hazard to human health and ecosystem safety. In this study, carboxymethylcellulose‐alginate (HY‐ACMC), methacrylated‐chitosan (HY‐MCHI), and methacrylated‐gelatine (HY‐MGEL) hydrogels are synthesized, characterized, and tested as sorbents for PTEs removal. The removal efficiency is significantly affected by pH and contaminants’ concentration. Furthermore, experiments in real aquaculture samples from Italy and Denmark farms are carried out to evaluate the matrix effect. Finally, hydrogel regeneration is optimized and sorbent efficiency for multiple cycles of water remediation treatment is investigated. All tested materials show promising removal capabilities even in real water. HY‐ACMC has proven to be the most effective for single‐cycle remediation treatments thanks to its high performance in all the studied conditions, although it is unstable to regeneration. On the other hand, regeneration with Na 2 EDTA improves HY‐MCHI efficiency, granting its prolonged employment over time. Considering both performances in real water samples and reusability results, HY‐MGEL seems to be the most reliable material for multiple cycles of water remediation treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Foam‐formed nonwoven materials have recently experienced a surge in popularity, but research focuses on flexible fibres with scant information on rigid particles. This work showcases how rigid, minimally‐processed, macroporous wood microparticles work synergistically with the foam‐forming method to offer a robust manufacturing strategy that is insensitive to feedstock and water quality. Lightweight oven‐dried foams suitable for rigid thermal insulation are produced using four types of wood residue and can be made using ocean water instead of ultrapure water. The bio‐based content in the foam can be increased by partially/fully replacing the polymer binder with mechanical pulp or using a biosurfactant. For the 15 foams produced with slightly modulated compositions, the densities are low (90–130 kg m −3 ), the thermal conductivities are low (38–45 mW m −1 K −1 ), and many meet ASTM insulation standards for compressive strength. Pilot plant scaling produced large‐scale (100×50×4 cm) foam boards. The structure‐property relationships elucidated offer new guidelines to optimize foam performance by matching microparticle size to bubble size, having a distribution of microparticle lengths, and preserving wood's natural macroporous character. This work demonstrates how to harness the functionality that nature has already engineered for plants in the design of novel, sustainable and advanced bioproducts.",

However, AZIBs still suffer from the hydrogen evolution reaction, Zn dendrite and Zn corrosion, which are closely correlated with Zn 2+ solvation structure. Therefore, designing an optimized Zn 2+ solvation structure with reduced water molecules in the solvation shell is expected to achieve stable and reversible Zn 2+ plating/stripping. In this study, water‐soluble Tartaric Acid containing abundant ─COOH groups as electrolyte additive for AZIBs is employed. The dissociated ─COOH can replace water molecules around Zn 2 ⁺, leading to a restructured solvation shell, which not only inhibits side reactions, but also enhances the kinetics of de‐solvation process, promoting the formation of a flat and dense zinc deposition layer. The as‐prepared Zn electrode exhibits an impressive areal capacity of 28.21 mAh cm −2 after resting 6 h and excellent long‐term stability (800 cycles with capacity retention of 81.76%). In addition, in situ microscope and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) synergistically identify the outstanding structural stability and enhanced kinetics, respectively.

In this study, different phases of titanium oxide, including TiO 2 , TiO, and Ti 2 O, are developed using the Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) technique. Notably, a novel Ti 2 O electride with a pbcn space group is identified, and variations in stoichiometries, such as Ti 1.80 O, Ti 2.05 O, and Ti 2.30 O, are observed through Rietveld analysis of the corresponding X‐ray Diffraction (XRD) data. High‐resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging further revealed line defects such as stacking faults and edge dislocations in Ti 2 O. The interplay of stoichiometric defects in Ti 2 O electrides leads to tunable electrocatalytic behavior, enabling transitions from oxygen evolution to hydrogen evolution reactions. Importantly, using Density functional theory (DFT), Paterson analysis, and Fourier electron density mapping, the exceptional metallic properties of Ti 2 O are rationalized as arising from its unique spatial electron density distribution. Overall, this work underscores the significance of atomic‐level structure engineering and opens the door to a new class of titanium oxide catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.",

Nevertheless, in the pathway of photocatalytic H₂O₂ production, there are still a series of negative issues, such as the insufficient supply of protons, difficulty in separating the electron–hole pair, and low utilization of spatial reactive active sites. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a systematic review of the latest advancements in the photocatalytic H₂O₂ production to further enhance the development of photocatalytic H₂O₂ production. In this review, three photocatalytic H₂O₂ production systems are comprehensively discussed, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) system with and without sacrificial agents, the water oxidation reaction (WOR) system accompanied by hydrogen evolution reaction, and the dual system coupling ORR with WOR. By bridging molecular‐scale mechanistic insights with system‐level innovation, this review not only explains fundamental mechanisms but also bridges lab‐scale breakthroughs to industrial viability, positioning photocatalytic H₂O₂ production as a cornerstone for green chemistry and renewable energy storage, with implications for environmental remediation and carbon‐neutral synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of safety alarm systems and sustainable power generators that can sustain extreme temperature environments and contact with fire can be lifesaving, but challenging at the same time. Here, a biomaterial (chitosan‐phytic acid) coated non‐flammable cotton fabric‐based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is developed that can be used as a self‐powered fire alarm system in extreme situations. A single‐electrode mode‐based flame‐retardant TENG (FR‐TENG) is fabricated using an aluminum electrode, chitosan, and phytic acid‐coated cotton fabric using a layer‐by‐layer (LBL) self‐assembly method as the active material. Structural, morphological, and thermal characterization is performed to confirm the uniform distribution of the active material in the cotton fabric. The treated cotton fabric demonstrates excellent flame retardancy and excellent self‐extinguishing in the soaking and dry LBL method. In addition, the FR‐TENG produces an excellent electrical output voltage, current, and charge of 62 V, 170 nA, and 17 nC. Finally, the FR‐TENG is used as a fire alarm system integrated with a programmed microcontroller unit, where a warning LED lights up when some fire situations occur, followed by a fire alarm on the screen to initiate a rescue operation. This work shows great potential for eco‐friendly self‐powered systems based on non‐flammable materials that can be lifesaving in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Efficient and durable energy storage materials are essential to meet the increasing demand for renewable energy technologies. However, existing materials often encounter trade‐offs among energy density, power density, and cycling stability. To overcome these limitations, a 2D imide‐linked polyoxometalate‐covalent organic framework (i‐POCOF) is introduced. This hybrid material combines the redox activity of polyoxometalates (POMs) with the structural adaptability of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Complementarily, 0D imide‐functionalized POM‐molecule and 1D POM‐polymer systems are investigated, enabling a systematic evaluation of how dimensionality affects their physicochemical properties and electrochemical performance. By increasing dimensionality, the hybrids exhibit improved surface area ranging from 107 m 2 g −1 for 0D to 257 m 2 g −1 for 2D, and optimized porosity (average pore size from 1.9 nm for 0D to 3.7 nm for 2D), resulting in enhanced ion diffusion and charge transport. In particular, 2D i‐POCOF exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance, achieving a specific capacitance of 132 F g −1 , energy density of 73.3 Wh kg −1 , and power density of 0.9 kW kg −1 , with only 6% capacitance loss after 5000 cycles. These findings highlight the potential of POM hybrids as high‐performance and stable energy storage hybrids, providing a promising pathway to overcome current limitations in electrode materials.",

Copper‐doped titanium dioxide/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites are synthesized to enable visible‐light activation, achieving 89% methylene blue removal within 60 min under visible light illumination. The coating's mechanical and chemical stability is systematically evaluated under UV exposure, sonication‐induced vibration, and cyclic regeneration using chemical washing. Scaffold design parameters, including pore architecture, surface topology, and chemistry, are optimized to enhance nanocomposite loading and retention. Among the tested infill designs, the gyroid structure provides the highest surface area (3259.2 mm 2 ) and supports the largest nanocomposite mass. Incorporation of polydopamine as a bioadhesive significantly improves coating adhesion (378% increase in nanocomposite loading) and stability (200% reduction in leaching). Surface engineering also facilitates the formation of uniform, few‐layer coatings, resulting in a removal efficiency of 93% within 120 min, which is comparable to that of colloidal nanocomposites reported in the literature. The nano‐enabled scaffold maintains excellent performance across 30 regeneration and reuse cycles, with a final‐cycle removal efficiency of 91.4%, outperforming existing systems by more than fourfold in terms of reusability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR), when coupled with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), presents a sustainable, safe, and energy‐efficient alternative to the traditional Haber–Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. In this work, the rational design, synthesis, and electrochemical evaluation of two cobalt (II)‐based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating 2‐methylimidazole (2‐MeIm) and benzimidazole (BIm) as organic linkers is reported. Comprehensive voltammetric and in situ spectroelectrochemical studies confirm that Co(2‐MeIm) and Co(BIm) MOFs exhibit excellent electrochemical stability and catalytic activity toward ENRR and OER. Notably, Co(BIm) MOF achieves an impressive ammonia production rate of 260 µg h⁻¹ mg⁻¹ with a Faradaic efficiency of 35.42%, significantly outperforming Co(2‐MeIm) MOF (5.0 µg h⁻¹ mg⁻¹ and 15.0%, respectively). Furthermore, Co(BIm) MOF demonstrates outstanding OER performance, with a low Tafel slope of 50.1 mV dec⁻¹ and an overpotential of just 290 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm⁻ 2 . To the best of the authors knowledge, these ENRR and OER metrics represent among the highest reported for MOF‐based electrocatalysts, highlighting the potential of tailored ligand environments in enhancing dual‐function electrocatalytic performance.",

For this, pure phase NFP is synthesized via an ultrasound‐assisted sol‐gel route, with calcination at 600 °C for 5 h in an N 2 atmosphere. The dielectric studies of NFP revealed very high dielectric constant (ɛ r ′) values (10 2 &lt; ɛ r ′ &lt; 10 3 ), with non‐ideal Debye‐like relaxation with frequency. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant (ɛ r ″) demonstrated that conductivity is a major contributor to the overall dielectric loss in the sample.

    "abstract": "Abstract Carbon black‐loaded activated carbon (CB‐loaded AC) is a cost‐effective catalyst for CH 4 decomposition to produce H 2 . CB induces defects on the AC surface, enhancing catalytic activity. Current studies on the role of defects in promoting CH 4 decomposition are primarily experimental, with unclear mechanisms. Hence, exploring the reaction mechanism of defects in CH 4 decomposition is crucial. In this work, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) are used to construct defects (Mono‐Vacancy defect, Di‐Vacancy defect, and Stone‐Wales defect) on the AC surface, determining the catalytic mechanism of defects in CH 4 decomposition. The results show that during the CH 4 decomposition (C─H bond cleavage) phase, defective AC reduces the energy barriers for CH 4 decomposition. Under identical conditions, the rate‐determining step of C─H bond cleavage in CH 4 occurs more readily on AC with Mono‐Vacancy, Di‐Vacancy, and Stone‐Wales defects, with corresponding reductions in energy barriers of 4.64, 2.36, and 3.12%, respectively. The total energy barriers for the reaction are reduced by 12.95, 27.58, and 8.43%, respectively. This indicates that the defects significantly lower the energy barrier for CH 4 decomposition, thereby facilitating the reaction and confirming that these defects act as active sites for the catalytic decomposition of CH 4 on AC.",

The Al V –rich amorphous silica‐alumina (ASA) catalysts with the strong Brønsted acidic sites (BAS) might be an alternative to the zeolites; however, the existing preparations are costly and complex. A hydrothermal preparation of Al V ‐rich (37.90–43.46%) nonporous ASA catalysts is presented, which is achieved by collecting the synthesis gel of an FAU‐type structure during its induction period. The resultant ASA catalysts demonstrated (very) strong BAS, depending on the Al V /Al IV ratio, and a high density of Lewis acidic sites (LAS), which are stronger than the industrially relevant zeolites. The ASA catalysts examined in the cracking of various polyolefin‐based plastics resulted in excellent polymer degradation activity, increased light olefins production, high‐quality heavy aromatics‐free liquid oils, and up to zilch coking, which are clearly superior to those obtained using a crystalline zeolite. Despite having (very) strong BAS, the exceptional light olefins production and suppressed coke formation by the ASA catalysts are possibly due to the synergy between a high density of LAS and free mass transfer, which favors the monomolecular over the bimolecular cracking mechanism.",

The ink formulation combines micro‐ and nanoparticles, enhancing electrical conductivity—up to 10 times compared to microparticle‐only inks. Micro‐fibrillated cellulose (Exilva) is used as a sustainable binder, aligning with eco‐friendly electronics initiatives. Besides the formulation, the benefit of a multistep chemical sintering approach, based on the sequential immersion of the printed structures in acetic acid solution, is demonstrated. If with a more conventional one‐step acetic acid sintering treatment a conductivity of ≈3.18 × 10⁵ S m − ¹ can be achieved, the use of the multi‐step process further enhances both conductivity, increasing conductivity ≈2.6 times to ≈8.37 × 10⁵ S m − ¹ (sheet resistance 0.06 Ω □ − ¹), it is the highest reported value achieved through chemical sintering—just 20 times lower than bulk Zn (≈16.6 × 10⁶ S m − ¹). Importantly, the ink, following the proposed chemical sintering and without encapsulation also exhibits outstanding air stability, maintaining functionality with only an ≈11% increase in resistance after 6 months in ambient conditions (40–60% RH).

    "abstract": "Abstract Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely explored in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis due to their tunable structures, high surface area, and abundant active sites. During OER process, MOFs transform into metal oxyhydroxides, which serve as actual active species for oxygen evolution. Therefore, the rational design of MOFs to enhance this transformation is crucial for achieving superior OER performance. In this study, nickel‐cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo‐LDH) is used as a 2D template for MOF synthesis, and both 2,6‐naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (NDC) and defect ligand ferrocenecarboxylic acid (Fc) are introduced to convert the hydroxide precursor to a defect‐rich MOF material (NiCo‐NDC‐Fc/NF), which directly applies as an OER electrocatalyst. This strategy enables the construction of coordination defects in MOFs, exposing a large number of unsaturated metal sites that facilitated catalyst reconstruction, leading to outstanding OER activity. The NiCo‐NDC‐Fc/NF catalyst exhibits remarkably low overpotentials of only 219 and 254 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm −2 , respectively. Furthermore, this catalyst also demonstrates excellent stability after operating at 60 mA cm −2 for 100 h. This work offers a facile method for the effective construction of defective MOFs, and provides valuable reference for the design of MOF‐based electrocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The poor electrochemical performance of pristine WS 2 is mainly due to its low conductivity which restricts the redox kinetics. Enhancement in the electrochemical performance of WS 2 as negative electrodes in sodium ion battery (SIB) has been attempted by forming composites with hard carbon (HC) derived from the linear polysaccharide biopolymer chitosan. It is observed that assembling of WS 2 nanostructures on N/O (nitrogen/oxygen) heteroatom loaded hard carbon sheet derived from the biowaste chitosan improves the conductivity, reduces polysulfide leaching, and balances the inherent drawback of volume alteration in the negative electrodes. The electrochemical performance of the WS 2 @HC electrodes is investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. This work establishes that the heteroatom loaded hard carbon support provides mechanical stability and can improve the cycling stability and rate capability of WS 2 by enhancing ion diffusion kinetics.",

The Raman spectroscopy shows the presence of a higher degree of defects in the Cotton‐shell‐derived hard carbon (CC). The Phosphoric acid‐treated cotton shell‐derived hard carbon (PCC) shows a higher I d /I g ratio than the CC implying the generation of more active defect sites, which is supported from BET, FESEM, and TEM analysis. The CV results indicate that the PCC favors better sodium ion diffusion into the carbon matrix than CC electrode. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) shows a low charge transfer resistance of only 25 Ω for PCC electrode which is rather high (110 Ω) in the case of CC electrode. PCC offers capacity 350 mAhg −1 in the initial cycles, and stabilising at ≈300 mAhg −1 after 300 cycles. The CC electrode displays capacities of 310 mAhg −1 with a retention of 91%, while the PCC electrode gives capacities of 350 mAhg −1 with a retention of 96% at 0.03 Ag −1 . The phosphoric acid treatment generates more active defect sites to accommodate sodium ions into the carbon matrix, which facilitates electrochemical performance.",

The key to sustaining or improving agrivoltaic crop yields is PV panel semi‐transparency. This study assesses effects of dynamic shading control and effects of PV semi‐transparency on plant seedling growth. A temperature‐controlled growth chamber with a lamp reproducing the solar irradiance transition of a sunny, summer day enables seedling response evaluation. A PV module with sparsely embedded micro‐solar cells allowing for interstitial transparency, inserted between the lamp and cucumber seedlings, shades light throughout simulated daytime or temporarily around midday (9:30–14:30) when irradiance exceeds 800 W m −2 . Shading from the PV panel mitigates any increase in seedling temperature. The continuous PV shadow elongates spindly seedling hypocotyls. The temporary shading has no adverse effect on the dry matter accumulation of seedlings, whereas continuous shading suppresses it. These results demonstrate the benefits of temporary midday shading to sustain normal crop growth with agrivoltaics. The dynamically operated semi‐transparent PV operation enables more granular and efficient apportionment of electrical energy and crop production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a novel approach to enhancing the elasticity and durability of bio‐asphalt by inducing calcium crosslinking in bio‐oil through the formation of calcium–carboxylate complexes. Experimental results show that the crosslinked binder exhibits up to an 18% increase in elastic recovery, as confirmed by Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) tests. The improved performance is attributed to the formation of a robust internal network between CaCl₂ and fatty acid groups in the bio‐oil, which enhances elasticity and reduces permanent deformation under repeated loading. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal strong coordination between Ca 2 ⁺ ions and carboxylate groups, with stepwise interaction energies of −339.4, −193.2, and −79.3 kcal mol −1 for the first, second, and third oleate ligands, respectively. This coordination limits the mobility of hydrophilic acidic components, reducing their migration to siliceous surfaces—a key mechanism associated with moisture‐induced damage. FTIR and contact angle measurements confirm improved resistance to dewetting and moisture exposure in CaCl₂‐doped bio‐bitumen. Additionally, the crosslinked structure inhibits alkane stacking, which contributes to resistance against low‐temperature cracking. Beyond performance, this method supports sustainability by utilizing a low‐energy curing process and renewable bio‐based materials. The findings demonstrate the potential of calcium‐induced crosslinking to address multiple limitations of bio‐modified binders and provide a viable path toward more resilient and environmentally friendly asphalt pavements.",

Although the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) exhibits broadband solar spectral absorption, its limited visible‐light harvesting and salt resistance ability constrain practical performance. Herein, a 2D FePc‐rGO/PAN photothermal membrane via electrospinning is reported. In which, Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is designed as a fibrous substrate to effectively stabilize the heterostructured porous FePc/rGO, achieving a hierarchical architecture from micron‐sized cross‐linked fiber networks, nanoscale surface porosity, to molecular arrangements. This composite membrane shows a high solar conversion efficiency of 93.45% compared to that of the prepared 1.5%GO‐PAN (74.89%). Under one sun illumination, FePc‐rGO/PAN with the hierarchical structure exhibits a maximum evaporation rate of 5.79 kg m − 2 over 2 h irradiation. The enhanced desalination performance of the rGO/FePc‐PAN is partially attributed to the light absorption enhancement by FePc in the visible spectrum (400–700 nm), the near‐infrared region (1500–2400 nm) and the interactions between FePc and rGO. Additionally, the low surface activity of FePc molecules contributes to the anti‐salt deposition capability of the rGO/FePc‐PAN, while maintaining a stable membrane structure after repeated water washing cycles.",

Notably, as the hard segment content increased, the crystallization properties and physical crosslinking density which are determining factors of the shape‐memory effect showed an opposite trend. Furthermore, the PIUs showed good hydrolysis effects in pH 1, 7.2, and 13 conditions.

Persistent challenges, including substantial thermal dissipation and insufficient CO 2 supply at the interface, severely compromise catalytic performance. Herein, a holistic interface design strategy is proposed for boosting CO 2 reduction by synergistically optimizing catalyst distribution and regulating the reaction microenvironment. The developed interface integrates a porous catalyst matrix promoting light penetration and fluid flow, a heat insulation structure maximizing photothermal utilization, and gas‐permeable microchannels ensuring continuous CO 2 supplementation to active sites while facilitating product desorption.

Comprehensive investigations into the energy and mass transfer mechanism reveal that the increase in catalytic activity stems from synergistic effects, including optimized photon flux transmission, elevated local temperature through thermal confinement, and maintained high CO 2 concentration around the catalyst. These findings collectively validate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed interfacial modulation method, offering novel insights for promoting solar fuel synthesis.",

To address this issue, extensive research has been conducted over the decades to develop highly efficient catalysts for both the hydrogen and anodes to minimize overpotential. In particular, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the cathode has been recognized as a rate limiting process of WE. However, most known high‐efficiency OER catalysts are rare metal‐based materials posing challenges related to resource limitations and high costs. In this study, a Regenerative Redox‐Mediated Electrolysis System (RReMES) is proposed, which enables hydrogen production at a significantly lower overpotential compared to conventional water electrolysis utilizing the OER. The reduction of WE overpotential is achieved by introducing hydroquinone (HQ) into the electrolyte, facilitating the oxidation of hydroquinone instead of the OER. HQ is a redox‐active species with a lower oxidation potential than the OER and is oxidized to benzoquinone (BQ). Since BQ can be photochemically regenerated back to HQ by light, maintaining a low overpotential is feasible through the continuous illumination of light. This paper discusses the system configuration, WE performances, and impact of redox active agents on the performance of RReMES.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Insects are highly diversified organisms that often form strong relationships with microorganisms. This relationship is driven by the secretion and exchange of various proteins. Among these, laccase (Lac), also known as multicopper oxidoreductase, is notable due to its high redox potential, broad substrate specificity, and reactivity. Many insects that produce Lacs are capable of breaking down various plant materials, including leaf litter, wood, paper, wool, clothes, and leather. As such, Lac is of prime importance in insect‐microbe ecological roles and it is important that Lacs are further explored for a range of beneficial applications. Although some studies already highlight the potential of insect‐microbe‐associated Lacs in biotechnology and bioremediation, they are not as extensively identified, characterized, or explored as those from fungi and bacteria. Lacs are typically produced by various organisms and secreted outside of cells via complex pathways. The biosynthesis of Lac can be enhanced or engineered through bioinformatics, genetic engineering, and synthetic biology tools, which achieve significant success in genome mining over the last decade. This review aims to raise awareness of the untapped potential of insect‐microbe‐associated Lacs and calls for their further exploration for human benefit.",

This study investigates Cu/Zn‐MOF‐74 catalysts with varying metal ratios for carbon dioxide (CO₂)‐epoxide cycloaddition. Compared to monometallic Cu‐MOF‐74 and Zn‐MOF‐74, the bimetallic system shows superior catalytic activity for epoxides conversion. Vim─COOH@Cu/Zn‐MOF‐74 is developed by introducing hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and nitrogen‐containing linkers. The optimal Vim─COOH@Cu₀.₆₇Zn₀.₃₃‐MOF‐74 demonstrates outstanding performance in CO₂‐epichlorohydrin cycloaddition, achieving 96.4% conversion and 98.5% selectivity under mild conditions (80 °C, 1.0 MPa, 24 h) without co‐catalysts, while maintaining excellent recyclability. Using a one‐pot synthesis, bimetallic MOFs with controlled Cu/Zn ratios are prepared. The framework is further modified by incorporating 1,4‐butanediyl‐3,3′‐bis‐1‐vinylimidazolium bromide and HBD‐functionalized imidazole bromide monomers. The resulting composites achieve over 80% conversion under solvent‐free, co‐catalyst‐free conditions due to synergistic effects between Lewis acid sites, carboxyl groups, and nucleophilic Br⁻ ions. This work presents an effective strategy for developing efficient MOF catalysts for CO₂ conversion. The Vim─COOH@Cu/Zn‐MOF‐74 system demonstrates significant potential for sustainable CO₂ utilization in cyclic carbonate synthesis, combining high activity, selectivity, and stability under environmentally friendly reaction conditions.",

This focus has recently extended to 2D TM borides, identified in 2017 as potential MXene analogs and now termed MBenes. Over the last five years, MBenes have garnered increasing attention across nanotechnology, physical sciences, and chemistry, owing to their diverse and promising physicochemical properties. These materials exhibit high electrical conductivity, chemical reactivity, and mechanical robustness, suggesting substantial potential in energy storage and electrocatalysis. However, MBene research remains nascent, with many of their theoretically predicted properties yet to be experimentally confirmed. Compared to MXenes, MBenes display heightened structural complexity, including polymorphism and phase transitions, which complicates their synthesis and exfoliation into monolayer nanoflakes (NFs). This review provides a comprehensive overview of MBenes as a distinct class of 2D TM borides derived from MAB phases. Recent progress in their synthesis, characterization, and application is summarized, and ongoing challenges in both experimental fabrication and computational modeling are critically assessed.

The designability, tunability, and robustness are key attributes of MOFs, making them materials of high pursuit. The detection and removal of antibiotics are of prime importance in the area of environmental remediation, where MOFs are increasingly utilized effectively. Antibiotic detection is vastly investigated using fluorescent MOFs, and the fluorescent behavior of MOFs originates from the linker, metal ions, or both. Fluorescent MOFs can be synthesized by systematic design and critical linkers and metal ions selection. In addition, their fluorescence attributes can be fine‐tuned by encapsulating various guest molecules within MOFs. On the other hand, the reduction of antibiotics via physical adsorption and photocatalytic degradation by using MOFs is another promising application to remediate wastewater and eliminate bacterial antibiotic resistance. Compiling state‐of‐the‐art progress and providing rational insights on detecting and removing antibiotics using Zn‐MOFs are of paramount interest in advancing this field. The recent advances of Zn‐based MOFs for detecting and removing antibiotics are emphasized.

In this study, eco‐friendly polylactic acid (PLA)/bleached pulp composites are developed using a simple solution‐casting method to investigate their potential as high‐performance PDRC materials. The composites demonstrate exceptional emissivity in the long‐wavelength infrared range, reaching a maximum of 0.94 at a 70 wt.% cellulose content. This superior performance is attributed to the unique molecular structure of cellulose and hemicellulose in the bleached pulp, which enhances optical scattering and emissive properties across the infrared spectrum. The composites also exhibit high solar reflectance in the visible‐to‐near‐infrared region, which is critical for minimizing solar heating. Outdoor experiments revealed significant cooling effects, with the 70 wt.% bleached pulp composites achieving a surface temperature 11.1 °C below ambient and demonstrating a radiative cooling power of 110.17 W m − 2 . Additionally, in the biodegradation experiments, successful biodegradation is observed, with the sample completely decomposing over 18 d. These results highlight the effectiveness of the PLA/bleached pulp composites under real‐world conditions and their potential for sustainable thermal management applications. Consequently, this study provides a foundation for the further optimization of PDRC materials using simple fabrication techniques, offering a cost‐effective and environmentally friendly solution for passive cooling systems.",

This review examines advancements in MoS 2 ‐based supercapacitors, including strategies to enhance electrical conductivity through doping, hybridization, and composite formation. Structural stability and specific capacitance are improved via nanoscale engineering, interlayer spacing control, and hybrid designs.

The single‐layer Ti 3 C 2 can enhance the adsorption capacity of the photocatalyst for methylene blue (MB), and its excellent conductivity improves the electron‐hole separation rate. In the photocatalytic test, 3% TC/MBV showed better photocatalytic activity, and 95.75% of MB is removed. It went beyond that twice of BV (42%) and better than 3‐MBV (79%), significantly. And the normalized degradation rates ( k norm ) values for 3‐MBV and 3% TC/MBV are 1.19 times and 1.37 times that of BV, respectively. 3% TC/MBV can effectively degrade MB in the wide pH range (5–11), and it is able to resist the disturbance of most common anions. Besides, 3% TC/MBV can still maintain a high degradation level and good stability after five cycles.

One promising solution is the direct patterning of laser‐induced graphene (LIG) conductive tracks onto bioderived substrates. In this study, several wood panels are successfully fabricated with different resin formulations from Jatropha curcas L. seeds to reduce the urea‐formaldehyde content, and the feasibility of LIG‐based electronics on these panels is assessed. The panels’ physical and mechanical properties are evaluated, including thickness swelling and internal bond strength, and conductive LIG is successfully scribed on all samples. Proofs of concept include a four‐LED circuit and humidity sensors, with the best sensor achieving ≈0.2031 pF %RH −1 sensitivity and ≈5% hysteresis error.

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing accumulation of plastic waste presents serious environmental and health concerns, necessitating efficient recycling technologies to support a circular economy. Here, a cost‐effective and efficient catalyst is reported for depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and various polyesters into their respective monomers. This closed‐loop recycling strategy is inspired by solvolysis and enabled by a bifunctional acid–base ZnO–SiO 2 catalyst. An in situ growth method enhances metal–support interactions at the Zn─O─Si interface, leading to the formation of Zn─O─Si species and well‐dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters (≈3.5 nm), which generate abundant acid–base active sites. The optimized catalyst achieved a 94% yield of bis(2‐hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) from PET glycolysis at 180 °C in 1.5 h under co‐solvent‐free conditions. It further exhibits high catalytic efficiency in the methanolysis of PET and other polyesters (polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polybutylene succinate (PBS), and polylactic acid (PLA)), with monomer yields above 90%. A scale‐up experiment with 10 g PET delivers ≈90% BHET yield, confirming the catalyst's practical applicability. Green chemistry metrics are used to validate the efficiency and sustainability of the process. The high monomer productivity (40–50 g monomer ·g catalyst −1 ·h −1 ) and reduced environmental footprint highlight the promise of this system for sustainable plastic upcycling.",

A variable number of stacked high‐temperature‐superconducting (HTS) tapes is used to elucidate an optimal trapped field on a minimum number of stacked tapes. At liquid nitrogen temperature, the surface remnant magnetic flux varies from 0.12 T for 5 tapes to 0.27 T for 121 tapes. Then a 1 m long vacuum cryostat with a stack of 29 tapes is designed and constructed. The cryostat is cooled down with a PM magnetizer of 0.80 T. On the cryostat, trapped fields of 90 mT at 77 K and 156 mT at 40 K are obtained, respectively. Although the remnant field in the tapes is low, the suitability for levitation and transport of a PM vehicle is demonstrated. The experimental study for the first time provides the special conditions and properties for suspending and floating a PM above an HTS tape stack as an important step toward the proposed multifunctional superhighway system.",

However, conventional water evaporation‐driven energy harvesting technologies rely on intricate nanostructures, which suffer from complex fabrication processes, high costs, and scalability challenges. This paper develops a novel Bamboo‐based Evaporation‐Induced Generator (BbEIG) using discarded disposable bamboo chopsticks. The inherent porous structure of bamboo enables efficient thermal energy harvesting from the environment through water evaporation and its subsequent conversion into electricity. At room temperature, the BbEIG achieves an open‐circuit voltage of 0.36 V and a short‐circuit current of 10 µA, demonstrating stable power output for 12 000 s. The power density of BbEIG is 2 µW cm −2 , which is currently a record. The device can charge a 10 000 µF capacitor to its saturation voltage within 40 min. By connecting 18 BbEIG units in series, an open‐circuit voltage of 7 V is achieved, sufficient to illuminate a light‐emitting diode (LED). Furthermore, the integrated system successfully powers a commercial temperature‐humidity sensor, enabling continuous operation. The results of this work show that the combination of disposable bamboo chopsticks and evaporation‐induced power generation provides a sustainable green energy supply strategy for distributed sensing networks.",

The novelty of this work lies in the systematic investigation of thermal pretreatment (torrefaction) and its influence on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of biomass‐derived CDs. Torrefaction enhances PL intensity in CDs synthesized from almond peels and butternut seeds, while having a limited effect on those from butternut peels. The resulting CDs exhibit excitation‐dependent, blue‐emitting fluorescence and maintain over 85% PL stability across the environmentally relevant pH range of 5–9. To enable pollutant detection, the optimized CDs are embedded into chitosan‐based hydrogels, forming water‐stable, reusable fluorescent sensors. These composites detect aromatic contaminants, including pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 4‐chloro‐2‐methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), with detection limits of 1.45 ± 0.08 and 4.10 ± 0.10 n m , respectively. The combination of waste valorization, surface‐state modulation, and soft‐material integration supports the development of cost‐effective, environmentally friendly sensors.

    "abstract": "Abstract The disposal of cigarette product waste has become an urgent environmental issue. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) bring the possibility of resource utilization of discarded cigarette packages due to their ability to use various materials for sensing and energy harvesting. However, the TENGs based on waste materials reported have problems such as low utilization rate of waste and high manufacturing costs. To address these issues, a fully discarded cigarette pack‐based flexible triboelectric sensor is proposed. The material is entirely sourced from the main waste of cigarette packs and the preparation process is simple, making it both environmentally friendly and economically advantageous. The sensor exhibits a wide detection range and good sensitivity to the change of force. In addition, it performs well in applications such as human motion monitoring, sitting posture recognition, and human‐computer interaction. Specifically, it can effectively perceive joint movements and changes in plantar pressure resulting from various actions; combined with a linear support vector machine, it achieves accurate recognition of four common sitting postures with an accuracy of 99.5%; and it has been integrated into a wearable remote control system, enabling remote interaction with rescue vehicles.

    "abstract": "Abstract Amidst the rapid development of AIoT, powering sensor nodes has become a major challenge for IoT. Moreover, research on self‐powered systems for complex scenarios like cargo ships is limited. This study proposes a cargo ship monitoring system based on ball‐joint tandem array triboelectric nanogenerators (BJTA‐TENGs), whose modular design is arranged in a similar way to the body segments of caterpillars. The BJTA‐TENGs consist of five TENGs connected in series using ball joints, featuring multi‐channel cross‐sensing capabilities. They can convert the vibrational energy generated as the ship plows through waves into electrical energy, while simultaneously outputting electrical signals that reflect the ship's navigation status. Upon testing, a single TENG generates an effective output power of 0.0057 µW (power density 23.351 µW m − 3 ) and remains stable after 20,000 cycles. Furthermore, based on the 5‐channel BJTA‐TENGs and the GRU algorithm model, the monitoring system achieves recognition accuracies of 2 mm for vibration amplitude, 0.2 Hz for vibration frequency, 1° for tilt angle, and 0.1 Hz for tilt frequency, with an average accuracy rate of 98.76%. The trained model is deployed on a computer, with OpenBCI used for Wi‐Fi wireless signal transmission. The final recognition results can be visualized on a computer.",

Compared to pristine NiCr‐LDH, hydrothermally synthesized and thoroughly characterized (structural, morphological, textural and compositional properties) batch of NiSe 2 /NiCr‐LDH reveals significant improvement in the electrocatalytic activity toward urea oxidation reaction (UOR, E 10 = 1.351 V and Tafel slope = 31 mV dec −1 ), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, E 10 = 0.117 V, Tafel slope = 72 mV dec −1 ). The improved UOR and HER activities are attributed to selenization and Cr‐doping in Ni‐based LDH structure. It is corroborated by higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), electrical conductivity and mass transport, favorable adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates, and enhanced wettability of the catalyst. The real‐time application of NiSe 2 /NiCr‐LDH as a bifunctional UOR and HER catalyst is demonstrated by achieving a cell potential corresponding to E 10 = 1.42 V for the alkaline water‐urea electrolysis. The overall energy consumption for hydrogen generation via water‐urea electrolysis is decreased by ≈16% as compared to that of water electrolysis, with 95% faradaic efficiency.

An external magnetic field‐induced facile method for macroscopic alignment critically improves porosity and tortuosity. The effects of these differences on the capacity vary depending on the current density. Porosity is influential over a wide range of current densities, whereas tortuosity becomes significant near a rate of 1 C. The magnetic alignment along the out‐of‐plane direction leads to higher porosity and lower tortuosity, noticeably improving the capacity by 90% compared to that of the in‐plane‐aligned anode at 1 C.",

Previously, a bicyclic guanidine superbase has been identified as an efficient and thermally stable n‐type dopant, whose crosslinked version with two superbases joined by a decenylene chain enhances their thermal and humidity stability. In this study, first, a non‐crosslinked superbase with a decyl group is synthesized and used to dope CNTs. The structural effects on doping stability are evaluated. Stability under heat and humidity reveals that crosslinking is crucial to maintaining n‐type behavior. The planar molecular shape of the superbase moiety and hydrophobic alkyl chains contribute, respectively, to the thermal and humidity stability of n‐doped CNTs. Second, a crosslinked superbase cation is incorporated into an electrolyte for electrochemical doping. The superbase cation stabilizes the doped CNTs, which retain n‐type properties even under aging (1000 h at 100 °C in air). This approach allows precise control over electron and hole densities, increases TE power factors (230 and 108 mW m −1 K −2 for p‐ and n‐type, respectively), and stabilizes doped states through coordination with cationic and anionic species, demonstrating the importance of molecular design in achieving stable, high‐performance n‐type CNTs.",

To the best of the knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the simultaneous photoelectrocatalysistic (PEC) of RhB degradation and hydrogen evolution using a single photoanode under visible light in both alkaline electrolyte and natural seawater. The enhanced performance of the composite photoanode is attributed to improved charge separation efficiency via the creation of an internal electric field as supported by Mott–Schottky, transient photocurrent, and EIS studies. The proposed PEC mechanism reveals that direct hole oxidation played a decisive role in the degradation of RhB and that the presence of RhB can boost the H 2 production. In natural seawater, the PEC degradation of RhB is markedly improved, attributed to the high conductivity of seawater. Although the hydrogen evolution is significantly suppressed in seawater due mainly to the deposition of Mg(OH) 2 and Ca(OH) 2 at Pt cathode, the findings are the first to show the potential application of p‐CuBi 2 O 4 /n‐Bi 2 MoO 6 photoanode for PEC water purification and simultaneous renewable energy production in natural seawater.

These composites are manufactured via infiltration of bio‐based polymers into porous bleached wood (BW), offering a sustainable alternative to glass and plastic in applications such as energy‐efficient windows and smartphone displays. In this study, the highest level of transparency in transparent wood (TW) substrates is achieved using biobased resins and an environmentally friendly bleaching process. Pristine balsa wood is bleached using non‐toxic chemicals and subsequently infiltrated with two bio‐based commercial resins, both sustainable and biocompatible. The performance of these bio‐based composites is compared to conventional epoxy resin. Resin viscosity is shown to influence the physical, optical, thermal, and mechanical characteristics of the final composite due to its ability to penetrate and interact with the wood's porous structure. Notably, the plant‐based soya resin‐infiltrated TW achieves exceptional properties, as 91% transparency at 550 nm, alongside remarkable UV stability and hydrophobicity. Additionally, this bio‐based composite shows a ≈50% reduction in thermal conductivity compared to standard glass (≈1 W m·K −1 ), highlighting its potential as a thermally insulative, energy‐efficient material for building‐integrated applications.",

Herein, variable concentrations (1 and 3 wt.%) of fluorine (F) with a fixed amount (3%) of bromine (Br) are effectively synthesized in doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) nanosheets by a facile hydrothermal strategy. This research aimed to efficiently degrade Rhodamine B (RhB) dye together with significant OER kinetics. Optical properties, structural morphology, functional group analysis, elemental composition, and crystallinity of synthesized catalysts are investigated by employing cutting‐edge techniques. Among all samples, the optimized sample (3% F/Br‐MoS 2 ) exhibited maximum RhB reduction efficacy in a basic medium. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel plot, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are conducted to evaluate the electrochemical OER performance of synthesized electrocatalysts. The optimized sample exhibited minimal overpotential, Tafel slope, and charge transfer resistance, indicating the highest OER activity. First‐principles calculations of OH − adsorption energies on pristine and F/Br‐doped MoS 2 monolayers suggest that F/Br doping may enhance OER activity.

    "abstract": "Abstract Lithium‐ion batteries (LiBs) are pivotal for applications in electric vehicles, portable electronics, and energy storage systems, owing to their high energy density and long cycle life. Nevertheless, the intrinsically low electronic conductivity of Ni‐rich cathodes (e.g., NCM811) severely restricts charge transfer kinetics, thereby constraining battery performance. To address this critical issue, a composite conductive additive comprising functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon black (CB) is designed to construct a 3D conductive network and facilitate lithium‐ion transport. Furthermore, the regulatory effects of CNTs' functionalized groups (─COOH, ─OH, ─NH 2 ) on cathode‐electrolyte interface (CEI) formation kinetics, cathode structural stability, and long‐term cycling performance are elucidated. The results reveal that the steric hindrance and polarity of functional groups significantly influence both the construction of the conductive network and the formation and stability of the CEI layer. Among them, the optimized CB/CNT‐COOH electrode exhibits superior rate capability (53.1% capacity retention at 10C relative to 0.1C) and cycling stability (73.8% retention after 200 cycles at 1C), surpassing pristine CB and other functionalized CNTs. This work clarifies the mechanism of functional groups optimizing charge transport and interfacial stability, providing a scalable strategy to advance high‐energy Ni‐rich cathodes.",

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during electrochemical water splitting is anticipated to produce green hydrogen commercially. Alternative electrocatalysts to the Pt based materials have shown low performance in terms of high overpotential or low cycle life. To meet the high demand for minimal usage of noble metals toward HER, bimetallic and/or core‐shell nanostructures are being evaluated. The present report demonstrates a facile preparation of Cu@Pd core‐shell nanostructures over a copper foil toward HER, involving a template electrodeposition of copper followed by palladium deposition through galvanic replacement reaction. The results show highly promising catalytic stability toward HER in acidic medium with an overpotential value of 185 mV for reaching a current density of –10 mA.cm −2 , together with a Tafel slope of 120 mV.dec −1 , which suggests a facile HER kinetics over Cu@Pd/Cu foil and a promising long‐term stability for 16 h suggesting their potentiality toward commercial HER applications. The catalysts are further extended toward HER in neutral and seawater electrolytes to evaluate the versatility of Cu@Pd/Cu foil. The HER activities are supported by in situ Raman analysis to get interfacial information during the reaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Marine distributed sensing networks remain constrained by the short lifespan, maintenance complexity, and ecological risks of battery‐based power systems. Conventional energy harvesters typically rely on single energy sources and generate alternating current, resulting in rectification losses and limited efficiency in dynamic marine environments. To overcome these challenges, a dual‐effect direct‐current oceanic energy collector (DE‐DOEC) is proposed that integrates two novel components: a ternary dielectric triboelectric nanogenerator (TDC‐TENG) and a solar‐filled micro‐thermoelectric generator (SS‐MTEG). The TDC‐TENG adopts a non‐equidistant sector grating and leverages the ternary dielectric effect (ETFE‐Cu‐TPU) to produce rectifier‐free direct current. A quantitative charge‐transfer model is developed to clarify the DC output mechanism. In parallel, the SS‐MTEG employs a polyurethane‐filled heat conduction channel to enhance temperature gradient utilization under solar irradiation. Experimental results confirm that the TDC‐TENG delivers 34.6 mW at 180 rpm, while the SS‐MTEG achieves 60.5 µW under an 80 K temperature difference. Together, they power LEDs, sensors, and wireless modules, demonstrating stable and sustainable performance. This dual‐source strategy enables low‐cost, corrosion‐resistant, and maintenance‐free energy harvesting for marine environments, paving the way toward long‐term deployment of autonomous sensor networks and advancing the development of intelligent ocean infrastructure.",

Efficiency of current electrochemical energy reactions such as, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is primarily limited by the sluggish kinetics of OER/ORR. Pt‐group precious metal scarcity and restrictive cost of the benchmark catalysts restrict the mass adoption of electrochemical energy systems. A novel approach of dual doping of precious metal‐free and high valent metal and non‐metal cations in the A‐site and B‐site of the perovskite, SrCoO 3‐δ (SC) is used to enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance and stability of SC. Due to the high valency and acidity of Bi 3+ and P 5+ ions, Bi 0.05 Sr 0.95 Co 0.95 P 0.05 O 3‐δ (BSCP) exhibits enhanced conductivity, accessible active sites, activity, and stability in OER/ORR. The high‐valent dopants facilitate the steric stabilization of the highly symmetric cubic phase of SC in BSCP, promoting OER/ORR performance. The high Co 3+ /Co 4+ ratio with enhanced electron occupancy of the anti‐bonding eg orbital in the perovskite, a key descriptor for OER/ORR catalytic activity, and enriched oxygen vacancies in BSCP are due to Bi 3+ /P 5+ dual doping, promoting OER/ORR performance with a low bifunctional index (ΔE) of 0.79 V.",

With visible light irradiation, the composite demonstrated H 2 production efficiency of 9352.63 µmol g −1 h −1 , surpassing the efficiencies of ZnIn 2 S 4 ‐Vs and NiCoB counterparts by 6 times and 7 times, respectively. This remarkable rising in photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency arises from three pivotal contributors: 1) The composite material exhibited a 3D flower‐like microsphere morphology, which remarkably boosted the density of active sites; 2) Light reflection and scattering effects induced by the self‐assembled 2D nanosheets constituting the nanoflower architecture effectively enhance the harvesting capability of the composite materials; 3) Schottky heterojunction formed at the interface between NiCoB and ZnIn 2 S 4 ‐Vs facilitates charge carrier separation, thereby elevating photocatalytic activity.

Photosynthetic carbon fixation by plants presents a promising, sustainable approach. While elevated CO 2 (eCO 2 ) is known to modulate plant traits, the dynamics of carbon conversion under such conditions remain insufficiently understood. The interactive effects of eCO 2 , nutrient availability, and temperature are investigated on plant growth and carbon sequestration capacity. The results show that eCO 2 enhances relative growth rate (RGR) and carbon conversion efficiency, with an optimal response observed at 2000 ppm CO 2 . Beyond this threshold, at 3000 ppm, photosynthetic gains declined, indicating inhibitory effects of CO 2 oversaturation. Nutrient enrichment under optimal eCO 2 conditions further stimulated biomass production, particularly in shoot tissues, yet do not significantly alter carbon conversion rates, suggesting a plateau in photosynthetic capacity. Elevated temperatures similarly promoted growth and fixation rates up to a thermal optimum, beyond which photosynthetic efficiency declined. These findings demonstrate the potential and limitations of plant‐based bio‐fixation under future climate scenarios, highlighting its viability as a natural CDR pathway within defined environmental bounds.",

This review assesses the current battery sorting technologies, from manual and mechanical methods to advanced artificial intelligence (AI) driven solutions, along with regulatory challenges and emerging trends.

Two iPOPs, iPOP‐1 and iPOP‐2, are synthesized via a facile Radziszewski multicomponent reaction and designed with multiple interaction sites for the electrostatically driven adsorption of toxic oxoanion, chromate (CrO 4 2− ). The strategic incorporation of methylene spacers in iPOP‐1 resulted in a structurally flexible framework, enabling ultrafast capture kinetics with 99% removal of CrO 4 2− from a 40 ppm aqueous solution within just 15 sec. In contrast, the structurally rigid iPOP‐2, lacking methylene spacer units, exhibits significantly reduced performance, achieving only 25% removal even after 300 seconds of contact time. Notably, iPOP‐1 maintained remarkable selectivity, effectively capturing CrO 4 2− even in the presence of a 200‐fold excess of competing anions (Cl − , Br − , NO 3 − , SO 4 2− , CO 3 2− , H 2 PO 4 − ). To evaluate the practical application potential of iPOP‐1, continuous‐flow CrO 4 2− sequestration experiments are conducted using both glass‐column chromatography and packed‐bed reactor configurations, successfully reducing CrO 4 2− concentrations to below 40 ppb, well within World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water safety thresholds. Additionally, iPOP‐1 demonstrate excellent recyclability, maintaining high sequestration efficiency through five regeneration cycles.

Cu doping, particularly at x = 0.20, stabilizes the β ‐NaMnO 2 phase, suppresses Jahn–Teller distortions, and improves the structural stability of the MnO 2 framework. In situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Cu improved Na + diffusion kinetics and reduces charge‐transfer resistance, despite its electrochemical inactivity. X‐ray Difraction (XRD), Raman, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses reveal phase destabilization and segregation at higher Cu concentrations, while XPS indicates shifts in the Mn/Cu oxidation states, consistent with improved electronic conductivity and multivalent redox behavior. The scanning electron microscope (SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images demonstrate Cu‐induced morphological transitions toward denser, more crystalline structures. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements reveal that the L. nobilis ‐derived hard carbon (HC) anode possesses a high surface area and hierarchical porosity, which facilitated efficient Na + storage and rapid ion transport. Full‐cell tests demonstrate high reversible capacity (≈126 mAh g −1 ), excellent rate capability, and 56% capacity retention over 250 cycles.

Their diminutive size, extensive surface area, and chemically varied composition—frequently augmented with additions, residual monomers, and adsorbed contaminants—improve bioavailability, cellular absorption, and trophic transfer, thereby heightening ecological concerns. This review synthesizes existing research about the origins, environmental alterations, and toxicological mechanisms of NMPs in freshwater ecosystems, emphasizing their interactions with co‐contaminants including heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and persistent organic pollutants. These combinations often exacerbate toxicity via vector effects and synergistic processes.

The limitations of current ecotoxicological assessment tools are critically explored, originally designed for dissolved pollutants, and examine recent developments in detection methodologies, experimental models, and environmental monitoring strategies. The study delineates critical goals for mechanistic investigations that connect molecular‐level responses with ecosystem‐scale effects, as well as the advancement of enhanced diagnostic tools and regulatory frameworks.

In this work, we synthesize a new nickel foam (NF)‐supported Ni x Co x P/Ni 3 S 2 @NF heterojunction by a two‐step hydrothermal process and low‐temperature phosphorization, requiring a straightforward technique. By creatively adjusting the Co ratio to optimize its active surface area, we modify the morphology of Ni x Co x P/Ni 3 S 2 @NF. In accordance with most of the non‐precious metal HER electrocatalysts, the leading to a “ball‐like surface with rough edges and a porous structure.” Ni 2.3 CoP/Ni 3 S 2 @NF nanostructure shows a lower overpotential of 23.1 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec −1 , and high activity with long‐term stability of 24‐hours at constant current density in an alkaline medium of 1.0 M KOH. Also, density‐functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that Ni x Co x P/Ni 3 S 2 @NF heterojunction exhibits no bandgap, indicating high electron mobility, which is typically associated with enhanced catalytic activity.

However, the wide commercialization of platinum‐based electrocatalysts faces significant challenges, including high material costs, insufficient catalytic activity, limited operational durability, and susceptibility to CO poisoning. To overcome these issues, a new Au‐doped Pt‐Co aerogel (AG) is fabricated by the facile one‐pot aqueous‐solution heteroatom doping method. This catalyst demonstrates good electrocatalytic performance for MOR, combining both high activity and remarkable stability. The Au 1 ‐Pt 67 Co 33 AG with optimized Au doping amount exhibits outstanding mass activity, which is 1.7 times that of its undoped Pt 67 Co 33 AG counterpart and 4.6 times that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the Au 1 ‐Pt 67 Co 33 AG demonstrates significantly enhanced long‐term stability under continuous operation. Density functional theory calculations indicate that Au doping reduces the energy barriers for methanol dehydrogenation and lowers the total energy barriers for the *CO oxidation steps, facilitating the rapid dehydrogenation of CH n OH and faster conversion of *CO, thereby significantly enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the Au 1 ‐Pt 67 Co 33 AG toward MOR.",

Agro‐industrial waste valorization, particularly of lignin, offers promising solutions within a circular economy framework. Typically burned to sustain the bioethanol or pulp production process, technical lignins possess polyphenolic structures that make them potential biostimulants with antioxidant and growth‐promoting features. This study explores the synthesis of lignin‐based zinc oxide (ZnO) hybrid materials, combining the bioactive potential of lignin with the essential role of zinc as a plant micronutrient. Utilizing a Kraft lignin (HMW) as a capping agent, the synthesis of a hybrid material is optimized following an ecofriendly protocol. Comprehensive characterization by means of several analytical techniques confirmed the structural integrity of the lignin matrix and the morphology of the ZnO nanoparticles. In vivo experiments on tomato plants demonstrated enhanced dry shoot weight and zinc translocation to aerial parts of the plants, highlighting the controlled nutrient delivery capacity of the hybrid compared to ZnO alone. These findings underscore the potential of lignin@ZnO materials as innovative biostimulants, contributing to sustainable agriculture by repurposing lignin as a valuable agronomic resource.",

Among emerging strategies, photocatalytic degradation using semiconductors is a promising approach to MP remediation. Yet, conventional systems employing photocatalystict slurries suffer from poor recoverability, limited reusability, and scalability issues. Herein, a 3D‐printed silicon carbide (3D‐SiC) photocatalytic platform with tailored architectures and interconnected porous networks is presented for the simultaneous capture and degradation of MPs in both static and continuous flow conditions. The interconnected porous design enhances light absorption and interaction with the MPs, while the robust SiC framework ensures reusability and mechanical integrity. Using polystyrene (PS) microparticles as a model system, the 3D‐SiC demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic performance, achieving 85% MPs removal in just 8 h, and a 4.2‐fold increase in the carbonyl index (CI) after 60 h of simulated sunlight irradiation. Remarkably, the 3D‐SiC retained high photocatalytic activity under dynamic flow conditions, a critical criterion for potential application in water treatment systems. Its mechanical durability, structural adaptability, and consistent reusability over multiple operational cycles further reinforce its suitability for real‐world deployment. This work introduces a customizable and reusable photocatalytic platform, representing a significant step toward the practical application of 3D‐printed functional materials in MPs remediation.",

Despite these advances, several challenges remain unresolved, such as the stability of complex morphologies, large‐scale synthesis, and operational reliability under practical conditions.

Their efficient charge carrier mobility, superior optoelectronic properties derived from optimal bandgap and tunable composition are beneficial for the applications of halide perovskites in the sustainable energy conversion and storage field. This review highlights the inherent potential of halide perovskites as electrocatalysts for oxygen and hydrogen electrocatalysis. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the bottlenecks for sustainable water splitting reactions, for fuel cells, metal‐air batteries, etc., which require electrocatalysts that offer good activity and excellent stability. Though noble metal catalysts offer thriving performance, their cost and stability‐related issues hinder their widespread usage. Non‐noble metal‐based perovskite oxide has already established its stronghold in electrocatalysis. Similarly, their halogen counterpart, perovskite halides, also prove to be efficient contenders for noble metal‐free electrocatalysts. In this review, various suitable synthesis techniques, mechanisms, and the electrocatalytic activity of halide perovskites are discussed. This review aims to show yet another class of compounds (halide perovskites) to the researcher community that strives for the development of noble metal‐free electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.",

However, despite the broad interest in MOFs, their translation from lab scale to industrial scale production is stymied due to expensive and toxic solvents such as N,N‐dimethylformamide (DMF). Thus, transitioning to green chemistry methods for MOF synthesis using inexpensive and benign solvents is imperative to translate MOFs for real‐world applications. Unfortunately, in the vast majority of cases, the use of such benign solvents leads to MOFs with significantly inferior properties, including crystallinity and surface area. Here, a water‐based method is employed to produce UiO‐66(Zr) MOFs with high crystallinity and surface area. This method is enabled by varying NaOH concentration to control both the deprotonation of terephthalic acid and pH, facilitating efficient cluster–ligand coordination at 65 °C and atmospheric pressure. An industrially recyclable solvent such as ethanol is used in the purification process, enhancing scalability and sustainability. In contrast to prior reports, this method yielded highly crystalline MOF particles with a high surface area of 741 m 2 g −1 , demonstrating the effectiveness of aqueous synthesis and green purification for producing high‐quality UiO‐66 materials.",

As a result, Ti/ZnCr‐LDHs display the best performance, achieving complete PET conversion and maximum EG and TPA production of 1215 and 3200 mg gcat −1 h −1 , respectively. This work not only provides a universal way for doping engineering over photocatalysts but also provides insight into upcycling plastic waste.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Zein, a prolamin protein derived from corn, has emerged as a multifunctional and scalable nanocarrier for addressing critical sustainability challenges in agriculture and packaging. This review critically synthesizes and evaluates recent advances in zein‐based nanocarriers for targeted delivery of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, micronutrients, and in smart packaging systems. Drawing from biomedical nanomedicine, it highlights innovations in stimuli‐responsive release of bioactives, hybridization of zein with natural polymers, and plant translocation. Zein, with a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status, biodegradability, and ability to form stable nanoparticles, positions it as a low‐toxicity alternative to conventional synthetic agrochemical carriers and petroleum‐based plastics. Applications in postharvest preservation, humidity‐triggered release, and biosensor‐enabled packaging further elucidates its multifunctionality. Despite strong lab‐scale performance, major challenges remain in field‐scale agrochemical delivery, gaps in its environmental fate, and regulatory approval. This critical review outlines strategies for overcoming these barriers. Overall, zein nanotechnology, framed within the broader goals of climate‐resilient, resource‐efficient, and circular agriculture, offers a roadmap for leveraging zein nanotechnology to reduce environmental burden while improving agricultural productivity. In addition, the challenges that this review paper addresses strongly promote several United Nations Sustainability Development Goals, including UN SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (Climate action), and SDG 15 (life on land).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing demand for energy and the urgency of mitigating environmental degradation and achieving carbon neutrality have created a critical need for renewable energy solutions. Photocatalysis offers a promising route to convert abundant solar energy into clean fuels, but conventional semiconductor photocatalysts only absorb UV light and partial visible light. One strategy to overcome this spectral limitation is to integrate upconversion materials that convert low‐energy near‐infrared photons into higher‐energy visible or UV photons, effectively broadening the light absorption range of photocatalytic systems. This review systematically compares diverse photon upconversion approaches, both lanthanide‐based (rare‐earth phosphors) and emerging non‐lanthanide mechanisms such as defect‐mediated sequential excitations, two‐photon absorption, and organic triplet‐triplet annihilation upconversion, and examines their integration with semiconductor photocatalysts. Structural design strategies (e.g., core‐shell nanostructures) and defect engineering are analyzed to illustrate how they improve light harvesting and charge separation. How these upconversion‐enhanced composites significantly boost solar‐driven reactions is discussed didcussed, notably water splitting for hydrogen production, CO 2 reduction, and pollutant degradation. Finally, key challenges and future directions are highlighted, including enhancing upconversion quantum efficiency, developing rare‐earth‐free upconversion systems, and optimizing interface engineering to maximize energy transfer and overall photocatalytic performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conventional approaches to diagnosing diabetic nephropathy (DN) typically involve blood tests, imaging or biopsy. However, these methods are invasive and require large, specialized equipment, making them unsuitable for frequent monitoring. As precision medicine advances, there is an increasing demand for diagnostic tools that are simple and accessible. Here, a novel sensing system is introduced to simultaneously detect three key DN biomarkers in sweat: glucose (Glu), uric acid (UA), and K + . The system employs a binary composite electrode with high conductivity, large surface area, and abundant active sites, ensuring excellent electrochemical performance and sensitivity for trace detection.To ensure specificity, glucose oxidase (GOx), urate oxidase (UAOx), and K + ‐selective carriers are incorporated. Glu and UA are detected through GOx‐ and UAOx‐catalyzed amperometric reactions, whereas K + levels are determined through open‐circuit potential based on selective ion recognition. To enhance enzyme stability, GOx and UAOx are encapsulated within the microporous covalent organic framework. This universal enzyme protection strategy improves enzyme stability and bioactivity by limiting molecular mobility and shielding the enzymes from environmental stress. The system is successfully applied to analyze sweat samples collected from volunteers, demonstrating its strong potential for routine non‐invasive monitoring of renal health in individuals with diabetes.",

This work reports the preparation of a series of N‐doped porous carbons containing ultrafine dispersions of bismuth using a facile metal‐organic framework‐assisted strategy. The Bi/NC catalyst with optimal bismuth loading (24.8 wt.%) demonstrates appreciable catalytic activity toward electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) by the effective conversion of CO 2 to formate with a more positive onset potential of −0.6 V (vs RHE) and high electrochemically active surface area. As a result, the catalyst possesses formate faradaic efficiency of 91% at −0.8 V (vs RHE) with a long‐term stability of 24 h in 0.5 m KHCO 3 solution. The remarkable catalytic activity of the catalyst is ascribed to the combined effect of enhanced metallic active sites and the enhanced mass transport facilitated via micro‐meso porous carbon matrix containing dominant pyridinic N sites. Notably, DFT calculations reveal that pyridinic N‐ doping in a carbon matrix containing bismuth nanoparticles lowers the energy barrier of * OCHO formation and suppresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.",

In the present work, the heterostructures of manganese oxide/copper oxide (MnO 2 /CuO) are synthesized on copper wires via a facile two‐step method: alkali‐assisted copper surface oxidation, followed by spontaneous redox deposition of manganese dioxide using potassium permanganate under controlled reaction durations. X‐ray diffraction patterns confirmed the presence of Cu, CuO, and copper hydroxide (Cu(OH) 2 ) phases, while Raman spectra revealed the vibrational signatures corresponding to CuO/Cu(OH) 2 and MnO 2 . Tuning the immersion time yields nanorod, needle, and nanosheet architectures; the 40 min sample (MnCu‐40) exhibited the highest specific capacitance among all variants. Spectroscopic analysis revealed an increased Cu charge state (2 + ) and a reduced Mn charge state in the MnCu‐40, suggesting interfacial charge transfer. Spectro‐microscopic analysis indicated strong electronic coupling and mixed valence states at the Mn‐Cu interface. Under operating conditions, MnO 6 in MnO 2 is electrochemically transformed to MnOOH. These findings demonstrate that rationally engineered MnO 2 /CuO heterostructures on 3D Cu scaffolds offer promising pathways for high‐performance supercapacitor electrodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Energy storage devices, like redox‐flow batteries and redox‐supercapacitors, generate electrochemical potential by charging redox‐active molecules. A key component in this class of devices is an ion‐selective membrane that prevents redox‐molecule crossover between half‐cells, while allowing small ions to pass with minimal resistance. Conventional membranes often use ‘forever chemicals’ like Per‐fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), impacting their environmental footprint. This work introduces novel manufacturing methods for membranes made from coatings of cellulose nanofibril on kraft paper for use in these devices. The coating process is optimized to block redox‐active molecules (e.g., alizarin red s and lignosulfonate) and enhance wet ionic conductivity. By refining the cellulose coating with chemical crosslinkers, leakage of redox molecules is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to uncoated kraft paper, without affecting conductivity. The goal is to pave the way for more environmentally friendly membranes in energy storage electrochemical cells. This innovation not only addresses environmental concerns but also the scalability of manufacturing, while maintaining the efficiency and functionality required for the envisioned applications.",

Herein, a newly designed 2D V‐doped Mo 2 CT z (solid‐solution MXene) nanoarchitectonics with a tunable V content are prepared via a two‐step molten salt process. V sites occupy the initial sites of Mo, triggering charge transfer and thereby activating the basal plane.

The battery operates in a hybrid electrolyte of 0.1 m NaCl with 1 m m Zn 2 ⁺, effectively suppressing zinc dendrite formationa major limitation in conventional AZIBs with high Zn 2 ⁺ concentrations. Remarkably, this low‐concentration electrolyte allows stable performance with high overpotential to hydrogen evolution reaction. In situ EQCM and SECM are used to probe ion intercalation and reaction dynamics. The system delivers a high specific capacity of 170.8 mAh g −1 and a power density of 1.75 kW kg −1 at 0.5 A g −1 , with excellent cycling stability—retaining 80% of its capacity over 5000 cycles. This work demonstrates a viable pathway toward a high‐voltage, sustainable aqueous sodium and zinc ion hybrid battery without the need for electrolyte additives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The removal of trace acetylene from ethylene feedstocks is essential for polyethylene production, yet current hydrogenation catalysts often suffer from over‐hydrogenation or require scarce noble metals. Here, a Pd‐free single‐atom catalyst comprising isolated Ni atoms anchored in zeolite Beta (Ni 1 /BEA) synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation on Na‐exchanged BEA zeolite is reported for selective acetylene hydrogenation. Comprehensive characterization confirmed the atomic dispersion of Ni within the BEA framework, with no evidence of Ni nanoparticle formation. Under optimized conditions (160 °C, H 2 /C 2 H 2 = 16, residence time = 0.46 s), Ni 1 /BEA achieves complete acetylene conversion with 89% ethylene selectivity, which remain stable over 24 hours with no coke formation. Ni 1 /BEA exceeds the TOF C2H2 achieved by previous zeolite‐supported single‐atom nickel catalysts by 12‐fold. Ethylene selectivity improve upon removal of Brønsted acid sites via Na + exchange, suppressing oligomerization. Ni 1 /BEA preserved the catalytic performance under industrially relevant feed containing excess ethylene, achieving 86% ethylene selectivity at full acetylene conversion. Kinetic analysis yielded consistent activation energies (≈67 kJ mol −1 ). TPD studies suggested a non‐associative hydrogenation mechanism in which H 2 activation precedes acetylene adsorption. This work demonstrates Ni 1 /BEA as a stable, cost‐effective, and Pd‐free single‐atom catalyst for acetylene removal in ethylene purification.",

The inclusion of α ‐MoO 3 NW, characterized by strong structural anisotropy, significantly enhances the dielectric properties and promotes improved dipole orientation within the PVDF matrix. These effects collectively lead to increased surface charge density, interfacial polarization, and enhanced β‐ phase crystallinity. The fabricated device, comprising tribopositive aluminum and a tribonegative MoO 3 –PVDF composite membrane, achieves a 3.4 fold increase in output voltage for PVDF with 2 wt.% α‐ MoO 3 loading compared to pristine PVDF, delivering a peak power density of 153.7 µW cm −2 under periodic contact–separation motion with applied force of 4N at a frequency of 4 Hz. Structural and dielectric analyses, including impedance spectroscopy, confirm the formation of strong interfacial coupling and the enhancement of the dielectric constant up to the percolation threshold. Beyond energy harvesting, the TENG exhibits high signal sensitivity and rapid response, enabling its integration into a real‐time Morse code communication system. By converting mechanical taps into distinct electrical pulses, the device effectively encodes and transmits messages, demonstrating its dual functionality in energy generation and low‐power human‐machine interfaces.",

In this study, low‐voltage‐driven rectifying diodes are developed based on CsFAPbI 3 and their voltage tolerance is enhanced by incorporating ionic liquids. The fabricated FTO/TiO 2 /CsFAPbI 3 /Ag diode exhibits a low turn‐on voltage of 181 mV and a high rectifier ratio of 2.8 × 10 4 under 400 mV voltage application, which are superior or comparable to those of reported solution processable diodes.

The persistent increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, driven by industrialization and population growth, has made carbon mitigation an urgent global challenge. Among the most promising strategies to mitigate CO 2 emissions is the catalytic conversion of CO 2 into value‐added chemicals. Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention for their ability to capture and convert CO 2 with high efficiency. Despite their outstanding efficacy, the scalability and chemical stability of MOFs remain challenging. Zinc‐based MOFs exhibit notable chemical stability, attributed to the strong metal‐ligand interactions stemming from zinc's borderline behavior under the hard‐soft acid‐base principle. Zinc‐based MOFs are the first reported and also the earliest employed for CO 2 conversion applications. This review discusses the advancements and achievements of Zn‐MOFs in CO 2 conversion, underlining their roles in producing cyclic carbonates, oxazolidines, N‐formylated compounds, and carboxylic acids. Although Zn‐MOFs have shown excellent catalytic activity under controlled laboratory conditions, real‐world applications require their evaluation under mixed gas streams, moisture, and elevated temperatures.",

Conventional ensemble electrocatalysis often suffers from limited exposure of catalytic sites due to assembly or coverage, resulting in reduced utilization of active sites. In contrast, nanoparticle collision electrocatalysis (NCE), through the freely diffusive collisions of individual nanoparticles onto an ultramicroelectrode, creates a significantly greater number of accessible reaction sites, exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity. In this review, the study begins by outlining the fundamentals of NCE, including its collision electrocatalytic mechanism and enhanced strategies. In the section on collision electrocatalytic mechanism, NCE is systematically compared with conventional ensemble electrocatalysis to highlight the advantages of NCE. Subsequently, in the discussion of enhanced strategies, the roles of ultrasonic dispersion and the integration of hydrodynamic flow within confined microchannels as effective means to improve collision frequency and catalytic performance are presented. Next, the study discusses its applications in electrochemical reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, methanol oxidation reaction, and hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction. Finally, a perspective on future research directions, aiming to offer strategic guidance for the continued development of NCE in the field of electrocatalysis is provided.",

While supercapacitors offer high power density and long cycle life, their practical application is often constrained by complex synthesis processes and non‐renewable components. Biomass‐derived materials, though promising alternatives, generally suffer from limited active sites and poor ion transport capabilities. To overcome these bottlenecks, an innovative strategy is proposed: rapidly synthesizing linden‐based manganese metal–organic frameworks (Mn‐MOFs) at ambient temperature using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma within just 1 h. This method significantly reduces preparation time compared to conventional solvothermal approaches while enhancing interfacial integration between the MnO embedded in the carbon matrix and the hierarchical porous wood framework derived from the MOF. The resulting composite electrode achieves a high specific surface capacitance of 12 295 mF cm −2 at a current density of 5 mA cm −2 , along with outstanding rate performance (6700 mF cm −2 at 50 mA cm −2 ) and excellent cycling stability (91.9% capacity retention after 40 000 cycles).

    "abstract": "Abstract The safety concerns inherent to lithium‐ion batteries constitute a primary technical barrier hindering their large‐scale deployment. Poly(3‐alkylthiophene)s (P3ATs) are promising candidates for thermally responsive electrodes aimed at suppressing thermal runaway owing to their pronounced positive temperature coefficient (PTC) effect. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of how the molecular architecture of p‐type conducting polymers affects their PTC characteristics remains lacking. Herein, P3ATs with varying branched alkyl side‐chains are synthesized, and the influence of different anionic dopants (PF 6 − , ClO 4 − , and TFSI − ) on the PTC switching temperature and resistance ratio is systematically investigated. It is found that polymers with branched side chains doped by smaller anions exhibit higher PTC transition temperatures and larger PTC resistance ratios, which is attributed to enhanced segmental mobility and more efficient dopant dissociation. However, the polymer's resistance ratio decreases with increasing thermal cycles, indicating that the reversibility of its PTC effect weakens as thermal cycling proceeds. Moreover, temperature‐sensitive LiFePO 4 /polymers composite electrodes exhibit an effective current‐interruption capability at 100 °C with reversible PTC effect. These findings establish molecular‐design principles for next‐generation thermally responsive battery materials with intrinsic thermal‐protection functionality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar‐driven CO 2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) processes have emerged as a viable solution for addressing the challenges of CCUS in order to mitigate global warming and climate change. One key advantage of solar‐based systems is their ability to operate using renewable energy, largely eliminating or reducing the need for fossil fuels, which sets them apart from other technologies. This review seeks to gather and assess the key studies outlined in the literature that explore every current solar‐driven CCUS technique. The gathered research articles have been categorized based on their operating conditions and their specific techniques to provide valuable insight into the inner workings of these processes. The reviewed studies aimed to utilize solar energy to capture and convert CO 2 into useful products such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4 ), formic acid (HCOOH), and methanol (CH 3 OH). Regarding the capture methods of this study, solar energy integration in direct air capture (DAC), post‐combustion, pre‐combustion, and oxy‐combustion are considered. DAC offers strategies for carbon reduction from the atmosphere, which are best implemented in supplementary to other strategies aimed at reducing CO 2 levels. Additionally, DAC technologies are confronted with obstacles such as their high energy requirements and their cost‐ineffectiveness. Post‐combustion CO 2 capture generally presents as a more flexible and energy‐efficient method compared to pre‐combustion and oxy‐combustion CO 2 capture. In the sections concerning solar‐driven CO 2 utilization, photocatalytic, thermochemical, and electrochemical methods are reviewed. Photocatalytic CO 2 utilization shows promise as a sustainable approach, and its efficiency depends on a variety of factors, including the choice of photocatalyst, the intensity and wavelength of the light source, and the conditions of the reaction. Additionally, the presence of co‐catalysts or sacrificial agents can play a role in the efficiency of the process. Solar‐thermochemical CO 2 utilization functions at elevated temperatures, enabling the effective and specific conversion of CO 2 with minimal energy requirements. The effectiveness of utilizing CO 2 using solar‐driven electrochemical methods relies on various factors such as photoelectrode design, electrolyte type, specific reaction conditions like temperature and pressure, and the catalysts utilized to enhance CO 2 reduction reactions. Furthermore, CO 2 storage strategies such as oceanic, geological, and carbon mineralization have also been analyzed and evaluated. Here, alongside analytical evaluation of the related studies, a brief discourse on the potential future research avenues is also provided.",

Considering the unique structural characteristics of the freestanding molecular‐cage‐like single clusters, the biogenic realgar structure is utilized as an independent anode unit since each cluster integrates four faceted five‐membered As 4 S 4 rings, providing a short diffusion length into each cluster and facile chemical binding onto the sulfur atoms with lone pairs of electrons.

    "abstract": "Abstract Energy harvesting from photosynthetic membranes, proteins, or bacteria through bio‐photovoltaic or bio‐electrochemical approaches has been proposed as a new route to clean energy. A major shortcoming of these and solar cell technologies is the underutilization of solar irradiation wavelengths in the IR region, especially those in the far IR region. Here, a biohybrid energy‐harvesting device is demonstrated that exploits IR radiation, via convection and thermoelectric effects, to improve the resulting energy conversion performance. A composite of nanocellulose and the conducting polymer system poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is used as the anode in biohybrid cells that includes thylakoid membranes (TMs) and redox mediators (RMs) in solution. By irradiating the conducting polymer electrode by an IR light‐emitting diode, a sixfold enhancement in the harvested bio‐photovoltaic power is achieved, without compromising stability of operation. Investigation of the output currents reveals that IR irradiation generates convective heat transfer in the electrolyte bulk, which enhances the redox reactions of RMs at the anode by suppressing diffusion limitations. In addition, a fast‐transient thermoelectric component, originating from the PEDOT:PSS‐nanocellulose‐electrolyte interphase, further increases the bio‐photocurrent. These results pave the way for the development of energy‐harvesting biohybrids that make use of heat, via IR absorption, to enhance energy conversion efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of copper‐based chemicals to prevent biological growth has been widely practiced in the past. However, leaching of the copper has increased concentrations in ports and marinas, posing a risk to marine life and the environment. It is therefore timely to develop a sustainable antibiofouling coating that could replace conventional copper‐based paints. Herein, the use of cross‐linked polyethylene imine (PEI) coated on conducting carbon cloth electrodes as a material that can absorb copper from seawater and allow for controlled electrochemical release of copper as a biocide to prevent biofouling is proposed. The results show that the porous coating can store and release copper ions over multiple cycles by passing only 1 mA cm −2 current density through the electrode in artificial seawater. This could enable a closed‐cycle, copper‐based antifouling coating, i.e., a coating that uses the well‐established biocidal activity of copper, but without any net release to the ocean.",

Benefitting from the decorated Lewis basic groups, not only the CO 2 adsorption enthalpy and selectivity over CH 4 of NH 2 ‐Zr(H 2 L) and F‐NH 2 ‐Zr(H 2 L) are improved, but also their catalytic activities for cycloaddition of CO 2 to form cyclic carbonates are significantly enhanced. Among them, F‐NH 2 ‐Zr(H 2 L) exhibits the most effective performance for cycloaddition of CO 2 and styrene epoxide, which can be attributed to the strong polarization between the CO 2 molecule and the framework of F‐NH 2 ‐Zr(H 2 L).

Acetone conversion and mesitylene yield increase with temperature and time, while yield of the intermediate mesityl oxide decreases. This effect is also found for higher quantities of catalyst acid sites and is accompanied with an increased side product formation which negatively affects total product selectivity. Analyzing the reaction progress shows a significant drop in catalyst productivity after an initial start‐up phase. This observation is linked to a deactivation of the catalyst which involves water that is formed during the condensation reaction of acetone.

In this work, a novel ternary hybrid material, porous ZnS@Co 3 S 4 @NiO nanosheets are successfully constructed through a morphology reshaping enabled by a hydrothermal method followed by calcination. From a macroscopic view, the introduction of NiO changes the nanorod morphology of ZnS@Co 3 S 4 , and forms a porous nanosheet structure. The porous architecture with an increased specific surface area can promote the transport of ions and electrons, accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte, and offer more active sites for electrochemical reactions. These advantages enhance the electrochemical properties of ZnS@Co 3 S 4 @NiO nanosheets when used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. ZnS@Co 3 S 4 @NiO nanosheets deliver an initial capacitance of 1418.7 F g −1 , and it also reaches 1550.9 F g −1 with a capacitance retention rate of 109.3% at 5 A g −1 , after 5000 cycles.

    "abstract": "Abstract Development of direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) is significantly constrained by low output performance and poor durability because of the sluggish formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) and the poisoning by CO ads intermediate on the Pt‐based electrocatalyst at low operating temperatures. By operating DFAFCs at elevated temperatures, the peak power density (PPD) of the cell based on the Pt/C catalyst increases significantly. For example, the PPD of DFAFC reaches 198 mW cm −2 at 240 °C, eight times higher than that of the DFAFC at 70 °C. The study shows the surprising transition in power performance of DFAFCs at elevated temperatures. The increase of PPD for DFAFC against temperature is 121 mW cm −2 /100 °C at temperatures above 115 °C, almost three times higher than the 45 mW cm −2 /100 °C obtained at lower temperatures. The fundamental reason for the substantially enhanced power output and durability is the gradual transformation of the reaction kinetics from sluggish direct FAOR at low temperatures to fast H 2 oxidation reaction at elevated temperatures due to the increased in situ decomposition of formic acid on Pt/C catalysts at temperatures above 100 °C. This study demonstrates that operation at temperatures above 160 °C is most effective to promote performance and durability of DFAFCs.",

Herein, a versatile and potentially scalable route to gold‐decorated manganese oxide‐based OER electrocatalysts is reported. In particular, Mn x O y (MnO 2 , Mn 2 O 3 ) host matrices are grown on conductive glasses by plasma assisted‐chemical vapor deposition (PA‐CVD), and subsequently functionalized with gold nanoparticles (guest) as OER activators by radio frequency (RF)‐sputtering. The final selective obtainment of MnO 2 ‐ or Mn 2 O 3 ‐based systems is then enabled by annealing under oxidizing or inert atmosphere, respectively. A detailed material characterization evidences the formation of high‐purity Mn x O y dendritic nanostructures with an open morphology and an efficient guest dispersion into the host matrices. The tailoring of Mn x O y phase composition and host–guest interactions has a remarkable influence on OER activity yielding, for the best performing Au/Mn 2 O 3 system, a current density of ≈5 mA cm −2 at 1.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an overpotential close to 300 mV at 1 mA cm −2 . Such results, comparing favorably with literature data on manganese oxide‐based materials, highlight the importance of compositional control, as well as of surface and interface engineering, to develop low‐cost and efficient anode nanocatalysts for water splitting applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recycling spent lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) is an important consideration both to preserve metal resources and to reduce hazardous waste. One recycling method is to extract lithium and cobalt ions using organic solvents that contain battery components. However, it is hard to achieve the complete separation of metal ions and this also requires multiple steps. Herein, functionalized polymeric resins are reported, that can capture both lithium and cobalt ions from organic solutions and separate them chromatographically. Specifically, Merrifield resin is functionalized with oligoethylene glycol derivatives, which are structurally similar to crown‐ethers. To test the lithium‐ion depletion, these resins are incubated with bulk solutions of lithium cations at ≈50 ppm in acetonitrile. The results showed 30–45% depletion after filtration in optimal cases. To test this polymer support for chromatographic separation and check the potential for LIB recycling, a column is packed with the functionalized resin beads, and a mixture of lithium (≈200 ppm) and cobalt (≈200 ppm) ions is loaded. The column can achieve baseline separation of these ions and can be used multiple times without degradation. These results suggest that the current solvent extraction steps during recycling processes can be greatly simplified.",

Here, a simple scalable bottom up approach consisting of wet‐chemical synthesis method is used to produce the atomically thin (2D)‐wurtzite ZnO: “wurtzene.” The presence of a large number of well‐distributed surface defects in the synthesized wurtzene promotes the separation of charge carriers in it via the excellent piezo‐photocatalytic activity and thereby the efficiency of degradation of a test dye (namely methylene blue) is enhanced by ≈5 times. By taking an innovative approach, a piezoelectric driven power cell is also fabricated by using the wurtzene and the highest open circuit voltage is found out to be ≈40 V at 1.0 kPa of applied periodic pressure. The experimental observations are explained with density functional theory calculation. The confinement effect due to reduced dimension plays a crucial role in the wurtzene's excellent piezoelectric response. It is envisioned that the present findings will provided a clear insight into the synthesis of wurtzene with surface defects for highly efficient sunlight driven photocatalytic activity as well as piezoelectric energy harvesting.",

Thus, numerous researchers have devoted their efforts to mitigate iridium corrosion by decoration with corrosion-resistant metal oxides and/or supports to maximize OER catalyst durability whilst retaining high activity. Herein a one-step, facile electrochemical route to obtain improved IrOx thin film OER stability in acid by decorating with amorphous tungsten sulphide (WS3−x) upon electrochemical decomposition of a [WS4]2− aqueous precursor is proposed. The rationale behind applying such WS3−x decoration stems from the generation of a tungsten oxide phase, a well-known corrosion-resistant photoactive OER catalyst. The study demonstrates the viability of the proposed WS3−x decoration, allowing the tailoring of experimental parameters responsible for WS3−x nanoparticle size and surface coverage. OER stability tests coupled by ex situ SEM and XPS corroborate the beneficial effect of WS3−x decoration, yielding improved OER specific activity metrics along with minimized Ir surface roughening, a characteristic of electrodissolution. Iridium decoration with electrodeposited, corrosion-resistant oxides is consequently shown to be a promising route to maximize OER stabilities.",

Several functional interfaces between living plants and nanotechnology have been successfully reported for diverse applications, from sensing to photosynthesis and energy production and from modulation of physiological activity to controlled delivery of chemicals. In this work, a photoactive, biohybrid interface based on a prototypical semiconducting polymer, sensitive to green light, and Arabidopsis thaliana plants is reported. Optical excitation of polymer beads is shown to deterministically regulate the Arabidopsis stomatal aperture, the leaf pores which regulate the plant carbon dioxide uptake, oxygen release, and transpiration processes. Moreover, it is observed that excitation of bio‐polymer hybrid interfaces optically modulates the cytosolic calcium ions concentration, which is involved, as a second messenger, in the regulation of stomatal movements. The results support the possibility to employ light‐responsive organic materials to regulate on demand the physiological activity of plant systems, in a drug‐free, touchless, and easily controllable way. When transferred to the field, this strategy may represent an innovative approach to optimize the exchange of gases and water loss of plants, and to improve the plant resilience toward environmental constraints.",

Herein, a novel copper‐cerium mixed metal oxide is fabricated via a controllable surface deposition route, showing excellent catalytic performance in CO 2 hydrogenation. Of particular note, among the various samples with tunable Cu/Ce molar ratios, the obtained CuO x ‐5CeO 2 containing 0.42% Ce exhibits the highest catalytic activity with ≈31% CO 2 conversion and 98% CO selectivity at 380 °C, as well as an excellent stability for 50 h. The as‐prepared catalysts are then characterized by H 2 ‐temperature‐programmed reduction, CO 2 ‐termperature programmed desorption, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy to explore the possible reaction pathways. The results indicate the significance of the interactions between CuO x and CeO 2 , which can facilitate the activation of H 2 and CO 2 simultaneously, to promote the formation of formate intermediates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ni‐rich layered oxides have been considered one of the most promising cathode materials for lithium‐ion batteries on account of their high reversible capacity. However, their chemical sensitivity to moisture and carbon dioxide results in the formation and growth of residual lithium compounds, leading to a deterioration in electrochemical performance and difficulty in cathode electrode preparation. In this work, a passivation coating of polydimethylsiloxane with 5 molecular layers is successfully coated on LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 particles. To examine the hydrophobicity of polydimethylsiloxane, bare and coated NCM811 are exposed to a hot and humid chamber for dozens of hours, even exposure to damp air over 120 h. The results indicate that the hydrophobic coating can inhibit the formation and growth of residual lithium compounds on the surface of LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 , resulting in slightly less degradation in electrochemical performance. Herein, a rapid, low‐cost, and easily employed method to generate an even hydrophobic/passivation surface is developed, which provides a generic approach to treat various electrode materials, especially nanosized and water‐sensitive ones, to improve their tolerance to extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plasmonic organic polymers with strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR) hold exciting prospects in various fields but are challenging to synthesize. Herein, SPR is successfully constructed on carbon nitride polymers by photoelectron accumulation for enhanced photocatalysis. NCN‐modification on carbon nitride causes the separated highest occupied molecular orbit/lowest unoccupied molecular orbit distribution in its electronic structure for efficient charge separation. Long‐lived photoelectron accumulation on NCN‐modified carbon nitride polymer (NCN‐CN x ) is observed by single‐particle photoluminescence spectroscopy, causing strong SPR absorption in the 500–800 nm spectral region. Electron‐density‐dependent SPR of NCN‐CN x is highly sensitive to oxygen, making it a plasmonic sensor for oxygen detection. The positive roles of SPR in greatly promoting photoreactions over NCN‐CN x are demonstrated by NH 3 BH 3 decomposition, and 13 mL h −1 hydrogen is generated under &gt; 500 nm light irradiation, five‐fold higher than that of non‐plasmonic H 2 N‐CN x . Moreover, SPR of NCN‐CN x can greatly promote photocatalytic hydrogen generation to be 1.1 mmol g −1 (3 h) under &gt; 500 nm irradiation and the synergy between intrinsic bands and SPR excitation boosts 3.1 mmol g −1 (3 h) hydrogen generation under &gt; 400 nm irradiation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Molecular solar‐thermal systems (MOST) have emerged in these last years as a novel concept to store solar light. They rely on two state molecular switches that can absorb a photon to convert the initial state A to a higher‐in‐energy state B. The chemical energy stored by B can be then released to reconstitute A. Although simple in its principle, an optimal MOST needs to satisfy several requirements: incoming photon energy in the solar spectrum range, high photoreaction quantum yield, high storage density, no degradation. The first challenge is therefore the search for molecular switches that accomplish all such properties. Until now, trial‐and‐error experiments have been performed, led by physicochemical intuition. The result is that most of the initially proposed switches have been abandoned in favor of the preferred norbornadiene/quadricyclane system, together with its derivatives. Nevertheless, most of the solar spectrum is still out of the MOST absorption region, hence requiring novel approaches. Here, it is shown how mechanochemistry can be applied to improve the principally desired characteristics of a MOST: photon absorption energy, storage energy, and thermal B‐to‐A energy barrier. It is especially shown how azobenzene—a paradigmatic photoswitch still attracting much attention—can be proposed, within certain limits, as a MOST when applying external forces.",

The authors assess the performance of dissolved mucin for Hg 2+ adsorption through studies of kinetics, capacity, and selectivity. The results show that mucin can adsorb more than 124 mg g −1 Hg 2+ while exhibiting ultra‐fast kinetics, with an equilibrium reached in a few seconds. The adsorption levels are optimized in pHs higher than 4 and remain almost unchanged in the presence of background ions. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared analyses indicated that the sorption mechanism is dominated by electrostatic interactions and mercuric complexation with mucin's active sites, whereas the undesirable removal via mercuric reduction does not occur. To use mucin in a practical and green fashion for metal adsorption, mucin‐based solid structures, including films, beads, and nanofibers (NFs), are fabricated and assessed. Of these structures, the NFs show the best performance, with an uptake over 109 mg g −1 and a high structural stability over multiple adsorption and regeneration cycles. The findings point to the potential use of mucin as a future green alternative for metal biosorption for environmental applications.",

Furthermore, organic‐inorganic hybrid heterojunctions based on these CPPs and TiO 2 as inorganic semiconductor are prepared ( CPP‐FPA@T‐10 and CPP‐PA@T‐10 , with the polymer loading ≈10 wt.%). The photonic efficiency for H 2 photoproduction is 33% higher when the CPP has fluorine atoms. This enhancement is even higher in presence of 1 wt.% platinum as co‐catalyst. Thus, the Pt/CPP‐FPA@T‐10 hybrid (≈31.7 mmol g –1 h –1 and 11.7% of photonic efficiency) presents H 2 production nearly twice than that of the nonfluorinated hybrid Pt/CPP‐PA@T‐10 (≈16.6 mmol g –1 h –1 and 6.1% of photonic efficiency) and 3.5‐times higher than that of the Pt/TiO 2 (≈8.9 mmol g –1 h –1 and 3.29% of photonic efficiency) photocatalyst. Charge dynamics studies show that both hybrid heterojunctions exhibit a direct Z‐scheme charge transfer mechanism, and the presence of fluorine atoms in the CPP structure leads to an increasing charge separation lifetime which is in accordance with the better performance in H 2 production. These findings on fluorine doping provide essential clues for the design of structure electronic engineered CPPs for energy conversion and storage technologies.",

For renewable methanol synthesis, membrane reactors (MR) have been tested on a laboratory‐scale with promising results. However, membrane performance requirements that allow an economic benefit for their large‐scale deployment are missing. Therefore, a 1D Python MR model is coupled with an AspenPlus process simulation to conduct a techno‐economic assessment with focus on membrane performance. Two synthesis loop configurations are investigated: one where feed and sweep recycle are operated at the same pressure and one where the sweep recycle operates at atmospheric pressure. The results show that both configurations can offer technical benefits, if sufficiently high product separation can be achieved, but that for a compressed sweep recycle no economic benefits are possible. As a consequence, membranes used for methanol synthesis must endure operation at high pressure differences. Furthermore, the results highlight the critical role of the H 2 permeance, which should remain below 1 × 10 −9 mol m −2 s −1 Pa −1 . From an economic standpoint high water permeation has a more beneficial effect than high methanol permeation.",

The g‐C 3 N 4 nanosheets are uniformly wrapped on the surface of lignin fibers, and t‐FeC 2 O 4 is loaded between them.

Not only can it effectively solve the problem of excessive agglomeration and oxidation of nZVI, but also the synergistic effect of bimetallic coordination formation and the excellent electron transfer ability of graphene are beneficial to enhance the reactivity of FeNi@GR.

One of the strategies to mitigate capacity fade is applying a coating on LMO particle surfaces. While this approach yields promising results, there is limited understanding of mechanisms whereby coatings improve LMO capacity retention. Herein, the effects of a new protective coating material, La 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3 (LSCO), in a thin‐film battery geometry that is amenable to fundamental studies of electrode processes, are reported. RF sputtering deposition is used to produce high quality 25–100 nm LMO cathodes on Al 2 O 3 substrates with an intervening Pt/Ti back‐side contact layer. Cycling of the un‐coated cathodes results in capacity loss of 18% over 300 cycles. Adding a 2 nm LSCO layer reduces the capacity loss to 3%. While this may be due in part to reduced Mn dissolution, scanning transmission electron microscopy results indicate that the coating helps to preserve crystallinity and reduce lattice structure distortion due to inhibited formation of defect tetragonal spinel. Three‐electrode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results reveal that the LSCO coating increases charge transfer and ohmic resistances, but the increases are generally too small to significantly impact cell performance even at high C‐rates.",

Substituting the Mg site with Mn in Mg 3.2 Bi 1.4 Sb 0.59 Se 0.01 changes the dominant carrier scattering mechanism from a mixed scattering of acoustic phonons and ionized impurities to acoustic phonon scattering. Mn doping in Mg 3.2 Bi 1.4 Sb 0.59 Se 0.01 also enhances the mobility to 180 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , reduces the thermal conductivity, and significantly increases the quality factor β of the material. The high room temperature thermoelectric performance of n‐type Mn&amp;Se co‐doped Mg 3 (Bi, Sb) 2 ‐based materials makes them a highly competitive substitute for commercialized n‐type Bi 2 Te 3 .",

It is shown that the simultaneous UV–vis irradiation of both materials leads to better H 2 production (ca. 925 and 827 µmol g −1 h −1 by IEP‐15@T‐10 and IEP‐14@T‐10, 12 and 11‐fold higher production than bare TiO 2 ) than the solely irradiation at visible of the CPPs (ca. 124 and 90 µmol g −1 h −1 by IEP‐15@T‐10 and IEP‐14@T‐10 when TiO 2 is photocatalytically inactive). The reason is attributed to the charge‐transfer mechanisms that occur between the counterparts of the hybrid material: in the first case it consists in a Z‐scheme charge transfer mechanism, while in the second one is a sensitization charge transfer mechanism. Both mechanisms are elucidated by advanced techniques. Furthermore, in a gas phase CO 2 photoreduction test, IEP‐15@T‐10 shows sixfold higher CH 4 evolution than TiO 2 , which result in a selectivity shift from CO to CH 4 (i.e., &gt;26% greater selectivity than bare TiO 2 ) .",

    "abstract": "Abstract LiCoO 2 is one of the most extensively deployed cathode materials in commercial lithium‐ion batteries. However, it remains a challenge to fulfill the potential specific capacity of LiCoO 2 during long‐term cycling, due to the lattice degradations in deep delithiation states. Herein, a dual doping scheme based on Ru and Al is explored, which improves the cyclability of LiCoO 2 at high voltages through synergistically reconfiguring electronic structure and stabilizing lattice structure. It is well known that the doped Al will serve as a strong positively charged center and restrain the lattice distortion. The doping of Ru suppresses the occupied O:2p states below Fermi level and stabilizes oxygen redox during cycling. The proposed dual doping strategy improves the accessible energy density and cyclability of LiCoO 2 at increased voltages significantly. For example, the dual doped LiCoO 2 performs 19% higher energy density at 4.57 V versus Li + /Li than the pristine one. In addition, an initial capacity of 197 mAh g −1 and 86% capacity retention after 100 cycles are achieved from 3.00 to 4.53 V versus Li + /Li. This study sheds a light on the fundamental principles for the development of high‐voltage LiCoO 2 and other layered oxide cathode materials with high energy density and excellent cyclability.",

The rotating structure‐based TENG exhibits superior output performance and energy conversion efficiency. However, further improvement is required in terms of output performance, and the issue of serious friction and wear between the materials in the friction layer needs to be addressed. In this work, A coaxial double‐rotation soft‐contact material based TENG (DR‐TENG) with characteristics of low wear and high output is fabricated. The introduction of soft‐contact material reduces frictional resistance and material wear, while the design and optimization of double‐rotation structures further enhance the output performance of TENG. The output current of DR‐TENG using rabbit furs as friction material can reach 144 µA after rectification. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent power supply capability of DR‐TENG. The output of DR‐TENG can be used to power commercial electronic devices after being stored by capacitance. The DR‐TENG is successfully applied for cathodic protection. The outcomes reveal that the open‐circuit potential of Q235 carbon steel can be reduced by 500 mV, which has a remarkable anti‐corrosion effect. These results confirm the broad application prospects of TENG in metal corrosion protection.",

The prepared CDs, NM and NM‐CDs combination is examined through various techniques. The prepared CDs selectively detect Cr 6+ , Ru 3+ , and Doxycycline independently. Also, in this work, a groundbreaking strategy is found to prepare morphology‐tailored NM using CDs through a solid‐state grinding method without adding any other toxic solvents or reagents. The CDs‐induced NM‐CDs (15) look like a 2D nano‐sheet with enriched surface area compared to its bare NM. The fabricated electrode provides the highest capacitance value of 1947 F g −1 , almost three times grander than the bare 1D rod‐like electrode. Then, fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor NM‐CDs (15)//AC system delivers a high energy density of 43.9 Wh Kg −1 at a power density of 684 W Kg −1 .

To summarize and update these advanced studies, this paper introduces the latest progress in photocatalytic membranes including discussing the differences of photocatalytic mechanism between free and fixed photocatalytic systems and the design philosophy of photocatalytic membranes. At the same time, some common fabrication methods, including in situ growth, coating, spinning, casting, and foaming methods are analyzed. Besides, the photocatalytic performances of different photocatalytic membranes in the actual environment and their use conditions are explored. Finally, a critical view of future trends is included. The explanation of the photocatalytic mechanism, large‐scale production, and the practicality of photocatalytic products are all problems that need to be solved in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To fully manifest the high energy densities of lithium−oxygen (Li−O 2 ) batteries, bifunctional catalytic cathodes that efficiently facilitate both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are mandatorily required. However, catalysts with intrinsic bifunctional catalytic activities are limited in practice. In addition, the practical utilization rate of oxygen catalytic cathodes is usually lower due to the deposition of insoluble discharge product Li 2 O 2 . To address these issues, this work proposes a grafted hybrid nanosheet array architecture to enable efficient bifunctional oxygen catalytic cathodes for Li−O 2 batteries. As a demonstration, Co 3 O 4 nanosheet arrays (MnO 2 −Co 3 O 4 @CC) grafted with MnO 2 nanosheets are prepared on carbon cloth by facile electrodeposition followed by calcination in air. The mutually perpendicular Co 3 O 4 and MnO 2 nanosheets in the grafted architecture enable both the ORR catalytically active site of MnO 2 and the OER catalytically active site of Co 3 O 4 easily accessible during repeated cycling. Thus, the synergistic bifunctional catalysis of hybrid MnO 2 −Co 3 O 4 @CC is effectively realized to deliver a high specific capacity of 8115 mA h g −1 and a low overall overpotential of 0.64 V. This work provides a universal and effective approach for fabricating various efficient catalytic electrodes via the facile integration of different nanomaterials on nanoarray architectures.",

The hydrothermal treatment does not affect the catalyst crystalline structure, morphology, nor the surface area.

The ORR performance of these catalysts is investigated across different annealing temperatures. The catalysts’ shape and structure are validated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), revealing that changes in annealing temperature affect morphology and nitrogen‐containing functional groups of the catalyst. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) studies demonstrated that Fe(FcP) 800 ‐N‐C@Aerogel catalysts exhibit excellent performance, with a half‐wave potential of 0.687 V and an average electron transfer number of 3.98 under acidic conditions. These findings suggest a near‐four‐electron reaction pathway, highlighting the catalyst's strong ORR activity, high efficiency, and durability, with only 17.4 mV LSV curve decay after 10,000 cycles. In conclusion, Fe(FcP) x ‐N‐C@Aerogel advances ORR catalysis in acidic media by delivering exceptional performance and durability, driven by its innovative architecture and precisely engineered active sites, setting a new benchmark for high‐efficiency energy conversion.",

For ‘smart’ or knowledge‐based design of photocatalysts, it is, however, important to understand the adsorption and degradation dynamics and their relationship with the particulate surface. Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) can provide relevant information about the particle surface characteristics in dispersions. Herein, HSPs of six different titania materials including their composites with graphene are determined and they are related to the adsorption capacities of Bisphenol A and chloroform. The effect of the underlying synthesis procedures and graphene addition on the pollutant adsorption in the liquid phase is examined. The results show that the Hansen sphere radii correlate with the specific equilibrium adsorption capacities of the titania‐based substrates for both pollutants. The type of crystallographic structure and the addition of graphene increase the adsorption dynamics and are accurately correlated with the HSP sphere radii. HSPs can thus serve as a characterization method for understanding liquid pollutant adsorption or, set in a wider context, the interaction of ligands or surface groups with a specific particle surface.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have attracted extensive attention due to the high volumetric capacity and natural abundance of magnesium (Mg) metal anode. However, the Mg metal anode in ether‐based electrolyte systems often suffers from surface passivation, leading to the irreversible plating/stripping behavior of Mg. In this work, for the first time, an effective strategy is proposed to modify the Mg metal anode by in situ alloy formation using a chlorine‐free organic metal compound, triphenyl bismuth (TPB). Through electrochemical reduction, an Mg‐Bi alloy forms uniformly on the Mg metal anode surface, providing abundant nucleation sites for Mg, allowing for smooth and stable Mg deposition and suppressing the occurrence of short circuits. In a 1,2‐dimethoxyethane (DME)‐based electrolyte system, the addition of TPB significantly improves the electrochemical performance of Mg anode, enabling stable cycling for up to 170 h at a low overpotential. Similarly, in the tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4) electrolyte system, excellent performance is observed, achieving stable cycling of 240 h. This work confirms the feasibility of using chlorine‐free organic metal additives to improve the Mg anode interface and provides new possibilities for enhancing the practical applications of RMBs.",

This understanding can facilitate the design and development of novel metal‐free carbon‐based materials with desirable catalytic properties from industrial lignin waste. In this research, phosphorus (P) or nitrogen (N) atoms are incorporated into sulfur (S)‐doped porous carbon using a highly effective collosol doping carbonization method, which alters the electronic configuration of the active sites and enhances catalytic performance. The P and S co‐doped porous carbon (SPC) demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA), reaching a high conversion rate of 96.6% within 2 h and benzaldehyde (BAD) yield of 92.5%, along with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 8.6 × 10 −3 mol·g −1 ·h −1 . It also exhibits strong catalytic selectivity for other functionalized alcohols. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) indicate that the incorporation of P or N atom into S‐doped porous carbon increases the electron density at the Fermi level and modifies Mulliken charge distributions at the active sites, enhancing cooperative electron regulation and catalytic activity, particularly in the P and S co‐doping structures. These findings offer guidance for the design of advanced metal‐free carbon catalysts.",

MXenes are rapidly budding as promising candidates for advanced energy carrier and storage systems. Ti‐based MXenes have been widely studied; however, their conductivity is relatively low compared to niobium‐based MXenes. In this work, the etching process is optimized to successfully remove Al from the Nb MAX phase, thereby developing a well‐exfoliated Nb‐MXene (NbX). Furthermore, to enhance the overall electrochemical performance, a novel catalyst is introduced by depositing nickel‐cobalt sulfide (NCS) onto NbX (NCS@NbX) to improve its activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The resulting catalyst achieves impressive overpotentials of 115 and 130 mV in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 and 1 m KOH for HER and OER, respectively, nearly three times lower than the values observed for pristine NbX. Electrochemical testing further reveals low Tafel slopes of 93 and 98 mV dec⁻¹ for HER and OER, respectively. The catalyst also exhibits remarkable stability analyzed with the help of chronoamperometry testing, maintaining performance for over 40 h in acidic and 20 h in basic conditions, highlighting its robustness.",

The fine‐tuning of preparative parameters has a significant impact on energy‐storing performance, with deposition time appearing as a crucial parameter in enhancing their electrochemical properties. This work offers a simple and scalable method for the preparation of manganese ferrite with varying deposition times using chemical bath deposition (CBD). Varying deposition time results in a transformation from the manganese ferrite hydrate (MnFe 2 O 4 .H 2 O) to manganese ferrite (MnFe 2 O 4 ) cubic structure and alteration in morphology from tetrahedral crystals to octahedral‐like in MnFe 2 O 4 series thin films (C‐MFO). The MnFe 2 O 4 electrode with an optimal deposition time of 7 h (C‐MFO3) sample, featuring a cube‐like morphology, achieves a maximum specific capacitance ( C s) of 491.2 F g −1 at 1.5 A g −1 , maintaining 81.1% retention. Furthermore, the constructed hybrid supercapacitor device (HSD) exhibits a high C s of 73.3 F g −1 , along with a specific energy (SE) of 36.7 Wh kg −1 at a specific power (SP) of 1.7 kW kg −1 .

    "abstract": "Abstract High‐entropy alloy nanowires (HEA NWs) hold significant promise for achieving exceptional catalytic activity and stability, owing to their unique 1D morphology and the electronic engineering potential of the HEAs. However, the controlled synthesis of HEA NWs remains a challenge. In this work, a novel wet‐chemical approach is reported for the synthesis of ultrathin HEA NWs, represented by PtRuNiCuPb, through an active‐hydrogen (H·)‐mediated reduction mechanism. The H· species, generated by organic dehydrogenation, facilitate the effective co‐reduction of metal salts with differing reduction potentials, while the mild synthesis conditions ensure morphology control toward nanowire formation. The resulting PtRuNiCuPb HEA NWs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media, due to their multimetallic compositions and abundant grain boundaries. At 50 mV, the specific and mass activities reach 8.46 mA cm −2 and 5.54 A mg Pt+Ru −1 , respectively, ≈11.3 and 14.5 times greater than those of commercial Pt/C. Thanks to the unique 1D morphology, the PtRuNiCuPb HEA nanowires demonstrate excellent catalytic stability, retaining 97% of their initial mass activity after 20000 cycles of accelerated durability testing. These findings offer a promising strategy for designing highly efficient and durable catalysts using HEA compositions and 1D morphologies for electrocatalytic applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Reactive carbon capture (RCC) by direct conversion of CO 2 capture solutions has emerged as a promising alternative to gas‐fed electrolyzers. Leveraging bicarbonate electrolyzers (BEs), RCC eliminates energy‐intensive steps such as CO 2 regeneration and pressurization. Additionally, BEs prevent failures like carbonate salt deposition common in gas‐fed systems. However, intrinsic challenges in BEs, such as higher cell voltages and lower faradaic efficiencies (FEs), result in greater energy consumption during electrolysis compared to gas‐fed electrolyzers. To evaluate whether an RCC chain (RCCC) is more energy‐efficient for formate production than a gas‐fed carbon chain (GFCC), the study optimizes the BE configuration and compares it to a valorization chain requiring a pure, pressurized CO 2 stream for gas‐fed electrolyzers. This study shows the most efficient BE setup employs a cation exchange membrane paired with a buffer layer, achieving a FE for formate of ≈75% at a current density of 100 mA cm⁻ 2 and a cell potential of 3.1 V. Using this optimized BE, the RCCC demonstrates an energetic advantage over GFCCs in scenarios without CO 2 recycling. Even with 100% CO 2 utilization enabled by recycling systems, RCCC remains competitive. With potential improvements in BE performance, RCCC emerges as a promising strategy for converting CO 2 into formate efficiently.",

Importantly, the surface reconstruction upon some catalysts may lead to a misinterpretation of the true active centers, thereby impeding the rational design of catalysts. Consequently, understanding the dynamic evolution of catalyst surface reconstruction during OER is essential. This paper reviews the recent research progress on the surface reconstruction of both precious‐metal and non‐precious‐metal catalysts across wide pH, i.e., under acidic and alkaline conditions, and highlights the differences between them. In addition, an analysis of the underlying causes for catalyst surface reconstruction and the impact factors that greatly influence these processes are presented. Finally, based on these discussions, perspectives for the rational design of OER catalysts are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Silicon‐carbon (Si/C) materials are promising anode candidates for next‐generation lithium‐ion batteries due to their high theoretical specific capacity and excellent cycling stability. However, Si/C anodes suffer from severe irreversible capacity loss during the first charge‐discharge cycle, stemming from silicon's extreme volumetric expansion (up to 300%) during lithiation, which triggers repeated rupture and reformation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, depleting active lithium reserves. To address this, pre‐lithiation is implemented by pressing lithium strips onto the Si/C anode surface to compensate for active lithium and enhance initial Coulombic efficiency. However, overcompensation can cause capacity loss and safety risks. Thus, 2‐acrylamido‐2‐methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS) is introduced as an auxiliary material. AMPS promotes stable SEI formation, reduces its repeated rupture, and consumes excess active lithium during pre‐lithiation. Experimental results show that the AMPS‐treated pre‐lithiated Si/C anode achieves an initial Coulombic efficiency of 91.24% (up from 77.47%) and maintains 83.8% capacity retention after 180 cycles. These findings highlight AMPS's role in improving pre‐lithiation effects and enhancing the electrochemical performance of Si/C anodes.",

However, several researchers report that rechargeable batteries using MoS 2 often exhibit a discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g −1 that exceeds the theoretical discharge capacity. Although various speculations are proposed, only a limited number of reports have provided practical evidence. One reason is that the cleaning process of the electrolyte is essential for spectroscopically analyzing the electrodes used for the battery with liquid electrolyte. On the other hand, all‐solid‐state rechargeable batteries make it possible to analyze MoS 2 spectroscopically without washing processes. In this study, a MoS 2 electrode with high dispersion in solid‐state rechargeable batteries is successfully fabricated by using one‐pot one‐step liquid‐phase mixing methods, which realize exfoliating MoS 2 , synthesizing solid electrolytes, and compositing with conductive agents in a single step. Furthermore, the reason for the extra capacity is investigated to exceed the theoretical capacity by using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis without washing treatment. The underpotentially deposited lithium metal is observed onto the metallic molybdenum generated by the conversion reaction of the MoS 2 electrode during discharging and is clarified to play an important role in the process of the discharge capacity exceeding the theoretical capacity of the MoS 2 electrode.",

The hydrophilic porous membrane is sparse and nonpolar, which are features opposite to those seen in the anion‐exchange membranes commonly used as the diaphragm in CO 2 electrolysis cells. These characteristics result in high ion permeability and water penetration, which contribute to decreased power consumption and prevention of salt precipitation. A cell with an active area of 16 cm 2 is found to achieve a high Faradaic efficiency of 90% at a current density of 1000 mA cm −2 and a lower cell voltage compared with anion‐exchange membranes by applying pressure to prevent gas/liquid crossover. The energy efficiency attained ≈50% at 200 mA cm −2 under neutral electrolyte conditions. The cell exhibits excellent durability against the introduction of impurity gases, with no serious decreases in efficiency found in a 1000 h test at 400 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, a CO 2 electrolysis cell scaled up to a 10 × 100 cm 2 cell stack is demonstrated as a step toward the development of an industrial‐scale CO 2 electrolysis cell. These results suggest that the hydrophilic porous membrane is a promising diaphragm option for the practical application of CO 2 electrolyzers.",

Compared with indirect method where Ca(OH) 2 is first converted into CaO and then uptakes CO 2 , direct CO 2 uptake by Ca(OH) 2 occurs at lower temperature, leading to slighter sintering. However, the direct CO 2 uptake capacity of Ca(OH) 2 should be further enhanced. In this study, Ca(OH) 2 is doped with Mn to improve its direct CO 2 uptake capacity in carbonation‐calcination‐hydration cycles. The cyclic tests are conducted in a triple fixed‐bed reactor. The mechanism of CO 2 adsorbed on Mn‐modified Ca(OH) 2 is determined by density functional theory calculations. In the first cycle, Mn‐modified sorbents acquire highest carbonation conversion at 400 °C, which is 40 °C lower than Ca(OH) 2 . The modified Ca(OH) 2 with Ca/Mn molar ratio of 100:0.75 exhibits the best performance, and its carbonation conversions reach 0.76 and 0.59 in the 1st and 20th cycles, respectively, which are 28% and 18% higher than those of Ca(OH) 2 . Furthermore, carbonation conversion of this Mn‐modified Ca(OH) 2 decreases by within 1.00% from cycle 5 to 20. Mn addition boots oxygen vacancy, increases the surface area and pore volume, and reduces the energy barrier for carbonation of Ca(OH) 2 . Mn‐modified Ca(OH) 2 as CO 2 sorbent appears promising.",

A carbon nanotube (CNT) conductive network is in situ constructed on the surface of lithium manganese oxide (LMO) by freeze‐drying, which has both support and ion transport functions. The unique characteristics of 1D conductive materials effectively avoid the interlayer stacking effect of 2D materials, reduce internal resistance, and improve charge and discharge performance. It is worth noting that the active material content of the composite electrode exceeds 90%, and less conductive material is required, thereby reducing costs. The composite electrode achieves an extremely high load of up to 45 mg cm −2 and a discharge specific capacity of 125 mAh g −1 , giving full play to the charge and discharge specific capacity of LMO, so that the actual specific capacity reaches 84.5% of the ideal specific capacity. Moreover, this preparation process is simpler and more controllable than traditional slurry coating and drying methods, and can be produced on a large scale and at low cost, with strong practical application potential.",

Herein, a ternary nanocomposite subsumed of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), and gold nanorods (AuNRs) is synthesized and effectively deployed to remove plastics from water as well as degradation of polymer film by both chemically and photocatalytically. The hydrothermally prepared nanocomposite completely removes polystyrene molecules from water, and 1.2 mg of plastic degradation is observed during the photolysis. Conversely, chemical degradation pathway induces the weight loss of 10.7 mg. Both Plasmon‐induced interfacial charge transfer transition (PICTT) and Plasmon‐induced hot electron transfer (PHET) assist the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that collectively degrades the polymer strands. The spectrochemical and microscopic studies validate the degradation studies with cautious conclusions.",

Specifically, MOF‐303 is synthesized and used to modify biocomposite coatings mainly derived from natural bio‐polyol castor oil, which improved the controlled release performance through unique self‐assembling and pore‐forming properties of MOF‐303. Characterization confirmed the successful incorporation of MOF‐303 into the bio‐based coatings, resulting in a smoother surface and fewer pores. Specifically, MOF‐303 is synthesized and used to modify biocomposite coatings mainly derived from castor oil, which enhanced the controlled‐release performance by adjusting the pore structure of the coating. The modified CRFs demonstrated improved controlled‐release performance, with nitrogen (N) release periods extending from 63 days in unmodified coatings to 77 and 105 days with 1% and 1.5% MOF‐303, respectively. Application trials on potted spinach revealed significant benefits, with yield increases of 37.51% and 30.83% under U and M1 treatment, respectively.

In this study, key physical properties, including density, viscosity, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity are experimentally measured and simulated for three different metallocene‐catalyzed poly‐α‐olefin (mPAO) with different branch lengths and numbers. The results indicate minimal differences in density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity, but a significant change in the viscosity, with longer and more branched molecules exhibiting higher viscosity. A comparative analysis with common coolants highlights mPAO's superior heat transfer and environmental attributes, positioning it as a competitive environmentally friendly coolant. Using molecular dynamics simulations, mPAO's convective heat transfer behavior of mPAOs in nanochannels is examined to discover enhanced convective heat transfer with increased wall‐liquid atomic interactions and reduced liquid inter‐molecular interactions. These enhancements arise from the denser atomic arrangement in the liquid and closer proximity to the wall. The results indicate that for forced convection under laminar flow in smooth‐walled nanochannels, the Nusselt number depends only on the normalized Kapitza length.

Up to now the mostly explored catalysts applied to ECH are mainly based on Pt, yet the faradaic efficiency (FE) of Pt‐catalyzed ECH of phenolic compounds remains relatively low, owing to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles supported on rutile TiO 2 nanowires substrate (Pt@TiO 2 ) is elaborately constructed to regulate the electronic structure of active Pt species through metal‐support interaction. The oxygen vacancy‐rich TiO 2 nanowire is conducive to the anchoring of Pt, thus preventing the aggregation of small‐sized Pt nanoparticles, while the interaction between Pt nanoparticles and TiO 2 support stimulates the electrons transfer from TiO 2 to Pt, enhances the adsorption of phenol and maximizes the hydrogen utilization toward ECH rather than recombination to trigger HER. As a result, the optimized Pt@TiO 2 electrocatalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for phenol ECH to cyclohexanol with a high selectivity of 93% and appealing FE of 57%. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the optimization of interfacial electronic structure, thus evidently promoting reactants absorption and activation on the Pt@TiO 2 .",

By modulating key properties: i) crystalline structure, ii) bimetallic phase dispersion, iii) basic site density, and iv) reducibility, a correlation with catalytic activity is established. Prereduction at 600 °C revealed that increasing NiCo content promotes partial reduction, which intensifies as metal‐matrix interactions weaken, at the expense of basic sites. CO chemisorption experiments confirmed the presence of both semi‐oxidized (M n+ ) and reduced (M 0 ) metal states, with smaller active‐phase loadings favoring highly dispersed particles rich in M n+ . These particles exhibited strong interfacial interactions that resisted full metal reduction. Optimal catalytic performance is achieved with 20–30 wt.% NiCo, with an optimal amount of M 0 /M n+ , yielding complete ethanol conversion and 60% selectivity to H 2 at 400 °C, as validated by DRIFT and GC analyses. Post‐reaction characterizations highlighted the formation of carbonaceous deposits, which are mitigated by small particle sizes and a high O II /O I ratio, as determined by XPS. These findings provide a roadmap for tailoring catalytic systems to maximize efficiency in OSRE applications.",

However, it is still difficult to achieve CO 2 conversion to C 2+ products such as ethanol with high selectivity by electroreduction, while investigating the mechanisms is even difficult. Herein, the enhanced ethanol selectivity on the sulfurized Au core Ag shell nanoparticles (Au@Ag‐S NPs) for CO 2 electroreduction by operando electrochemical surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC‐SERS) is investigated. A high ethanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60% is achieved at a high potential of −0.75 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) on Au@Ag‐S NPs for CO 2 electroreduction. The electron transfer from Au core to Ag shell at the Au@Ag‐S NPs interface is proved by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which facilitates the CO 2 electroreduction to ethanol. Operando EC‐SERS provides convincing spectral evidence of the *CO intermediates adsorbed and interface water at the surface of Au@Ag‐S NPs, which facilitates subsequent CO‐CO coupling and the formation of ethanol. Density functional theory (DFT) found that ethanol production at the Au@Ag‐S interface is facilitated by the reduced energy barrier of CO‐CO coupling following the sulfurization of Au@Ag NPs.

Machine learning models, particularly XGBoost and random forest, achieve high predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error by over 50% compared to structural‐only models.

For downstream processing after the biosorption of Au from the PCB leachates, the yeast cells are used as the starting material for synthesizing Au NPs, which are a high‐value‐added product of waste PCBs. Two different chemical approaches are developed for the reductive synthesis of Au NPs from the yeast cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract The efficient production of fuels and chemical products from lignocellulosic biomass derivatives is a key objective in biorefinery research. Levulinic acid (LA), a valuable building block derived from lignocellulosic materials, serves as a precursor for alkyl levulinates via esterification with bio‐alcohols. These esters are widely used in industry as fuel additives, solvents, and fragrances. In this work, a microwave‐assisted one‐pot protocol is presented for the valorization of post‐harvest vegetable residues, specifically tomato, spinach, pepper, broccoli, red cabbage, beet, and artichoke, which are treated independently. The optimized reaction conditions for alkyl levulinate production, determined using the one‐variable‐at‐a‐time method, are as follows: 170 °C, 30 min, 150 mg of H 3 PWO 40 (HPA), 2 mL of co‐solvent, and 2 mL of alcohol based on 0.3 g of biomass. Under these conditions, complete substrate conversion is achieved, with alkyl levulinate yields ranging from 25% to 55%. Green metrics are employed to evaluate the sustainability of the process, demonstrating its alignment with green chemistry principles. The one‐pot approach reduces intermediate separation steps, minimizing waste. These findings contribute to the development of more sustainable biomass‐to‐chemical conversion pathways, reinforcing the potential of alkyl levulinates as bio‐based platform chemicals and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Upcycling strategies for polyolefins remain a significant challenge due to their chemical inertness and complex degradation pathways. A solvent‐free, mechanochemical approach is reported to introduce conjugated polyene sequences into polyethylene (PE) via a twin‐screw extrusion process. The controlled iodination/elimination strategy enables the stereoselective formation of cis‐transoid polyenes, a configuration typically achieved under cryogenic conditions but here accessible at high temperatures (106 °C) in a melt‐processing environment. This novel approach is confirmed through spectroscopic characterization, including ATR‐FTIR, Raman, and CP‐MAS 13 C NMR, and a Diels–Alder reaction that verified the stereochemistry of the resulting polyene. The polymer shows remarkable oxidative stability, with no degradation observed even after six months under ambient conditions. The unsaturated fragments within the polymer exhibit distinct reactivity, allowing selective post‐functionalization via epoxidation under reactive extrusion conditions. Mechanochemical epoxidation with m ‐chloroperoxybenzoic acid ( m CPBA) improves solubility and processability without chain fragmentation, as evidenced by SEC analysis. This work presents a scalable route for the selective functionalization of polyolefins, opening new avenues for their valorization into advanced materials and demonstrating the feasibility of high‐temperature processing for the formation of conjugated polyenes.",

However, current research still faces challenges such as complex synthesis methods, poor controllability of amorphization, and structural stability. In this work, amorphous transition metal oxalates nickel oxalate dihydrate (NiC 2 O 4 ·2H 2 O) nanoparticles are synthesized via a one‐pot method with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO 2 ). Notably, for the first time, it is found that the sample prepared at 20 MPa (SC‐20) not only demonstrates exceptional oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity under alkaline conditions, achieving an overpotential of only 299 mV at a current density of 20 mA·cm −2 , but also exhibits superior urea oxidation reaction performance, achieving a low potential of 1.346 V at 10 mA cm −2 . The outstanding catalytic performance in two typical catalysis reactions originates from the typical amorphous structure led by SC CO 2 , which facilitates the formation and stabilization of Ni 3+ active sites coupled with accelerated Ni 2+ oxidation kinetics. Therefore this work not only expands the application of SC CO 2 in the synthesis of amorphous materials but also provides novel insights for designing high‐performance amorphous catalytic materials, precisely realizing “killing two birds with one stone.”",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rice husks, a significant byproduct of rice cultivation, constitute ≈20% of the total production weight. Their management is often inadequate, with unsustainable practices such as uncontrolled burning generating severe environmental impacts. This study conducts a life‐cycle analysis (LCA) to evaluate biochar production, its use as a nutrient adsorbent in water treatment, and subsequent land application as a rice husk treatment system, comparing it with the alternative system of direct incineration for energy generation. The assessment utilizes OpenLCA 2.2.0, which integrates laboratory data and open‐access databases, along with the IMPACT2002+ method, to evaluate environmental impacts. The results indicate that the biomass preparation process generates the most significant environmental burdens due to its intensive energy consumption and the use of reagents. In contrast, land application generates net benefits in some of the evaluated categories, highlighting its potential as a carbon sink and sustainable alternative for agriculture. Sensitivity analysis of variations in energy source, MgCl₂ concentration, and applied biochar dose reveals that wind energy is the most favorable option. High MgCl₂ concentrations increased the impacts, and varying the biochar dose applied to the soil does not generate significant changes in most of the impact categories evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Improving the efficiency of well‐known photocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction is contingent upon the development of cost‐effective and highly efficient co‐catalysts. The rapid recombination of photogenerated charges within semiconductor materials, such as SrTiO 3 (STO), results in reduced photocatalytic efficiency. To address this, copper‐based co‐catalysts have garnered considerable attention due to their relative low‐cost, natural abundance of constituents, and promising reactivity. In this work, p‐Cu(OH) 2 /n‐SrTiO 3 heterojunctions are prepared for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. The SrTiO 3 photocatalysts with a flower‐like morphology decorated with Cu(OH) 2 at different weight percentages of Cu (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 wt.%) are successfully prepared using a simple solvothermal and photodeposition process. The p‐Cu(OΗ) 2 /n‐SrTiO 3 composite with 1 wt.% Cu content exhibits significant enhancement toward photocatalytic hydrogen production compared to the pristine STO, achieving a rate of ∼139 µmol h −1 (∼6950 µmol g −1 h −1 mass activity) under λ &gt; 360 nm light irradiation which is ≈3.5 times higher than that of single‐component STO. X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies indicate formation of Cu(OH) 2 phase. Moreover, UV–vis/NIR, EIS spectroscopy, and photocatalytic evaluation studies indicate that the improved photocatalytic performance arises from the formation of p‐n junction at the Cu(OH) 2 /STO interface that promotes enhanced charge carrier transfer and separation within the heterojunctions.",

However, existing hydrometallurgical strategies typically consume huge amounts of corrosive leachate without reusability, especially for recycling materials with multiple types of metallic elements. Herein, the successful realization of the reusability of Rosa roxburghii type biomass leachate is reported during recycling the wasted LI cathode. The key to realizing leachate reusability relies on the co‐precipitation of multiple transition metal elements based on coordination chemistry, which is different from the conventional method where alkali is necessary to neutralize the leachate for precipitating the metallic elements. It is demonstrated that the complete leaching of wasted NCM cathode at room temperature (25 °C) for 1 h, with an activation energy E a = 70.30 kJ mol −1 . Highly efficient recovery is achieved by co‐precipitation using anhydrous oxalic acid (OA) (with efficiencies of 97.21%, 98.78%, and 96.55%, for Ni, Co, and Mn, respectively) without neutralizing the leachate, thus enabling leachate reusability. The structure and electrochemical properties of the regenerated NCM cathode (R‐NCM111) are comparable to those of the commercialized samples. This work is expected to provide a general strategy for achieving the reusability of biomass leachate for the recovery of wasted NCM cathode.",

E‐waste causes severe environmental damage, such as the pollution of soil, water, and air. Therefore, there is an urge for effective e‐waste management, recycling, and sustainable consumption. In this report, We developed high‐performance triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) utilizing discarded laptop LCD screens as triboelectric layers for energy harvesting and organic dye pollutant degradation. Among all the fabricated devices, the LCDW4‐TENG exhibited exceptional performance with fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) as the opposite frictional layer, yielding a V oc of ≈470 V, I sc of ≈ 143 µA, and a power density of 5.04 W m − 2 at a load resistance of 1 MΩ. The long‐term stability of the device is tested over 6,000 cycles and is found to be very stable. This e‐waste‐based TENG is employed in the treatment of methylene blue organic dye through TENG‐assisted photocatalysis. An enhanced degradation efficiency of methylene blue dye is observed with the support of TENG.

The study focuses on the first five galvanostatic cycles to capture the critical early‐stage SEI consolidation process, essential for understanding the interfacial phenomena that dictate long‐term performance. By employing innovative electrode fabrication techniques such as plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition and utilizing ionic liquid (IL)‐based electrolytes—specifically 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (EMIFSI) formulations known for their low viscosity and high conductivity—this work addresses the challenges posed by the significant volume changes inherent to Si‐based materials.

The findings demonstrate clear material‐ and electrolyte‐dependent differences in SEI characteristics, thereby establishing new avenues for optimizing interfacial stability and battery performance.

Here, a sustainable upcycling strategy is presented that transforms discarded biaxially‐oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films into high‐performance anisotropic conductive polymer composites through a low‐temperature alternating lamination approach. By harnessing the intrinsic molecular orientation of BOPP and the chemical compatibility with polypropylene random copolymer (PPR), alternating BOPP insulating layer and PPR conductive layers containing conductive fillers are thermally welded at an optimized temperature of 160 °C, enabling strong interfacial bonding while preserving the orientation‐induced mechanical advantages. This innovative processing method yields a remarkable 162% improvement in tensile strength and an extraordinary 1193% enhancement in toughness compared to conventional recycled technology. More importantly, the resulting composites exhibit outstanding electrical anisotropy, characterized by an in‐plane conductivity of 11.4 S m −1 while maintaining excellent through‐thickness insulation. Such a unique integration of mechanical robustness and directional conductivity enables promising applications in next‐generation intelligent electronics.

    "abstract": "Abstract Perovskite colloidal nanocrystals (PeNCs) exhibit outstanding optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). Despite the remarkable performance improvements in perovskite‐based LEDs (PeLEDs) over the years, a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA), covering their synthesis and purification, operation, and end‐of‐life disposal, remains crucial as large‐scale production and commercialization approach. This study provides an exhaustive study of environmental impacts and costs on the fabrication of CsPbBr 3 PeNCs by the conventional hot injection (HI) route and the alternative microwave‐assisted (MW) approach. Morphological, structural, and optical characterization confirms the high quality of both sets of NCs, although minor differences are detected. The MW route significantly reduces impacts at the laboratory scale due to its superior energy efficiency. However, at the industrial scale, both routes exhibit similar energy efficiencies, making the environmental comparison less conclusive. Additionally, n‐dodecane (DOD) is explored as an alternative solvent for PeNC synthesis, with its recovery via distillation successfully demonstrated. While DOD recovery reduces solvent consumption, the lower reaction yield results in a higher overall environmental impact. The MW ODE method currently offers the lowest total costs, primarily due to reduced labor expenses. Advancing the MW method with DOD to achieve yields comparable to HI could represent a breakthrough for sustainable PeNCs synthesis.",

Replacing the widely used solvent, N ‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone (NMP), with water poses challenges, particularly due to rapid pH increases during processing. This leads to aluminum corrosion and reduced performance. This study investigates the stability and performance of spinel LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LNMO) electrodes processed with water‐based polyacrylate binders across a pH range. By partly neutralization with sodium or lithium, respectively, the pH is tuned from 5 to 8. The binders are assessed for their ability to stabilize slurry pH during processing and their electrochemical performance. Full cell cycling identifies pH5 as optimal condition for achieving on‐par performance and excellent cycling stability. Compared, electrodes processed at higher pH exhibit significantly reduced electrochemical performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that higher slurry pH correlates with increased charge transfer resistance, while surface analyses using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy indicate increased conductive carbon and binder agglomeration at higher pH, leading to an inhomogeneous electrode. Operando X‐ray diffraction confirms that poor conductive carbon/binder distribution in the cathodes processed at higher pH prevents complete (de)lithiation, while electrodes processed at pH5 demonstrate a uniform conductive network, resulting in superior performance comparable to conventionally processed counterparts.",

BET surface area and Horvath‐Kawazoe (HK) pore volume analyses show that nanofiber PANI has a higher surface area (35.3 m 2 g −1 ) and pore volume (0.1391 cm 3 g −1 ) compared to CBTS (2.2 m 2 g −1 and 0.0107 cm 3 g −1 ). Adding CBTS to PANI reduces these values, with composites ranging from 22.82 to 24.35 m 2 g −1 and 0.1654 to 0.1845 cm 3 g −1 , respectively. HRTEM reveals evenly dispersed PANI nanofibers (40–60 nm diameter, several micrometers long), with CBTS crystalline regions (12–26 nm) on PANI/CBTS5, enhancing electrical conductivity. XPS confirms CBTS doping and significant electronic interactions between PANI and CBTS, detailing the chemical states of Cu, Ba, Sn, and S. Electrochemical tests over 10000 cycles demonstrate that PANI/CBTS composites outperform pure PANI, with PANI/CBTS5 achieving a specific capacitance of 374.2 F g −1 and an energy density of 5.20 Wh kg −1 . Higher CBTS concentrations slightly lower the specific capacitance.

The elemental composition of carbon dots, more specifically, the non‐carbon elements forming functional groups, has crucial roles in determining the structure and properties, opening a wide scope for tailoring through compositional engineering. In this work, tuned carbon dots derived from waste Cassava peel, synthesized by applying solvent engineering strategy in facile single‐step microwave‐assisted solvothermal treatment, are reported. The proportion of charge accumulation mechanisms is found to be highly dependent on the elemental composition of oxygen and nitrogen in the carbon dots, evidencing the pivotal role of functional groups. Among the carbon dots synthesized using three different solvents. Ethylenediamine based ones show highest energy storage capability (114.57 F g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 ) owing to nitrogen‐oxygen co‐functionalization. Though these carbon dots have low storage capabilities as such, they have potential prospects to be incorporated into electrode materials to tune charge storage mechanisms desirably, often with the added advantage of enhanced stability and performance. Additionally, the redox properties exhibited by the tuned samples give promising prospects toward applications like electrochemical sensing and electrolyte engineering for energy storage.",

However, their constrained energy density limits practical deployment in long‐duration energy storage systems. To overcome this challenge, iron oxide quantum dots (FeO x QDs) are strategically employed to leverage their pronounced quantum size effects, which enhance charge transfer kinetics and create abundant electrochemically active sites. Meanwhile, utilizing the natural hierarchical porosity and oxygen‐rich functional groups of biomass‐derived carbon materials can offer a sustainable platform. In this study, the FeO x QDs with silk fibroin (SF) composites are prepared as electrode materials for SCs. The combination of FeO x QDs/SF offers a strategic approach to exploiting unique properties of components synergistically. The relatively low electrical conductivity of biomass carbon is modified by the quantum size effect of FeO x QDs, while the biomass carbon material provides a stable scaffold for the QDs, effectively inhibiting their agglomeration. Finally, the assembled pouch FeO x QDs/SF//FeO x QDs/SF symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) can reach an energy density of 45.13 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 1.07 kW kg −1 . In addition, its specific capacitance retention rate is 85.19% after 10000 cycles, indicating its great potential in high‐performance supercapacitor applications.",

Structural defects, including vacancies, stacking faults, grain boundaries and voids emerged from the interplay between calcium doping and microwave irradiation. The 10 mol.% Ca:TiO 2 membrane achieves an 81% degradation rate and an adsorption capacity of ≈25.8 mg g −1 , showcasing excellent photocatalytic and adsorption performance. The enhanced performance is attributed to the high surface area of Ca:TiO 2 agglomerates, the presence of oxygen vacancies, structural defects and the abundance of surface hydroxyl groups. X‐ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the Fermi level of the 10 mol.% Ca:TiO 2 nanomaterial is positioned near the conduction band edge, indicating a significant modification of its electronic properties, with high electrical conductivity at room temperature (RT). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations provided a deeper insight into the impact of calcium doping, revealing that calcium (Ca) incorporation promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies, introducing additional electronic states near the bottom of the conduction band, thereby enhancing the material's electrical conductivity.

Traditional methods for removing antibiotics from water bodies are often limited by low efficiency and high energy consumption. Leveraging the distinct structural and functional properties of both wood and plant polyphenols, composite materials for water treatment can be developed through their synergistic integration. This approach not only provides a versatile substrate but also enhances interfacial functionalization via metal‐polyphenolic mediated self‐assembly of nanomaterials. Here, the nanomaterials (TiO 2 and Fe 3 O 4 ) are encapsulated onto the surface of wood sawdust to fabricate a functionalized, wood‐based composite material (FeTi‐bioCap) for high‐efficiency antibiotic flowthrough removal. FeTi‐bioCap presents an excellent adsorption performance for ciprofloxacin (186.21 mg g −1 ), meanwhile demonstrating efficient removal. As the size of the separation column increases, the contact time between the adsorption sites on FeTi‐bioCap and the antibiotic increases, thereby significantly enhancing the removal efficiency of the antibiotic. This provides the possibility of extending FeTi‐bioCap to economic efficiency, stable/reliable, and scale‐up industrial integration. Importantly, this strategy not only efficiently removes antibiotics from flowing water but also is conducive to the high‐value utilization of biomass resources.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Efficient capture of the gaseous radioiodine is significantly pivotal for the sustainable development of nuclear energy and the long‐term radiation safety of the ecological system. Recently, various adsorbents with delicate nanostructures have been designed and investigated for capturing the volatile radioactive iodine, however, these powdery adsorbents, for instance, silver/copper/bismuth/tin based nanomaterials, metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent‐organic frameworks (COFs), ect are facing significant processing issuesand difficulties in handling and transportation. Inspired by the success of the neutron shielding materials of lead (Pb) containing PE (polyethylene) (Pb‐PE), herein, the encapsulation of a series of efficient powdery adsorbents is conducted into the skeleton of the recycled PS (polystyrene) foam. The results show that these powdery materials are well compatible with the porous skeleton of the prepared PS foam, consequently resulting in their uniform dispersion throughout the whole matrix. Benefitted from the highly active and uniform dispersion of these powdery materials, the composite foams deliver decent adsorption capacities within a shorter adsorption process compared with the relevant powdery materials in the static I 2 vapor capture experiment. Mechanistic studies reveal that the radioactively and chemically stable PS foam primarily acts as an inactive scaffold to disperse the active components and facilitate I 2 vapor diffusion, whereas the embedded powdery materials dominate the adsorption process. Additionally, a semi‐automated preparation platform is set to achieve the scalable fabrication of efficient composite foams to demonstrate the commercial prospects of the strategy. Moreover, an adsorption efficiency of ~99.95 ± 0.03% is realized for the radioactive I 2 vapor under the N 2 flow rate of 0.1 L min −1 in the dynamic adsorption process at 70 °C using the prepared SnS‐400/foam. This work presents a facile and efficient strategy for fabricating high‐performance adsorbents for radioactive iodine vapor using recycled polystyrene (PS) plastics. This approach not only addresses the critical need for effective iodine capture but also opens promising avenues for the sustainable repurposing of plastic wastes.",

The system utilizes exhaust gas kinetic energy to drive a turbine connected to a high‐speed compressor motor via the main shaft. By dynamically adjusting the nozzle opening degree (NOD), the turbine optimizes exhaust flow area and backpressure, maximizing energy recovery power across operating conditions. Simultaneously, regulating the oxygen excess ratio (OER) ensures optimal cathode oxygen supply for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). A control‐oriented model capturing VNT‐based air compressor and PEMFC coupling dynamics is developed and validated. Multi‐start sequential quadratic programming identifies optimal OER trajectories that minimize compressor motor power while maintaining electrochemical performance. To track the target, a linear parameter variation adaptive model predictive control is implemented. Relationships between NOD, OER, and PEMFC power characteristics are embedded in a control‐oriented model validated through map testing. The proposed strategy demonstrates superior OER tracking under dynamic loads like the China Heavy‐duty Truck Cycle.

In this study, a germanium (Ge) substitution strategy is employed to enhance the energy storage performance of niobium silicide electrodes. Ge is incorporated at varying concentrations, and its effects on microstructural and electrochemical properties are investigated in both as‐cast and annealed samples. Microstructural analysis reveals predominant formation of the Nb(Si,Ge) 2 phase, with a minor Nb 5 (Si,Ge) 3 phase (&lt;5%), indicating high intermetallic phase stability in the ternary alloy system.

Interestingly, the as‐cast Nb(Si 9 Ge 1 ) 2 , with a minor Ge substitution, displays an unexpected increase in both specific capacitance and cyclic stability compared to NbSi 2 . The enhanced performance is attributed to the high electrical conductivity of Ge, which facilitates efficient ion transport.

However, the development of anode‐free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) is largely hindered by the uncontrolled sodium deposition behavior, resulting in poor cycling stability and low coulombic efficiency. This review summarizes the state‐of‐art progress of AFSMBs with a focus on anode interfacial engineering and electrolyte optimization strategies for mitigating sodium loss during cycling. Links between adverse sodium deposition behavior at interfaces and the performance degradation of AFSMBs are established to decode their failure mechanisms. The essential role of controlled sodium nucleation and stable SEI formation in enabling uniform sodium deposition is also intensively discussed. Recent advances in interfacial engineering and electrolyte design are presented, including 3D current collector architectures and the development of solid‐state electrolytes. Furthermore, the critical importance of in situ characterization techniques for probing fundamental mechanisms is specially accounted.

    "abstract": "Abstract Approximately one‐third of the food produced globally is not consumed; meanwhile, world hunger is still a rising issue. This puzzling situation is mainly attributed to the postharvest spoilage of fruits and vegetables, and transpiration plays an important role in this process. The use of plastic film packaging is an effective and convenient means to prevent transpiration. However, the overuse of plastics has resulted in serious environmental pollution and a microplastic crisis. In this study, edible bioplastic films based on soybean protein isolate (SPI), carrageenan (CA), glycerol and beeswax (BW) are successfully developed, and these films are comparable to polyethylene (PE) plastic films in terms of preventing the evaporation of water and the degradation of bioactive components in leafy vegetables and fruits. The addition of BW is found to weaken the intermolecular interactions between the protein and polysaccharides, leading to a more homogeneous microstructure. The presence of fatty alcohols and alkanes in BW significantly improves the hydrophobic properties of the edible films, facilitating both low water vapor permeability and solubility.",

The Rh nanoparticles exhibited a size effect for the MOR, and the one with the average size of ≈2.83 nm showed exceptional mass activity of 609 mA mg −1 due to the fast electronic transfer and efficient active surface area, far surpassing most of the reported Rh‐based catalysts.

    "abstract": "Abstract The regeneration performance of ZnFe 2 O 4 in wastewater treatment is highly dependent on its degree of inversion. This study systematically investigates the relationship between inversion degree and photocatalytic efficiency of ZFO MNPs for degrading industrial pollutants under solar irradiation. ZFO nanoparticles are synthesized via co‐precipitation and subjected to thermal annealing at temperatures ranging from 550 to 950 °C to control their structural properties. Comprehensive characterization revealed that increasing annealing temperature progressively reduced the inversion degree from 0.54 to zero, as determined by Rietveld refinement of X‐ray diffraction data. This corresponds to a structural transition from intermediate mixed spinel to normal spinel configuration, driven by thermally‐induced iron cation migration within the crystal lattice. The structural evolution directly influenced the electronic properties, causing bandgap redshift and modifying photogenerated electron‐hole pair recombination dynamics, as confirmed through Mott‐Schottky analysis and photocurrent measurements. The inversion degree, along with crystallite size and spin disorder, significantly affected the saturation magnetization of ZFO samples. The molecular simulations revealed that the electrostatic interactions dominate the adsorption of methylene blue (MB) onto ZFO. Photocatalytic experiments demonstrated that the intermediate spinel structure (annealed at 550 °C, x = 0.54) exhibited optimal performance, achieving 97% MB degradation within 70 min under solar irradiation. This enhanced activity is attributed to improved charge separation efficiency and reduced electron‐hole recombination in the inverted spinel structure.",

However, the performance is often constrained by conventional electrolytes. Moreover, the low electrical conductivity and limited transparency of electrodes, which typically function within a single band only, remain a bottleneck due to these material limitations. This study focuses on developing a visible and NIR dual‐band electrochromic supercapacitor using a novel MXene/WO 3 ·H 2 O hybrid electrode, fabricated via a simple solution‐based method and using an aluminium ion‐based multivalent aqueous electrolyte. The incorporation of 2D MXene into the electrochromic 2D‐like WO 3 ·H 2 O matrix enhances charge transport kinetics, while multivalent cations further boost performance by enabling multiple electrons transfer redox reactions. Owing to these synergistic effects, the electrode exhibits outstanding electrochromic properties, including fast switching (≈3 s) and high optical modulation (≈51% visible, ≈82% NIR), indicating excellent solar thermal regulation, along with high stability and energy storage performance (60 mF cm −2 ). This work demonstrates the cost‐effective fabrication of multifunctional electrochromic energy storage devices that offer promising prospects for sustainable smart window technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In conventional cement production, carbonate decomposition represents the dominant contributor to CO 2 emissions. Introducing green hydrogen into the calciner facilitates the reduction of limestone to CaO and CO, achieving in situ CO 2 utilization while decreasing the calcination temperature, thereby resulting in mitigation of carbon emissions and energy demands. Nevertheless, this approach is limited by hydrogenation conversion efficiency of limestone. This study proposes an innovative red mud doping strategy, in which cost‐effective red mud‐doped limestone composites are prepared by ball milling and evaluated for hydrogenation performance in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the catalytic mechanism of Fe 4 cluster during CaCO 3 hydrogenation. Results show that at 650 °C under 100% H 2 , a red mud/limestone mass ratio of 2:20 enhances CO selectivity by 11.83% compared to natural limestone. The hydrogenation process follows a dynamic catalytic pathway, beginning with reduced Fe species as the primary active sites, which subsequently transition to calcined CaO‐dominated catalysis. DFT analysis confirms that Fe active sites significantly enhance the interaction between H 2 and CaCO 3 surface, reducing the H 2 dissociation barrier by 94.8% and altering the rate‐limiting step. This work provides a promising approach for low‐carbon cement production while simultaneously advancing sustainable red mud utilization.",

The Ag‐coated PAI membranes exhibit high electrical conductivity (exceeding 5.6 × 10 4 S cm −1 ), enabling the use of an applied electric potential to enhance dye removal efficiency and mitigate membrane fouling via electrochemical mechanisms. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test confirm the high conductivity of the membranes. Meanwhile, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) revealed the presence of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the membrane surface. These findings provide valuable insights into the electrochemical potential for fabricating electro‐conductive membranes (ECMs). The Ag‐PAI membranes demonstrate remarkable dye rejection, with rates reaching 97% for reactive red 120 (RR120) and 90% for reactive black (RB) at an applied voltage of 7 V, while maintaining a consistent permeate flux of ≈100 LMH. The membranes also show significantly improved resistance to organic fouling, with the flux recovery ratio (FRR) increasing from 49.14% for pristine PAI to 80.41%, representing a 31% enhancement. The enhanced antifouling performance is attributed to gas bubble formation during voltage application, which disrupted the accumulation of the fouling cake layer.

Integrated CO 2 electrolysis is a possibility to reduce operating costs by combining desorption and electrolysis. In this approach, it is important to provide sufficient CO 2 directly from the absorbent solution to the catalyst, whereby the physically absorbed CO 2 appears to play a central role. Therefore, the absorbent solution used for integrated electrolysis must meet a wide range of requirements, as it needs to supply sufficient CO 2 while being compatible with the process conditions in the cell. In this study, it is demonstrated that KOH and piperazine (PZ) are suitable absorbent solutions for integrated CO 2 electrolysis among the three tested groups of absorbents – namely, inorganic, amines, and physical absorbents. The results reveal that physical absorbents provide the highest amount of accessible CO 2 for electrolysis, whereas inorganic absorbents exhibit the highest compatibility with the membranes. KOH and PZ demonstrate the ability to withstand the electrochemical conditions during CO 2 electrolysis and the capability to produce C 2+ products during integrated CO 2 electrolysis.

However, the use of metal catalysts in electrolyzer designs is challenging due to their high cost, catalyst dissolution, and susceptibility to poisoning. Conductive polymers have emerged as a promising new class of metal‐free catalysts for ORR, combining electron conductivity and a lack of an insulating oxidation layer. In this study, a new n‐type polymer is explored, poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), as an ORR catalyst to enhance deoxygenation efficiency in carbon‐based electrolyzers. Electrocatalytic studies show that BBL film improves ORR kinetics via a four‐electron pathway with a mass activity of the order of 100 A g −1 . A low‐voltage electrolyzer is constructed and tested using BBL‐coated carbon fiber paper (CFP) as the cathode for ORR and CFP as the anode to drive the oxidation of catechol as a compensating faradaic reaction to facilitate ORR. The deoxygenation electrolyzer with a drop‐cast BBL cathode achieves fast deoxygenation kinetics, reaching below 0.1 mg L −1 DO in salty solution with 0.001 m catechol. The findings introduce a new approach to deoxygenating thermal fluids by employing an ORR polymer catalyst and a compensating redox additive (RA) in water.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) offers a promising solution to address the global energy crisis. However, excessive heating remains a major issue for photovoltaic, resulting in a reduced solar‐to‐electricity conversion efficiency and waste heat discharge. Here, an energy‐efficient and self‐sustained concentrating photovoltaic thermal (CPVT) system is presented by utilizing a superwicking metal (SWIM) heat‐mass exchanger that simultaneously converts solar energy for electricity, steam generation, and heat storage. The system achieves high integration by directly attaching the SWIM plate to the backside of a CPV cell. The SWIM surface pulls a thin film of water uphill across its surface, effectively extracting waste heat from the CPV panel through interfacial evaporative heat transfer and repurposing it for steam generation and thermal storage. SWIM shows a large cooling capacity through a combined radiative, conductive, and evaporative cooling processes. Under 100x solar concentration, SWIM reduces the CPV temperature from 98.12 to 69.73 °C, boosting the electricity generation by 19.76%. Additionally, the developed SWIM‐CPV system can track the sun throughout the day to maximize solar radiance and energy harvesting performance. An average solar energy harvesting efficiency over 80% is demonstrated for concentration ratios from 10x to 100x, surpassing most comparable technologies.",

To address the power supply challenges for wireless monitoring sensors, in this work, a hybrid triboelectric‐electromagnetic‐piezoelectric energy harvester is leveraged, leveraging synergistic transduction mechanisms, enabling simultaneous harvesting of alternating magnetic field energy around conductors and ambient wind energy. It is shown that under operational conditions of 1000 rpm rotation speed and 15 A line current, the maximum load power outputs reach 490.05 µW (triboelectric), 24.89 mW (electromagnetic), and 0.23 mW (piezoelectric), respectively. In addition, the outputs of the three power generation modules of the composite energy harvester are synergistically managed in conjunction with the LTC3588 energy management circuit. This enables a 100 µF capacitor to be charged to 11.8 V in 4 s and continuously drive the wireless temperature sensor.

Characterization results revealed that GLU favored PEI incorporation, whereas pre‐oxidation limited PEI binding.

Adsorption kinetics are best described by the pseudo‐second‐order model, while equilibrium data are best fitted by the Sips isotherm. The highest DB86 adsorption capacity (225.9 mg g − 1 ) is achieved with oxidized BPC functionalized with PEI, due to its higher zeta potential and lower surface density of macromolecules, which facilitate improved dye diffusion. Density Functional Theory calculations revealed that primary and secondary amines constitute the main interaction sites for DB86.

    "abstract": "Abstract Amidst global advocacy for green development, bamboo has emerged as a promising renewable alternative to plastics and conventional timber due to its rapid growth, sustainability, and eco‐friendly attributes. However, inherent limitations—including poor flame retardancy, inadequate hydrophobicity, susceptibility to insect/microbial infestation, fiber degradation, compromised mechanical properties, and reduced service life—constrain its broad applications. Recent advancements through integrated physical–chemical modification approaches (e.g., thermal treatment, compression, alkaline processing, and graft polymerization) have substantially enhanced bamboo's performance. This review systematically synthesizes research on bamboo functionalization from 2016 to 2025. Within theoretical frameworks of materials chemistry and interface science, three predominant modification strategies—flame retardancy, hydrophobicity, and antimicrobial efficacy— are comparatively analyzed elucidating their mechanistic principles and performance correlations. Critical findings highlight that multiscale collaborative modifications (e.g., bioenzyme‐nanofiller‐hydrogel synergies) and green modifying agents (e.g., rosin, tannic acid) represent key breakthroughs to overcome current technical bottlenecks. These innovations not only expand bamboo's applicability in harsh environments but also establish novel paradigms for functionalized biomass material design, offering significant ecological and economic benefits in alignment with carbon neutrality goals.",

This unique morphology facilitates a highly active in situ reconstructed interface, delivering a current density of 134 mA cm −2 at 1.40 V (vs RHE) in 1 m KOH with 0.33 m urea, significantly outperforming its individual components.

Nonetheless, their practical application is hindered by the intrinsic kinetic limitations of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at air cathodes, which degrade charge–discharge efficiency and cycling stability. Biomass‐derived carbon materials, characterized by their structural versatility, cost‐effectiveness, and sustainability, present a compelling solution for catalyzing these oxygen‐based reactions. This review systematically examines rational design strategies for enhancing the catalytic performance of biomass‐derived carbon materials.

Recent advancements in tailoring biomass precursors and pyrolysis protocols are critically analyzed to establish structure–activity correlations. This work identifies key challenges to long‐term stability by studying the degradation mechanisms and proposes scalable synthesis methods for the precise control of multiscale structures.

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID‐19 pandemic sharply increased medical waste, intensifying concerns about sustainability in healthcare. This paper evaluates biodegradable polymers—polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and chitosan—as substitutes for conventional plastics. PLA is effective for disposable products and sutures, PCL shows potential for implantables, and chitosan offers both antibacterial and degradable properties. While these materials provide clear advantages at end‐of‐life stages, upstream production remains energy‐intensive and costly: PLA and chitosan may be 80–100% more expensive than conventional plastics, while PCL can approach cost parity in certain applications. Lifecycle assessments highlight pretreatment and fermentation as the main contributors to environmental burdens. Adoption is further challenged by scalability, durability in medical contexts, strict regulatory requirements, and uneven waste‐management infrastructure between high‐ and low‐income countries. Substitution alone is therefore inadequate. Rebound effects—greater material use encouraged by perceptions of “green” safety—risk undermining gains unless carefully governed. We argue for an integrated transition combining material innovation with lifecycle governance, procurement standards, targeted fiscal incentives, and equitable investment in recycling infrastructure. Priorities include harmonized testing, supply chain transparency, and support for low‐ and middle‐income regions. With these measures, biodegradable materials could substantially reduce the healthcare sector’s plastic footprint while safeguarding safety, affordability, and global equity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The accelerating accumulation of plastic waste highlights the urgent need for recycling strategies aligned with sustainable development. Converting plastics into carbonaceous feedstocks offers a promising pathway to close the carbon loop while reducing reliance on virgin fossil resources. Conventional recycling methods remain constrained by high energy input, limited compatibility with mixed waste streams, and undesirable by‐products. Emerging green catalytic approaches aim to address these limitations, enabling plastic upcycling under milder conditions and reducing dependence on hazardous solvents and energy‐intensive processes. In particular, the synergistic catalytic systems integrating thermal, photo, electricity, and biological catalysis demonstrate unique advantages over single‐mode strategies by combining complementary reaction pathways, lowering activation barriers, enhancing selectivity, and improving energy utilization. Such synergistic effects not only broaden the scope of processable plastic substrates but also contribute to value‐added products and reduce costs. In this review, we highlight the significant potential of synergistic strategies in advancing plastic valorization, while also discussing challenges in catalyst durability, process scalability, and substrate heterogeneity. It is hoped that this review could encourage innovations in rational catalyst design, synergistic process construction, and complementary multi‐system combination to establish economically and environmentally robust platforms for plastic valorization.",

In this work, the bifunctionality of VO 2 (B) is investigated in overall water electrolysis, focusing on its enhanced catalytic activity when doped with transition metal atoms such as tungsten (W). Hydrothermally synthesized W‐doped VO 2 (B) nanoflakes demonstrate superior hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), confirming this enhanced catalytic activity.

    "abstract": "Abstract The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction to methanol (CH 3 OH) suggests an attractive approach toward carbon neutrality, while the activity and selectivity of CO 2 ‐to‐CH 3 OH are substantially low compared to most of the other C 1 products like CH 4 , largely due to the much less preferred thermodynamic CH 3 OH formation pathway and the limited capability of controlling the adsorption of key intermediates toward CH 3 OH. Herein, a machine learning approach with first‐principles calculations is demonstrated to identify key descriptors that govern the protonation of * CO intermediates and prevent C─C coupling, which are critical factors in determining product selectivity toward the CH 3 OH formation. Datasets linking the intrinsic structural properties of heteroatom‐doped Cu catalysts to their catalytic performances are developed, among which the Bader charge, bond length, and d ‐band center are determined to be the key descriptors. The electronic structure analysis reveals that RhCu alloys demonstrate both enhanced selectivity and catalytic activity for the CO 2 ‐to‐CH 3 OH synthesis, with the d ‐band center shifting toward the Fermi level by 0.18 eV. This shift mitigates the competing hydrogen evolution reaction and simultaneously enhances the adsorption of key intermediates ( * CHO and * CO). This work presents a cost‐effective data‐driven approach for designing high‐performance Cu‐based catalysts toward selective CO 2 ‐to‐CH 3 OH electrosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aqueous zinc–iodine (Zn–I 2 ) batteries are considered a promising sustainable energy storage system due to their high energy density, cost‐effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, polyiodide shuttling leads to severe capacity loss and poor cycle stability. Herein, FeCoNiCrMn high‐entropy alloy (HEA) nanocatalysts are introduced, leveraging their inherent multi‐elemental synergy and abundant active sites for both exceptional polyiodide adsorption and accelerated redox kinetics. As a result, the Zn–I 2 batteries with HEA nanocatalysts deliver a remarkable specific capacity of 220.23 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1 (≈100% iodine utilization) and exhibit minimal capacity decay (0.0014% per cycle) over 25 000 cycles at 5 A g −1 . Furthermore, Zn–I 2 pouch cells (5×5 cm 2 , 7.5 mg cm −2 iodine loading) with HEA catalysts enable high capacity retention (17.0 mAh after 2000 cycles at 4 mA cm −2 ). This work demonstrates the high‐entropy catalysis as a powerful strategy for designing high‐performance, durable Zn–I 2 batteries.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cellulose (BC) is often used as a carbon source for in situ carbonization into carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The main challenge for such CNFs lies in the low yield and very low apparent density of the product, which hamper their applications as electrode materials in batteries and fuel cells. Herein, BC pellicles (8 wt%) are simultaneously employed as a substrate and a sacrificial microreactor, thus allowing the carbonization in its unique porous network. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid serves as a carbon source and a nitrogen source, while cobalt plays the role of a recyclable pore‐creating template to create a 3D nitrogen‐doped graphite carbon with hierarchically porous structure (HPGC). The resultant HPGC exhibits a large specific surface area, high porosity, and large amount of structural defects, which translate into very high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. The synthesis route, the catalyst structure, and the proposed mechanism open novel avenue and insights to develop next‐generation metal‐free ORR catalysts.",

Here, a new class of user‐customized, on‐the‐fly power source based on an all‐hand‐drawn primary zinc (Zn)–air battery system is demonstrated. The all‐hand‐drawn Zn–air batteries are fabricated directly on A4 paper (serving as a mechanical substrate and gas diffusion layer) under ambient conditions by using a simple pen/pencil‐based hand drawing technique. The Zn–air batteries consist of pen‐drawn silver current collectors, pen‐drawn Zn anodes, pencil‐drawn carbon air cathodes, and pen‐drawn gel electrolytes. Notably, oil painting‐inspired Zn anode ink presents well‐tailored rheological properties for the pen drawing. Subsequent UV curing enables the pen‐drawn Zn anode to show dimensional stability and long‐term structural integrity. The resulting Zn–air batteries exhibit reliable electrochemical performance and on‐demand control of cell voltage/capacity. The all‐hand‐drawn Zn–air batteries are aesthetically unitized with various IoT devices including an e‐sketch of a light bulb and a smart paper lampshade as an unprecedented on‐the‐fly power source, underscoring the exceptional process simplicity, ubiquitous portability and design versatility that lie far beyond those achievable with conventional battery technologies.",

Here, the degradation behavior of three artificial cellulose polymorphs (cellulose II, III I , and III II ) in the presence of hydrogen chloride vapor is explored. While the ultimate results of hydrolyses correspond to those found for aqueous HCl, the kinetic scission models exhibit a unique trend for each polymorph, unlike those reported for aqueous acid or enzymatic hydrolyses. In addition to the polymorphic distinctions, these atypical trends are attributed to the nonequilibrium in the hydrolysis set up and the irregular adsorption of HCl molecules to the substrate surfaces. The results point to a new way of approaching the reactivity of natural polymers where polymorphism is regarded as one of the parameters for the kinetics and outcome of chemical reactions.",

Production processes have impacts on local water resources throughout their entire (often transboundary) value chain.

This paper reviews and evaluates existing approaches with the following aims: i) providing guidance for practitioners concerning the suitability of available methods and tools for different applications; ii) providing a scientifically robust criteria‐based comparison identifying the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches to stimulate future method development. Eight literature‐based criteria for a suitable method for organizations are identified: documentation and transparency, scientific soundness, environmental relevance, organizational system boundaries, broadness of application, ease of application, stakeholder's acceptance, and transformative potential, specified by a total of 22 subcriteria. Nine existing approaches for measuring water‐related impacts of organizations are evaluated accordingly. These show diverging performance. Based on the overall evaluation results, taking Water Footprint (ISO 14046) as a global information tool is recommended, in combination with the Water Stewardship approach, to link assessment results to concrete mitigation measures.",

In particular during summer seasons and in warm climates, cooling loads are mostly neutralized by conventional air‐conditioning systems. Due to often very low primary temperature, these require high energy input, cause significant noise, uncomfortably cool draughts, and vertical air temperature gradients. Here, an energy efficient planar cooling device for large area integration with building interiors is presented. The system is based on a thin glass–glass capillary element and enables indoor temperature conditioning with a very low temperature gradient. The cooling ability of the device is demonstrated on a prototype scale of ≈0.5 m 2 . Computational predictions based on the obtained results show that by implementing the present system in a 24 m 2 office room located in Central Europe with a window to floor ratio of 0.42, the specific cooling load could reach up to 80 W m −2 in summer. This corresponds to an effective indoor air temperature reduction by up to about 15 °C. In comparison to other hydronic systems, the present device provides significantly more freedom regarding design, layout, and functionality of modern buildings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Energy harvesting and thermal management are required for applications in the internet‐of‐things, autarkic sensors, or highly integrated electronic devices. Thermoelectric devices, both generators and coolers, are promising specialized technologies for localized energy harvesting and thermal management. These devices are well optimized for near‐room temperature operation at the macroscopic scale. However, the high integration density of today's most significant applications requires an increasing degree of miniaturization. Understanding the design guidelines for micro‐thermoelectric devices with realistic materials properties, and with concurring size and geometry constraints, is a challenge that has not been fully addressed up to now. Here, finite element analysis is used to understand the interplay between thermal and electrical heat fluxes in micro‐thermoelectric devices. The relevant design guidelines for metallic top and bottom contacts and thermoelectric elements, as well as an optimal packing density of the thermoelectric elements are identified. The results demonstrate that on the micrometer scale, the effects of net electrical and thermal resistances of the individual components of the devices (i.e., thermoelectric leg, top, and bottom contacts) are of comparable magnitude. This makes it necessary to apply design strategies specific to the micrometer scale, in order to geometrically optimize the device.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a sustainable biomimetic approach to create ultrahydrophobic cotton fabrics. Cotton fabrics are modified using biobased raw materials to create multiple scale roughness and low surface energy on their surfaces. Naturally occurring halloysite nanotubes (HNT) are modified by silanization and direct assembly of silica (SiO 2 ) nanospheres on the surface of HNTs. HNTs “decorated” with SiO 2 nanospheres are covalently bonded onto the surface of cotton fabrics, creating a durable multiple scale surface roughness. Surface modified cotton fabrics are further grafted with fatty acid without using any solvent, via esterification. The combination of the hierarchical roughness pattern created on the surface through modified HNT, and fatty acid treatment results in ultrahydrophobic fabrics with water contact angles (WCAs) above 150°. Surface topographies of modified HNT particles and chemical changes are fully characterized. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier‐transform infrared and WCA studies are used to confirm the grafting of modified HNT particles and aliphatic fatty chains on surface of fabrics. The ultrahydrophobic cotton fabrics washed for five standard laundry cycles (25 home washings) show that the ultrahydrophobicity is durable. Moreover, the ultrahydrophobic fabrics are oleophilic, making them suitable for use in oil–water separation, anti‐biofouling and packaging, and other applications apart from water repellent clothing.",

Typically, LED backlights are often paired with inorganic phosphors made from rare‐earth elements (REEs) to tune the emission lineshapes for different applications.

Herein organic hybrid LEDs are developed using organic dyes synthesized from an abundant and non‐toxic natural product (theobromine) to replace REE phosphors. The resulted hybrid LED generates continuous emission from 400–740 nm, resulting in a high color rendering index (the current industry standard) of 90 and a color fidelity index (the most advanced and comprehensive standard) of 92, challenging commercial LEDs based on REE phosphors. In addition, the light‐converting composite is made from 99 wt% SBS, an inexpensive industrial polymer, and 1 wt% theobromine dyes, reducing the cost of the light converter to ¢1.30 for a 1 W LED, compared to approximately ¢ 19.2 of commercial products. The light converting efficiency of the dye‐SBS composite is 82%. Excited state kinetics experiments are also conducted to provide guidance to further increase the light‐converting efficiency of the theobromine dyes while maintaining excellent color rendering and fidelity.",

After silylation treatment, the resultant powder exhibits high efficiency to congeal, a series of floating oils, as well as the great oil recovery ability. The easy availability of pulping byproducts, scalable preparation method, and excellent spill oil treatment ability hold promise for developing new bio‐based oil spill agents.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To address the fundamental challenge of resource sustainability and to effectively deal with issues pertaining to supply chain resilience, cost efficiency, environmental impact, and the ability to meet specific local needs; there is an urgent need for high‐grade battery anode materials produced locally from readily available raw materials. In this work, synthesis of high‐quality graphitic carbon (GH) derived from human hair is demonstrated using an in‐house engineered reactor based on Joule's Flash heating method. The GH is characterized using various techniques to examine its chemical composition, particle morphology, crystallinity, and demonstrate its usability as an anode material for lithium‐ion batteries. Fabricated coin cell with active material exhibits a gravimetric capacity of 320 mAh g −1 at a current density of 30 mA g −1 (equivalent to a C rate of ≈0.1C) over the 100 cycles. The in situ and ex situ studies using XRD, Raman, XPS, and UPS techniques conclude that during the initial charge cycle for GH, lithium ions diffused into the electrode during the resting period are effectively removed. This not only improves the lithium inventory to start with but also mitigates subsequent solvent degradation during solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. Thus, these improvements ultimately enhance the capacity of the anode to 500mAh g −1 at a current density of 20 mA g −1 . The study offers the potential to initiate a new realm of research by redirecting the focus to a material once considered as mere waste.",

In this research, reduced graphitic carbon oxide (rGO)‐Cu nanoparticles crosslinked with collagen support (rGO‐Cu/Coll) are employed as an efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of polystyrene (PS) nano plastics in water. It is shown that rGO‐Cu/Coll nanocomposite can degrade PS nano plastics when subjected to simulated visible light and direct sunlight. In the photocatalytic degradation of PS nano plastics, the reactive radical species ( • OH and O 2 •− ) produced on the surfaces of rGO‐Cu/Coll nanocomposite materials play major roles in de‐polymerization. The investigation of the FESEM, Raman, and UV–vis spectra of the irradiated and non‐irradiated samples reveal observable changes, including the distorted morphology and formation of a new band, with longer exposure times and greater degradation. Additionally, evidence for the photodegradation of PS chains is demonstrated by the observed increase in the intensities of the carboxylate, carbonyl, and hydroxyl absorption regions of the ATR‐FTIR spectra. The study provides a simple approach to the battle against plastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems using green photocatalysts under visible light including direct sunlight without consuming additional energy.",

These membranes can simultaneously function as an adsorber, a photo‐catalyst, and an electrocatalyst to efficiently remove dye pollutes from industrial waste water. Further researches reveal that the formation of p‐n type heterojunction inside of the N‐CNTM and N‐TiO 2 ‐CNTM, can improve the hole separation and charge storage abilities, resulting in the efficient removal of dyes in the industrial waste water.

Principle chemical analysis combined with optotracing, in which the fluorescent tracer molecule Carbotrace 680 generates a visual map of the native tissues’ lignocellulose anatomy at sub‐cellular resolution, enables informed design of a mild recovery process.

However, its susceptibility to forming Li 2 CO 3 upon atmospheric exposure leads to performance degradation, limiting its application. This study introduces a co‐doping strategy of Mg and Ta to enhance the properties of garnet electrolytes. Pure cubic Mg and Ta‐doped LLZO electrolytes are successfully synthesized using the solid‐state reaction method. Experimental results, coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculation, reveal that Mg 2+ doping occurs primarily at the La site (24c). This substitution, given the substantial disparity in ionic radii between Mg 2+ and La 3+ , effectively narrows the transport bottleneck for Li‐ions, resulting in a decreased ionic conductivity and an increased activation energy.

Notably, after 4 months of atmospheric exposure, its ionic conductivity decreased to ≈78% of the initial value, attributable to Li 2 CO 3 formation.

To address this, an ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst is designed with ultrafine alloyed FeNi nanoparticles encapsulated in a 3D interconnected N‐ doped carbon network structure, featuring a carbon nitride backbone enclosed in graphitic carbon. The FeNi electrocatalyst (3DFeNiPDC) showed good bifunctional activity toward both ORR and OER in the basic medium with a low overpotential value of 30 mV for ORR and 6 mV for OER compared to its state‐of‐the‐art counterparts Pt/C, and RuO 2 , respectively. Utilizing 3DFeNiPDC in a rechargeable Zn‐air battery (RZAB) yields an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.35 V, a maximum power density of 232 mW cm −2 , and an energy density of 707 W h kg −1 . Additionally, a flexible RZAB employing 3DFeNiPDC demonstrates an OCV of 1.4 V with various bending angles. These finding suggest 3DFeNiPDC as a viable alternative to noble metal‐based RZABs, offering superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability, particularly with its enhanced air‐breathing properties facilitating improved operability under practical conditions.",

The electrocatalyst is nickel‐iron oxide (NiFeOx) which is deposited by chronoamperometry on nickel, iron, titanium, and stainless steel substrates. The process of electrodeposition is optimized to achieve the lowest overpotential for the water oxidation reaction. The four electrodes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and glow‐discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) to describe the effect of the substrate on the nature of the electrocatalyst layer. Electrochemical tests in 1 m NaOH are applied on the four electrodes to assess the stability and the retention of the electrocatalytic properties of the whole electrode. All electrodes show similar overpotential of ≈0.3 V at 10 mA cm −2 implying that the substrate do not affect the electrocatalytic activity of the NiFeOx. After use, the overpotential increases in a range of 30–50 mV for nickel, iron, and titanium substrates, while stainless steel retains the lowest overpotential with an increase of 10 mV. This limited variation can be the effect of smaller NiFeOx nanoparticles compared to other substrates. XPS analysis reveals that after galvanostatic electrolysis, the oxidation state of Fe shifts slightly from Fe(II) to Fe(III), likely Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3 , while NiO/Ni 2 O 3 change partially to Ni(OH) 2 .",

However, it can be associated with ecotoxic elements release (e.g., V and Cr). The presence of such elements in heterogenous slag at the micro‐scale remains difficult for analysis since microstructural features can be missed during microscopy data inspection, thereby presenting a challenge in understanding how ecotoxic elements exist in slag. Here, an unsupervised machine learning‐based technique is used to analyze slag's microstructural features. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) data are analyzed through Hierarchical Density‐Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) method. Results show that passive CO 2 mineralization has occurred in situ in the studied samples, on the surface, and within their pores. Additionally, V and Cr regions with equivalent diameters &lt; 42 µm can exist within slag, potentially making such elements prone to mobilization due to slag pulverization. Interrogation of the samples with Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (LA‐ICP‐MS) confirms the distribution of the elements obtained from the clustering algorithm and further demonstrates that up to 84 and 9 ppm of V and Cr are incorporated in the precipitated calcite, respectively. This implies that ecotoxic elements may be immobilized through calcite precipitation.",

Emissions and energy analyses show the ability of HRP to lower the CO 2 emissions for acetic acid synthesis by 74% compared to a conventional steam and autothermal reforming route. HRP also offers a potential 34% reduction in capital costs. Compared to a dry reforming based acetic acid production route, HRP has the potential for significantly lower costs.

Despite of mesmerizing optical properties, the synthesis of these all‐inorganic Mn halide compounds is followed by complex and toxic processes. Second, a precise control over the synthesis parameters is mandatory to achieve their pure emissions. Therefore, an ecologically sustainable water‐based solution approach is adapted here to tailor the phases and emissions of cesium manganese bromide (Cs‐Mn‐Br) perovskite derivatives. It is observed that a controlled injection of solution stabilizer plays a pivotal role in engineering the intrinsic properties of Mn halide perovskites.

The oxidized blend with high cellulose and carboxylate content of 1221 ± 82 mmol COO − per kg of cotton, is pelletised into a masterbatch and further in situ extruded into nanocomposite filaments for 3D printing. The carboxyl groups introduced on the polycotton‐based filters enable cotton fibrillation into nanoscaled fibers during mechanical treatment and extrusion resulting to a variety of functional and high surface‐finish quality models, including filters and fashion accessories. The electrostatic interactions with positively charged species, such as methylene blue (MB), facilitate their adsorption from water while exhibiting promising adsorption capacities. The adsorption of MB follows the Freundlich model and depends on the printed porosity of the filter. A “trash to treasure” concept for textile waste is further corroborated through the use of the developed 3D printing filament into commodity products.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Silicon (Si), known for its high theoretical capacity, holds promise for developing high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). However, the intrinsic low conductivity and substantial volume expansion limit its commercial application. Developing a binder that can suppress the massive volume expansion while improving Si conductivity is particularly important for LIBs based on Si anode. Here, grafting natural adhesive cationic guar gum (CGG) with small molecular acrylamide (AM) is proposed and applied it to the Si‐based anode. The rigid guar gum main chain and the elastic polymerized acrylamide (pAM) side chain forms a 3D network that completely encapsulated Si nanoparticles and cross‐linked with the natural hydroxyl groups on the surface of Si particles through abundant functional groups. Numerous link anchors and robust mechanical networks facilitate lithium‐ion transport and effectively mitigated the significant stress generated by silicon during charge and discharge cycles. Based on this innovative design, the Si@CGG@pAM@SP (Super P) electrode demonstrates excellent long‐term cycle stability and rate performance. The Si@CGG@pAM@SP electrode preserves 2086 mAh g −1 discharge capacity after 100 cycles (corresponding to 91.5% capacity retention). Physical characterization and electrochemical tests confirm the rationality of the polymer binder design, serving as a valuable reference for the material design of lithium‐ion batteries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Electronics have contributed to the advancement of healthcare, wellness, security, and mobility, resulting in a higher standard of living. However, these ever‐accelerating advancements and widespread application come at the cost of a shortened product life cycle and increase in produced E‐waste which poses a significant environmental challenge. Recycling E‐waste is challenging due to the complexity of electronics and packaging, hindering component retrieval for reuse. While sustainable materials for electronics have been researched, sustainable integrated circuit (IC) packaging for conventional electronics remains unexplored. This study introduces a method involving dissolvable additively manufactured packaging materials to recover commercial‐off‐the‐shelf (COTS) chips from used electronics, which will alleviate supply‐chain stress, reduce the need for manufacturing similar chips, and minimize environmental impact. In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), are explored as potential dissolvable semiconductor packaging materials. Optimal dissolving conditions allow chip recovery in less than 11 min for PVA and 2 min for ABS. This approach offers a sustainable packaging method for commercial electronic chips that matches conventional packaging performance with the added functionality of recoverable and recyclable components, contributing to the gap in sustainability and recycling for conventional electronics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Within food Supply Chains (SCs), food products labeled through Geographical Indications (GIs) hold paramount importance as distinctive and culturally significant entities, ensuring the integrity and distinctiveness of regional specialties. By strictly regulating the geographic origin and production methods, the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) not only guarantees the preservation of traditional practices but also safeguards the cultural legacy and identity of the regions where genuine PDO products are produced. However, the very mechanisms safeguarding PDO authenticity can be exploited within globalized food systems, creating opportunities for fraudulent activities and intentional or unintentional adulteration. This study specifically delves into the overarching realm of PDO SCs, using PDO Feta cheese as a prominent case study. Through an assessment of Feta cheese SC in Greece, encompassing the Delphi Technique with the amalgamation of the design stages of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), Vulnerabilities Assessment and Critical Control Point (VACCP), and Threat Assessment and Critical Control Point (TACCP) methodologies, the operations, vulnerabilities, and critical control points are scrutinized. The results indicate multifaceted vulnerabilities and Critical Control Points (CCPs) in the Feta cheese SC that need to be addressed and constitute a precursor for augmenting PDO SCs. Moreover, the utilization of Blockchain Technology (BT) exhibits intrinsic potential for enhancing the administration of supply chains with the potential to fundamentally transform data management practices and foster increased levels of trust among stakeholders.",

MgO serves as a competitive sorbent in SEWGS, removing CO 2 in situ. Yet the reaction mechanism of SEWGS employing MgO is not well understood. In this work, the reaction mechanism of SEWGS on the MgO surface is revealed by density functional theory (DFT) analysis. The MgO(110) surface shows a remarkable enhancement for SEWGS. Spontaneous dissociation of H 2 O is observed whether in the presence of CO or CO 2 , leading to the enrichment of hydroxyl groups for subsequent reactions. CO 2 generated is captured by surface basic sites, resulting in the formation of MgCO 3 . The presence of the generated hydroxyl group enhances the dehydrogenation reaction on the surface, facilitating hydrogen production. The reaction pathway is described as follows. First, spontaneous dissociation of H 2 O occurs when co‐adsorbed with CO on the MgO surface. Then, two hydroxyl groups interact, yielding atomic O for CO oxidization and atomic H for H 2 generation. Ultimately, CO 2 is captured by the surface while H 2 desorbs from the surface. The rate‐limiting step is H 2 generation with an energy barrier of 0.68 eV. The calculation results elucidate the enhancement mechanism of MgO on the SEWGS process.",

Furthermore, this MASS approach is also employed to integrate multimodal luminescence into one single La 2 MgGeO 6 matrix with triple dopants (Mn 4+ , Yb 3+ , and Er 3+ ) for light conversion. Impressively, multimodal and multicolor luminescence is obtained with different responsiveness of external stimulations. Notably, the energy transfer among different trapping levels is observed upon photo‐stimulation.

To investigate the corrosion resistance of TiMn 2 , N‐doped TiMn 2 (N‐TiMn 2 ) is prepared by the high‐temperature nitriding method. The high charge transfer resistance ( R po ) of N‐TiMn 2 reduces the electron transfer ability of its surface and improves the chemical stability.

From a sustainability perspective, the newly developed membranes show an impressive ability to inhibit yeast growth by 75%, with complete degradation observed in only 7 days. This underscores their potential to mitigate environmental impact and promote environmentally friendly packaging solutions to reduce both plastic waste and food loss while maintaining safety and quality. However, the economic sustainability of these membranes is still an open challenge. It becomes clear that the main bottleneck does not lie in the innovative production technology, but rather in the prices of raw materials, particularly natural additives. This underscores the need for supportive measures from institutions to incentivize the transition to sustainable packaging alternatives and the importance of the full circularity concept. This work shows that achieving the European goal of zero plastic waste requires concrete efforts.",

The oil refining industry generates large quantities of sulfur byproducts, which pose significant environmental risks. Inverse vulcanization offers a promising method to convert this waste into valuable polymers, but it traditionally relies on costly and environmentally harmful catalysts. The development of benign, sustainable catalysts is essential to making sulfur polymerization more eco‐friendly and scalable. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of the SG biogenic catalyst compared to the conventional chemical catalyst zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (Zn(DTC) 2 ). Rheological characterizations reveal that the SG catalyst not only outperforms Zn(DTC) 2 at elevated temperatures but also provides superior moisture resistance, enhancing polymer durability. Additionally, the SG‐catalyzed polymer exhibits better elasticity and structural integrity under mechanical stress. A density functional theory (DFT)‐based study further supports these findings, showing that the SG biochar matrix enables stronger Zn‐S coordination, resulting in improved polymer properties. These results highlight the potential of this biogenic catalyst to revolutionize sulfur polymerization, paving the way for more sustainable practices in the chemical industry by converting waste sulfur into valuable polymer resources.",

Both electrochemically and photocatalytic performance are amplified at an optimized selenide content denoted as CNCD‐0.5 due to its favourable characteristics and morphology. From the electrochemical measurements, the battery‐type performance of the CNCD‐0.5 is established from the well‐distinguished redox peaks.

Previous research, primarily experimental, recognized the synergy of combining PV with green or cool roofs. However, the influence of geographic and climatic factors on the performance of these combined systems, particularly in future climates affected by climate change, remains unclear. This work integrates three roof configurations (gravel, green, and white) into rooftop solar energy modeling across thirteen cities with different climate types, under current and future climate scenarios. Results indicate limited efficiency gains (&lt; 2%) across all cities and climates, challenging previous findings. Yield is expected to increase in some cities receiving more solar irradiation in the future but decrease in others due to rising temperatures. Green and cool roofs can partially offset the effects of climate change on yield. PV‐white roofs consistently outperform PV‐green roofs, with the performance gap expected to widen in future climates. PV‐green roofs excel in tropical climates with high irradiation and precipitation levels.

    "abstract": "Abstract Free‐standing, highly transparent and flexible films are obtained from solvent casting of aqueous colloidal dispersions of surface‐deacetylated chitin nanocrystals. The Young's modulus and the water absorption of the films is further modulated by the addition of three natural polyphenols, i.e., epigallocatechingallate, tannic acid and one lignosulfonate, which differ one another in terms of molecular weight, and overall amount of hydroxy, phenolic and catecholic functionalities. The polyphenolic molecules create an extensive network of hydrogen bonds with the nanocrystals, thus controlling interfacial interactions. Therefore, they act as crosslinkers exerting a reinforcing and structuring action and hampering water absorption. The films do not show dissolution in water upon 7 days of incubation at room temperature, and the release profiles of the polyphenols in aqueous media evidence hindered Fickian diffusion kinetics confirming the presence of interactions with the nanostructured matrix. Lastly, the developed films possess bioactive properties, as they show both radical scavenging and antimicrobial activity. These characteristics are enhanced by the phenolic and, most importantly, catecholic moieties present in tannins (and to a lesser extent in lignins), allowing to reach bactericidal effects as high as 99.99% against both Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative strains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Atmospheric pollution has been recognized as a primary global emergency, especially in large cities and industrial areas. Among the most common harmful pollutants, nitrogen oxides (NO x ) are responsible for a plethora of adverse effects, and their effective elimination from air has become an imperative task. In this regard, photocatalysis stands as an attractive technology for NO x degradation, provided that low‐cost and efficient visible ‐light photocatalysts are developed. In this regard, the construction of heterojunctions between energy band‐matched semiconductors is an effective strategy to boost the ultimate material photoactivity. In the present study, green heterocomposites based on MgAlTi layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) are prepared using an amenable and cost‐effective route. A proper modulation of the system characteristics, as demonstrated by a comprehensive investigation, enabled to obtain very attractive DeNO x performances thanks to the efficient construction of MgAlTi/gCN heterojunctions with tailored features. The formation of the target heterocomposites significantly enhances the visible light photoactivity of the pristine LDH, boosting nitrogen monoxide transformation to nitrites/nitrates with a remarkable recycling stability. Overall, the presently reported results open the door to a profitable system exploitation for air purification under real‐world conditions, with considerable impact on both human wellbeing and environmental protection.",

A unique bio‐based triphasic nanocomposite (Fe 3 O 4 /α‐Fe 2 O 3 /carbon) is synthesized and its superior properties are demonstrated to address both types of environmental pollution. The nanocomposite, derived from lightweight apple tree roots, is used for Pb (II) ion removal from aqueous solutions via adsorption and magnetic separation. The biomass‐derived highly porous biochar decorated with iron‐oxide showed adsorption efficiency of nearly 100% and corresponding capacity of 149 mg.g −1 under optimal conditions for initial Pb (II) concentration of 50 mg.L −1 . Furthermore, a remarkable adsorption capacity of 731 mg.g −1 is achieved using lower amount of the adsorbent for a slightly lower efficiency (97%). In addition, the mesoporous composite showed excellent EMW absorption efficiency with effective absorption bandwidth of 7.8 GHz and reflection loss of −61.7 dB, arising from very good impedance matching, and high dielectric and magnetic losses. This work establishes the multifunctional properties of the synthesized composite, and addresses the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate action, including pollution management).",

In this work, a series of ultra‐thin N‐doped carbon coated Fe‐CoP (Fe‐CoP@NC) are prepared by phosphating Fe‐Co‐Co Prussian blue analogs (Fe‐Co‐Co PBA) in different degrees for the broad‐spectrum photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

The excellent stability of Fe‐CoP@NC‐3 is proved by cyclic experiments. The outstanding photocatalytic H 2 production activity of Fe‐CoP@NC‐3 can be ascribed to the strong electron coupling effect between Fe‐CoP and N‐doped carbon layer. The photogenerated electrons of Fe‐CoP are transferred to the N‐doped carbon layer, which is electron transport mediator accelerating the electron transfer and synergetic improving the hydrogen evolution efficiency.

In the past decades, huge progress has been achieved in establishing sustainable machine condition monitoring systems via various sensing technologies. Yet, the dependence on external power sources or batteries for sensing and data communication remains a challenge. In addition, energy harvesting and sensing are dynamically growing research fields introducing various working mechanisms and designs for improved performance, flexibility, and integrability. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) have been applied as a new technology for energy harvesting and sensing to monitor machine performance. This manuscript presents the potential application of TENG for self‐powered sensors and energy harvesting technology for machine condition monitoring, where the developmental aspects of TENG‐based devices including the robustness of design and device integration to machine elements are reviewed. For better comparison, the performance of various reported devices is summarized. Simultaneously, the advanced results achieved in employing TENGs for various condition analysis techniques and self‐powered wireless communication for machine condition monitoring are discussed.

Using biodegradable and porous biomass materials as evaporators to fabricate high‐performance SSG devices is a promising route, but the poor efficiency and fussy and energy‐intensive manufacturing process for biomass material‐based evaporators will restrict their practical application. Here, an old commercial cotton quilt is used to prepare porous cotton fiber sponges (CFS) via a simple and scalable mechanical foaming strategy. After being decorated by the polypyrrole (PPy), the CFS@PPy sponge with a hierarchical porous structure shows broadband light absorption capacity, good hydrophilicity, and excellent photothermal capacity. The obtained sponge can be directly used as an evaporator floating on the seawater and shows a high steam‐generation efficiency of 85.07% under 1 sun irradiation. Additionally, it can be used as a photothermal material to construct a solar thermoelectric generation (STG) device and achieve an enhanced open‐circuit voltage (V out ) of 0.4 V and output current (I out ) of ≈59.6 mA under 5 sun irradiations. With the help of a boost converter, the power generation from the STG device can continuously charge the electric bulb and wristband.",

This work demonstrates the facile coupling of carbon/NiFe‐layered double hydroxide (LDH) onto flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates deposited by blade coating and spray coating techniques. These low‐temperature solution processes enable high‐throughput electrode fabrication. The resulting carbon electrode exhibits sheet resistance of 25 Ω sq −1 , comparable to other state‐of‐the‐art works, and displays excellent adhesion to the substrate and catalyst layer, thereby ensuring system stability. Remarkably, the developed electrode exhibits high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving an overpotential of 215.9 and 267.4 mV at 10 mA cm − 2 in rigid and flexible substrates respectively, and maintaining its performance even at 10 mA cm − 2 for 24 h.

    "abstract": "Abstract Photocatalysis technology of g‐C 3 N 4 is of great value in wastewater treatment, thus calling for developing a concise and high‐efficiency method to improve its photocatalytic efficiency. Here, a novel photocatalyst consisting of tourmaline particles (TPs) and graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) is prepared by a step calcining method with enhanced photocatalytic performance. The self‐polarized electric field of TPs attracts the photogenerated electrons generated by the catalyst and delays the recombination rate of electron‐hole pairs, for which reason the prepared photocatalyst exhibits a wider spectral response and stronger photocatalytic activity. The mechanism analysis exhibits that the reactive substances including h + , ·OH, 1 O 2 , and ·O 2 − generated by TPs/g‐C 3 N 4 effectively eliminate the contaminant during photocatalysis. The degradation efficiency of Rhodamine B (RhB) of g‐C 3 N 4 ‐0.5% TPs is increased from 88.47% to 97.76% after 30 min illumination compared with pure g‐C 3 N 4 . Furthermore, to facilitate catalyst recycling and reuse, a photocatalytic lignocellulose membrane is prepared. After five cycles, the degradation efficiency of the membrane decreases from 97.89% to 95.54%, still maintaining 97.60%.

The resultant modified biochar particles maintain a highly porous structure and present a remarkable CO 2 adsorption capacity (up to 4.80 mmol g −1 for N@BC ), which is attributed to the synergy of their large total surface area (527 m 2 g −1 ) and microporosity (pore diameter = 21 Å), with a high content of nitrogen and oxygen heteroatom moieties (40.4% N, 11.4% O). Their application as heterogeneous bifunctional catalysts in CO 2 cycloaddition to epichlorohydrin is performed, in the absence of any solvent or co‐catalyst, under moderate conditions (20 bar CO 2 , 120 °C), leading to good conversions (up to 58% conversion) and excellent selectivity for cyclic carbonates.

First, the results explain that the main drawback of the unmodified material, namely its voltammetric peaks at high voltages, is due to the overly strong adsorption of lithium ions. Second, it is demonstrated that hydrogenation of the material leads to milder open‐circuit voltages without compromising the capacity of the anode, and lowers the diffusion barrier to only 0.06eV for both Li and K ions.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cobalt‐based spinel oxides, such as Co 3 O 4 , have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for chlorine and bromine evolution reactions (CER and BrER) in recent years. However, the role of Co valence in determining the exceptional performance of Co 3 O 4 for both CER and BrER remains ambiguous due to the coexistence of both octahedrally coordinated Co 3+ (Co 3+ Oh ) and tetrahedrally coordinated Co 2+ (Co 2+ Td ) sites, despite their high catalytic activity and stability. Herein, combining experiment results and electrochemical data analysis, the Co 3+ Oh site functions as the primary active site for CER is demonstrated. In contrast, for BrER, both Co 3+ Oh and Co 2+ Td sites exhibit good catalytic activity, with Co 3+ Oh sites displaying better BrER catalytic performance than Co 2+ Td sites. To further enhance the CER catalytic activity of the Co 3+ Oh site, inert Co 2+ Td is replaced with Cu 2+ cations. As expected, CuCo 2 O 4 featuring an optimized Co 3+ Oh site demonstrates an overpotential of 24 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 while exhibiting exceptional stability for ≈60 h, surpassing the performance of the majority of non‐noble and even noble metal‐based electrocatalysts reported to date.

Within robotics, silicone‐based soft grippers are recently developed owing to their high adaptability and versatility allowing to deal with various objects. However, the soft grippers are difficult to recycle and may cause increased environmental impact. Here biodegradable soft pneumatic actuators reinforced by cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) distributed in a matrix of gelatin are presented. The results show that adding CNF enables 3D printability and provides tunable mechanical properties for the actuators. The actuator performance, with a bending angle of 80° and a blocked force of 0.1 N at 15 kPa, is comparable to state‐of‐the‐art mold‐casted pneumatic actuators from conventional silicone materials while being exclusively composed of non‐toxic, biodegradable materials and fabricated by additive manufacturing techniques. Moreover, the actuators exhibit self‐healing ability and enable object manipulation when formed in a gripper configuration. The mold‐free approach and achieved functionalities establish new opportunities for soft‐robotics, across various fields including healthcare, packaging, or even environmental monitoring. The performance of the gripper shows that CNF can be used in the creation of eco‐friendly high‐performance soft robots and contribute to the advancement of sustainable and green robotics.",

In this work, a series of rare‐earth (RE) elements doped RuO 2 nanorods is developed as high‐performance OER electrocatalysts. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that RE doping regulates the local coordination environment around Ru sites, lowers the valance of Ru, and shortens the Ru─O─Ru(M) bond length, which enhances structural stability. Among the RE‐RuO 2 samples, Sm‐RuO 2 exhibits remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 283 mV to reach 100 mA cm −2 and maintained stability for over 140 h at 10 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the PEM electrolyzer using Sm‐RuO 2 as the anode can be stably operated at 500 mA cm −2 for 15 h. Electrochemical analysis, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy show that Sm doping lowers the d ‐band center, reduces the adsorption energy of O intermediates to enhance the OER activity, and restrains excessive oxidation of Ru sites while stabilizing lattice oxygen during the OER process, thereby enhancing OER stability.

Such biomasses are functionalized in a water solution with (3‐aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to introduce primary amino groups, and two different functionalization procedures are adopted: the first requires conventional heating steps, whereas the second implies microwave radiation use. The main outcomes from the characterizations evidence that the materials prepared with the thermal treatment are stabler than those obtained by the microwave‐assisted procedure and that bamboo‐derived samples react with the (3‐aminopropyl)triethoxysilane through different functionalities other than hydroxyl groups. Finally, the antibacterial activity measured against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus shows that all the functionalized samples could efficiently remove Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacteria (removal &gt; 93%). Moreover, active filters are realized by packing the material powders: when the bacterial inoculum passes through them in a continuous flow, some differences are observed between cellulose and bamboo‐based materials, but the overall performances show that after 17 min and five recirculation cycles, both the samples reach an excellent Escherichia coli removal of about 100%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hole Transport Materials (HTMs) are one of the key elements in Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) and specifically polymeric HTMs have recently emerged as one of the most viable options to couple excellent performance and good stability. However, most are processed only in aromatic solvents (e.g., toluene or chlorobenzene), thus negatively impacting the overall sustainability of the device. In this contribution, four novel polymers are synthesized specifically designed to be processable in less harsh, non‐aromatic, and non‐chlorinated solvent (i.e., Tetrahydrofuran – THF): the conventional PTAA scaffold is modified by the insertion of a phenothiazine (PTZ) and by the modulation of the methyl moieties on the peripheral benzene. Alternatively, a benzothiadiazole moiety is also added. The polymers are then implemented in flexible PSCs (F‐PSCs) that have recently attracted increased attention due to their high power‐to‐weight ratio. The THF‐processed P1 (a PTZ‐PTAA copolymer with one methyl group substituted) reaches an overall efficiency of 9.10%, outperforming THF‐processed PTAA (PCE = 8.25%) and approaching the one of toluene‐processed reference (PCE = 9.30%). Furthermore, P1 shows better stability under light soaking conditions. To rationalize these results, different characterizations are presented, including optoelectronic techniques, thermal and surface analyses, and GWAXS measurements.",

Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) benefit these systems by providing additional design flexibility, tuning light transmission for plant growth while generating electricity. Herein, design guidelines for LSCs in agrivoltaic greenhouses are determined given the two competing priorities of light utilization, crop yield and energy generation. Using a comprehensive model, the impact of LSC design choices on the greenhouse environment, energy generation, crop yield, and economic value in 48 locations across the United States is evaluated. It is shown that the solar cell coverage ratio and the greenhouse's heating demands determine the energy offset provided by the LSC. For improving crop yield, luminophore selection should maximize transmitted red light. The sensitivity of the economic value to crop yield, thus dictating luminophore selection for optimizing plant growth, is demonstrated. LSC greenhouses are as profitable as conventional greenhouses generally for states below 40 °N. Future improvements to LSC manufacturing may allow previously unprofitable LSC greenhouses to become economically viable in northern states. This work showcases the broad design space and strong potential for LSCs in agrivoltaics.",

Coupling donor (Titanium Oxide, TiO 2 ) and acceptor (Cadmium Sulfide, CdS) nanocrystals with DNA yield a 5.25‐fold improvement in CO 2 reduction over simply mixing the photocatalysts in solution. In addition, it is demonstrated that electron transfer occurs over distances far greater than those achieved with polyethylene glycol spacer. Efficient Z‐scheme photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 is observed for DNA lengths of 10–80 bases, which separate the donor and acceptor nanocrystals by 3–24 nm. More significantly, an interparticle distance of 9–10 nm yields the highest conversion of CO 2 , which is found for nanocrystals spaced using either linear 30mer double strand DNA (dsDNA) or a 40mer DNA composed of both linear and hairpin DNA. When the amount of 30mer DNA linking the photocatalysts is lowered, a corresponding decrease in CO 2 reduction yields is seen, showcasing the role of DNA in mediating electron transfer. These results demonstrate the highly unique attributes of DNA as both a templating agent for precise nanoscale assembly and for enabling charge transport.

Under the traditional battery development principle, a Zn–Ce cell has to be operated with an acidic electrolyte to sustain the redox reactions of Ce compounds (Ce(IV) ↔ Ce(III)) at the positive electrode. However, the use of an acidic electrolyte poses a serious corrosion issue on Zn and limits the electrochemical potential of the Zn electrode. Here, a novel Zn–Ce battery is presented with an alkaline electrolyte at the negative electrode side (anolyte) and an acidic electrolyte at the positive electrode side (catholyte). The two different‐pH liquid electrolytes are separated by a sodium‐ion (Na + ‐ion) solid‐electrolyte separator. The Na + ‐ion, shuttling through the solid electrolyte, is not involved in the redox reactions but rather acts as an ionic mediator to sustain the redox reactions at the negative and positive electrodes. Use of an alkaline anolyte not only eliminates the Zn corrosion problem but also enhances the cell voltage of the Zn–Ce system. In addition, the use of a solid electrolyte prevents the crossover of the liquid electrode materials (Ce(IV) or Ce(III)) and circumvents the concerns of Zn dendrite penetration.",

    "abstract": "Massive usage of non-renewable fuels causes significant amounts of greenhouse gases emission leading to global warming. A transition from such a fossil-based economy to a more sustainable economy is therefore mandatory. Among the different options, valorization of biomass, a renewable and abundant carbon source in nature, into fuels, chemicals, and materials is an important opportunity to realize such a sustainable world. Provided there is proper processing and technology development, and a critical analysis of their life cycles, such green carbon sources have the potential to contribute to a more sustainable future. This special issue showcases several aspects of current developments for biomass conversion and utilization. Both the current state of the art, as well as critical discussions and definition of real challenges can be found in the various contributions. Topics that are touched on include biomass derived char supported catalysts, as well as novel solvents dedicated for biomass fractionation. Also manifested in this issue is the diversity of catalytic technologies for transformation of different biomass feedstock to fuel additives, chemicals, and polymer building blocks. As expected, catalytic hydrogenolysis plays a dominant role both in the biomass degradation such as lignin depolymerization, and subsequent transformation of the lignin derivatives such as phenolics, into fuel additives and chemicals. Catalytic oxidation through either thermal catalysis or electro-catalysis elegantly shows its ability to produce functional chemicals and polymer precursors. Acid catalysis complements various routes for renewable chemicals production, as it is shown here. Biomass pretreatment using alkaline treatment retains its critical effect on modifying the inherent properties of the biomass feedstock with regard to the further depolymerization and upgrading. In addition to catalytic technologies, this issue highlights new progress in catalyst development and fabrication such as the use of bimetallic catalysts for glycerol oxidation at low temperature, and a solid super-acid based catalyst for selective oxygen removal. The design of multiple catalytic functionalities and mesostructured porosity seems to be a constant in the achievement of catalysts displaying better performance. We sincerely thank the editorial team of Advanced Sustainable Systems for their support in coordinating this special issue and handling all the manuscripts. We also are grateful and respectful to the authors and reviewers for their important contributions and efforts. We hope that this special issue will inspire many scientists in this field to advance the (catalytic) conversion and utilization of biomass towards renewable fuels, chemicals, and materials, ultimately with the general goal to make the world more sustainable.

    "abstract": "Abstract There has been a growing trend for buildings with large glazing size. As a trade‐off, this comes with enhanced solar heat input and/or reduced thermal insulation. Several approaches are being followed to reduce the energy consumption in these buildings, including the prolific field of smart windows. In a previous report, a fluidic window device for thermal harvesting and air‐conditioning was introduced. Using this example, the impact of a building's window‐to‐wall ratio on the triple glazed fluidic window's energy consumption and user thermal comfort is evaluated, providing design guidelines for large‐scale implementation of such smart windows with real‐world buildings. The analysis shows that the proposed window design reduces the primary energy demand as compared to using a conventional air‐conditioning system. Building simulation results indicate that the system enables satisfying thermal comfort for buildings with different window‐to‐wall ratios. Although a higher window‐to‐wall ratio improves the heat pump efficiency, it requires more heating and cooling energy. On‐device photovoltaic modules may be used for changing this relationship. In this case, the proposed device may become self‐sufficient once the transfer efficiency is high enough. It is argued that similar considerations should be applied to other types of smart window technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polymeric carbon nitride (CN) has emerged as a promising semiconductor in photoelectrochemical devices, thanks to its unique electronic and catalytic properties, low price, stability in various chemical environments, and benign nature. Decent progress in the deposition and growth of CN layers on substrates has been achieved using several deposition and growth methods; however, the properties of the layer, including the quality of its contact with the substrate and its structural properties, are still largely dependent on the surface properties of said substrate. Here, a new approach is introduced in which a spray‐coated seeding layer composed of CN monomers directs the growth of a homogenous, thick CN layer on a substrate by calcination at high temperature in the presence of melamine vapor. Uniform CN layers with strong adhesion to the substrate are obtained. The influence of the seeding layer and the vapor composition on the photoelectrochemical, optical, and structural properties is studied in detail. The best‐performing electrode, based on urea as the seeding layer, demonstrates good activity as a photoanode in photoelectrochemical cells, reaching up to 300 µA cm −2 in the presence of a hole scavenger.",

Here, a nanostructured material is engineered and a conceptual study developed—adsorption‐coupled Fenton‐like reaction (ACFLR)—and it is shown that adsorptive concentration of a pollutant on an adsorbent favors Fenton‐like degradation. Sodium alginate (SAG) is introduced as a soft‐gelling template for in situ generation of FeOOH, which stabilizes graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets (SAG‐FeOOH/GO) to yield active Fenton‐like catalytic adsorptive sites. The catalyst architecture—the biopolymer‐functionalized FeOOH‐supporting GO nanosheets—are responsible for the ACFLR. Methylene blue (MB) is concentrated on SAG‐FeOOH/GO via electrostatic and pi–pi interactions and these interactions are responsible for the adsorptive removal of MB. After adsorptive concentration of MB on the surface of SAG‐FeOOH/GO, the proximity of Fenton‐like catalytic sites enhances the efficient use of the short‐lived reactive oxygen species compared to that of the MB in bulk solution (nonadsorbed MB) for efficient Fenton‐like reactions. The role of adsorption during the Fenton‐like reaction is proved by the structural degradation of MB by the concentrated MB on SAG‐FeOOH/GO under Fenton‐like conditions followed by desorption, which gives the concentration of degraded MB after the step‐wise action of adsorption and Fenton‐like degradation.",

Often photocatalysts are costly and employ complex fabrication processes that give limited efficiency which therefore inhibits widespread industrial proliferation. To address this issue, a simple room temperature alloying process followed by sonication for the preparation of photocatalytically active GaZnO nanosheets confined on a metallic GaZn core is reported. The material is characterized with X‐ray diffraction, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical techniques. These analyses confirm the presence of a metallic GaZn core decorated with GaZnO nanosheets. The resultant GaZn/GaZnO catalyst exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange. A high degradation efficiency of 73% is achieved under solar simulated conditions which is attributed to the GaZn core acting as an electron sink allowing for effective charge carrier separation at the surface confined GaZnO sheets and the production of reactive oxygen species.",

In this paper, a self‐blacking aerogel (SBA) is first demonstrated with excellent deposited salt self‐cleaning performance, and the self‐cleaning mechanism is illustrated by the theory of chemical potential. The color of the SBA can be changed from light brown to black under the inducement of water and light, and its light absorption ability clearly increases from 34.5% to 77.0% in the whole spectral range (200–2500 nm). SBA is fabricated by quinoa bran cellulose (QBC) and graphene oxide (GO) with an evaporation rate of 3.6 kg m −2 h −1 under one sun. Importantly, for natural solar irradiation, the average evaporation rate reaches up to 12.6 and 12 kg m −2 day −1 in the period of 15 days of outdoor experiments for pure water and stimulated seawater respectively, which can meet the drinking water demand for 5–6 people.

However, SSG performance is not yet satisfactory due to limited photothermal efficiency and crude thermal management. In addition, real‐time salinity monitoring is still lacking. Herein, inspired by the transpiration of trees, an umbrella‐shaped 3D structure is designed for high‐performance SSG. The water evaporation rate under one sun irradiation is as high as 2.17 kg m −2 h −1 , outcompeting most previous work. The high evaporation rate is primarily attributed to the excellent photothermal effect and maximized utilization of the heat via enhancing water transport and enlarging the effective evaporation area. Due to the existence of an air gap between the umbrella cover and the bulk water, an extra thermal insulator is not needed. Thus, the SSG device is more compact and stable. Moreover, a flexible photonic crystal membrane is constructed to in situ monitor the salinity by the structural color via a visualization method. This SSG device keeps high evaporation rates in seawater desalination, showing great prospects for practical applications.",

Herein, thermoregulation of the catalytic activity of DNAzyme is achieved through the immobilization of DNAzymes into the crosslinked polymeric matrix of poly‐ N ‐isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM) microgels prepared with a microfluidic device. At a temperature lower than the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of pNIPAM, the immobilized DNAzymes exhibit lower catalytic performance due to the restricted entry of DNA substrates into the polymeric networks; while at a temperature higher than the LCST, the hydrophilic DNAzyme structures are exposed to exhibit high catalytic activity due to the shrinking of the pNIPAM networks. Results show a more than 60% of increase in catalytic activity by raising the temperature from 29 to 34 ° C and reversible regulation of the DNAzyme catalytic activity is achieved by cyclic raising and lowering of the solution temperature. Through a simple heating‐centrifugation process, the DNAzyme/pNIPAM microgels can be recycled for further applications. Moreover, by introducing photothermal MXene nanosheets, the remote control of the catalytic activity of the DNAzyme by near‐infrared light irradiation is achieved. These DNAzyme/pNIPAM microgels as low‐cost, stable, reversible, and recyclable biocatalyst may have potential in biosensing and biomedical applications.",

Cities are like engines of growth; when they stop, so does the growth. Therefore, it becomes paramount to build cities that continue to function and do not collapse amidst any crisis. Since economic recovery is underway, this paper examines priority areas for investment to expedite recovery and build back stronger cities. These areas are evaluated based on their contribution to revitalizing public health, economic, social, energy, and environmental sectors. For the analysis, analytical network process (ANP) and fuzzy‐VIKOR are applied. ANP obtains the relative importance of sectors and their respective critical factors after solving a complex relationship among them. The economic sector has the highest weight of 25.8% among the five sectors, while job creation has the highest weight of 10.3% among the fifteen factors. Fuzzy‐VIKOR is used to evaluate different areas and it is found that renewable energy has a greater contribution to the sustainable recovery of major sectors and the long‐term aim of building inclusive green and resilient cities. These insights shall contribute to the conversations already ongoing among city governments, urban planners, civil society organizations, and city dwellers seeking practical solutions to unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic.",

However, the utilization of solar steam evaporators often suffers from a series of problems, such as high cost, complex processes, and low conversion rate, which seriously hinders the development of solar steam devices. Here, a polypyrrole/watermelon pulp (WPPY) evaporator, which is based on soaking freeze‐dried lumpy watermelon pulp (WP) in pyrrole solution, initiating polymerization in the ice bath, followed by heat‐treatment to achieve an efficient solar steam generation (SSG) device, is designed and produced.

Its evaporation rate reaches 1.64 kg m −2 h −1 without additional insulation, while the light‐to‐heat conversion efficiency reaches 96.1% under one solar irradiation (1 kW m −2 ) at the same time. Additionally, it also shows good durability. This environmentally friendly and stable photothermal conversion composite material that shows good cycle stability has great potential for applications in seawater desalination via SSG.",

Herein, MoS x @Pd hybrids were successfully synthesized by using a one‐pot liquid phase solvothermal strategy with stoichiometric excess of Pd. The optimized MoS x @Pd proves to be an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Optimized MoS x @Pd operates the process for hydrogen evolution at the same potential as Pt/C and achieves a low overpotential of 76 mV at −10 mA cm −2 due to improved reaction kinetics and charge transfer processes between Pd and MoS 2 . On top of that, MoS x @Pd exhibits excellent performance and stability as cathode electrocatalyst in a polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer. Simultaneously, the bifunctional electrocatalyst shows enhanced electrocatalytic ORR activity and stability by maintaining 93% of its initial activity outperforming commercial Pt/C. Finally, rotating ring disk electrode analysis reveals that ORR proceeds through the energy efficient 4e − pathway, with water being the main product, rendering MoS x @Pd a promising component for fuel cells.",

Since upcycling strategies are hardly in the limelight, this paper focuses on giving a second life to LiCoO 2 cathode as a dual‐ion battery (DIB) anode. Among many possible recovery approaches explored for cobalt, a microwave‐assisted green leaching method comprising mild leaching agents is chosen for this work. Cobalt is recovered as cobalt oxalate and converted to cobalt/cobalt oxide nanospheres embedded in a porous graphitic carbon matrix (Co 3 O 4 /Co@C). Due to the high working voltage, excellent safety, and environmental friendliness, DIBs are being considered as a replacement for lithium‐ion batteries in specific sectors. In an unconventional approach, the derived Co 3 O 4 /Co@C is effectively employed as an anode material for dual‐ion batteries. The half‐cell demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 550 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 . A full‐cell DIB fabricated using Co 3 O 4 /Co@C, derived from upcycled LiCoO 2 as an anode and graphite as a cathode, shows an appreciable capacity and remarkable cycling stability. This sustainable approach for upcycling exhausted LIBs can pave the way to improve the circular economy of batteries.",

In this work, fibers are fabricated by electrospinning and coated with silk fibroin (SF) for biocompatibility and biologically synthesized silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) for antibacterial activity. The scanning electron microscopy reveals the undistorted morphology and the presence of NPs on fibers. The Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis show the successful incorporation of SF and Ag NPs. The water contact angle drops from 101.26±0.2° in pristine to 3.1±0.3° in the hydrothermally treated fibers. The moisture regain from 1.87±0.3% to 6.7±0.4% is observed after 24 h. The mineralization shows the hydroxyapatite NPs in all composites. The large zone of inhibition is observed in the composite, with the Ag NPs equal to 11.5±0.04 mm for Staphylococcus aureus and 18.91±0.02 mm for Escherichia coli . The increased proliferation of HEK 293T cells for 6 days of culture on composite scaffolds compared to the pristine scaffolds is achieved. The cell attachment examinations show successful attachment of cells on fibers and nuclear staining analysis shows the highest proliferation in scaffolds with an intermediate concentration of Ag NPs (10%). This strategy presents a novel improvisation for as‐spun PU fibers that can fabricate wound‐healing biomaterials for tissue engineering.",

TiO 2 @H‐CeO 2 with maximum surface/interface effect is chosen as the substrate and then reacts with different concentrations of Ce(NO 3 ) 3 ·6H 2 O solutions. Optical properties analysis shows that after the reaction, the band gap of the composite structure and the electron–hole recombination efficiency both decrease while the photodegradation ability is effectively improved. Spectroscopic and microscopic observations reveal two changes in the structure after the reaction. The first is the deposition of CeO 2 nanoparticles that can be observed inside and on the surface of the shell; the second is the doping of Ce 3+ in the TiO 2 nanoparticles of this shell. The deposition of CeO 2 particles increases the interfacial area between the CeO 2 and TiO 2 and facilitates the corresponding charge transfer. The Ce 3+ doping in the TiO 2 shell changes the optical properties of TiO 2 . Therefore, the improved performance of the composite structure can be attributed to the synergy of different surfaces and interfacial effects caused by the reactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lithium(Li) metal is an anode candidate for rechargeable batteries due to its ultra‐high theoretical capacity and extremely low standard potential. However, the dendritic Li and dead Li have hindered the practical application of next‐generation batteries. Constructing 3D anode current collectors can not only decrease the local current density but also relieve the volume expansion. Herein, the 3D Ni nano‐starfish@Al(NSA) is synthesized as anode current collectors. Compared with the 3D Ni nano‐cone@Al(NCA) with sharp cone tips, the NSA shows a superior cycle performance, especially at high current density. This is because the NSA has a more uniform surface curvature than NCA, which makes the electric field distribution more homogeneous and reduces the local electric field, thereby inducing the even deposition of Li and suppressing the growth of Li dendrites. The NSA@Li anode gives superior cycling performance over 2800 h at a current density of 4 mA cm −2 in a symmetric cell. A full cell paired with LiFePO 4 cathode shows high Coulombic efficiency of 96.8% approaching 200 cycle‐life at 0.5 °C. This work provides a view of the microstructure design of current collectors for achieving better performance Li metal batteries.",

The thermal paper undergoes UV‐induced topological chemical polymerization and further cross‐linking to form stably blue. Because of the reduced energy barrier, red thermal paper after thermal stimulation can undergo color reduction under UV light irradiation. Increasing the photopolymerization time from 5 s to 600 s leads to the rising of the color change temperature from approximately 76.4 °C to 105.4 °C.

However, composite electrodes consist of unevenly distributed active material, conductive additives, and polymeric binder, which complicates the electron/ion conduction path; hence, estimating the DOD‐dependent charge transfer resistance is difficult. However, micro‐sized spherical cathode active particles can be arranged into a cylindrical cavity trap on a microelectrode to evaluate the interfacial behavior of LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM811) cathode active particles in liquid and solid electrolyte systems. The electrochemical parameters calculated from the resultant Tafel plot can encourage meaningful discussions and demonstrate the reliability of the measurement technique.",

Paper‐based power supplies are indispensable to realize a fully papertronic paradigm and are a critical enabler of environmentally benign power solutions. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) hold great potential as power sources for such green papertronic applications. This work reports the design, operation, and optimization of a high‐power papertronic MFC by biosynthesizing microbe‐mediated tin oxide nanoparticles (SnO 2 NPs) on dormant Bacillus subtilis endospores. They form an electrical conduit that improves electron harvesting during the spore germination and power generation. The MFC is packaged in a sub‐microporous alginate to minimize the potential risk of bacteria leakage. Upon the introduction of water, the paper‐based MFC generates a significantly enhanced power density of 140 µW cm −2 , which is more than two orders of magnitude greater than their previously reported counterparts. Six MFCs connected in series generate more than sufficient power to run an on‐chip, light‐emitting diode.",

Using hyphenated pyrolysis (Py–GC–MS, TG‐IR) and characterization (CHNS, XPS, and Raman) techniques the phenomena associated with the incorporation of nitrogen in the biochars are unraveled. Co‐pyrolyzing SP and GL increased biochar yields and nitrogen retention, which is attributed to Maillard reactions occurring in the initial pyrolysis stages. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that co‐pyrolysis of microalgae and reducing sugars is a more sustainable strategy to produce algae‐based biochar.",

Photothermal membrane distillation (PMD), an emerging thermal‐driven process for seawater desalination, combines interfacial heating with membrane distillation (MD) technology to address the energy consumption issues of conventional MD. However, it is still a great challenge to develop a cost‐effective and scalable membrane, which hampers the practical use of PMD. Herein, a dual‐layer carbon black (CB)/PVDF membrane is prepared via direct electrospraying on a commercial PVDF membrane. With the introduction of a functional layer, a photothermal effect is imparted to the bare membrane, thus significantly increasing the water production rate and solar utilization efficiency (SUE) during exposure to artificial sunlight (≈57% enhancement and 72% SUE under 1 sun). In addition to the outstanding photothermal properties, this functional layer also served as a passivation coating to synergistically reduce the crystallization rate and physical binding of inorganic salts on the modified membrane without adding hazardous chemicals or using laborious steps. This multifunctional coated membrane and fast‐growing solar desalination technology provides a promising solution to the water crisis, especially in off‐grid areas where energy and resources are both relatively insufficient.",

Broadband and Selective Radiative Coolers (BRCs and SRCs, respectively) are the two main types of RCs that have been proposed for application in the built environment. Being both typically characterized by high solar reflectance, the former emits thermal radiation within the overall infrared spectrum, whilst the latter emits thermal radiation mainly within the Atmospheric Window (AW) waverange. A variety of both types of RCs have been developed and tested in both in‐lab and in‐field experimental campaigns. Yet, all experiments comprise small scale specimens that do not represent real‐life scale components of the built environment. In addition, no meso scale assessments have been performed with respect to the RCs' performance at a city scale. Here, for the first time, the thermo‐optical performance of both BRCs and SRCs is introduced and investigated in a multilayer Urban Canopy Model (UCM) coupled with extended Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) and we simulated 20 different scenarios representing the vast majority of urban layouts. The outcomes show that both types of RCs maintain lower surface temperature and air temperature at 2 m height inside the canyon, compared to conventional roofs. In addition, a city scale application of RCs has been found capable of decreasing ambient temperature up to 1.6°C as potentially experienced by pedestrians.",

Here, an efficient, nanoporous, heterogeneous benzoxazole catalyst is reported for aerobic oxidative coupling of amines. A molecular design strategy is presented to functionalize primary amines to produce valuable products under one‐pot, open‐air reaction conditions. Unprecedented and previously unknown, the stable imine intermediate catalyzes its own formation, also known as autocatalysis, enabling a direct and favorable access to amino acids, even if the catalysts are absent. The biomimetic benzoxazole catalysts developed here provide quantitative catalytic activity over 50 cycles with favorable kinetics with no degradation. This work also marks the first use of benzoxazoles for oxidative catalytic reactions.",

The functionalization is done via a chemical vapor deposition‐type method and leads to the quantitative reaction of isolated surface silanol groups of mesoporous silica materials with organosilane molecules. The result is a highly sulfonated material by anchorage of 3‐mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane molecules and subsequent oxidation of the thiol groups to sulfonic acid groups. Ordered mesoporous KIT‐6 and SBA‐15 are chosen as model systems. The sulfonated material exhibits a functionalization degree of 1.05 resp. 1.32 molecules nm −2 , which is on the maximum of the theoretical achievable functionalization density resulting in high ion exchange capacities of 1.22 and 1.12 mmol g −1 . The versatility and mildness of this method opens up functionalization possibilities for a wide range of other materials, which could be sulfonated or otherwise modified with silanes, and tailored for the further application in catalysis or as solid‐state proton conductors.",

For waste heat recovery, an innovative electrothermodynamic cycle (pyroelectric effect with an external electric field) was recently presented, which is based on temporal temperature variations in wasted heat from engine exhaust gas. Herein, for further improvement, a generating mechanism of the cycle is investigated via an Operando analysis, time‐resolved synchrotron X‐ray diffraction with generating assessment. Polarization changes are analyzed via simultaneous electrical and crystallographic studies. Three types of materials are prepared: soft and hard types of PZTs and lead magnesium niobate—lead titanate (PMN‐PT). Among them, PMN‐PT has the highest generating power. When an external electric field is applied, the PMN‐PT exhibits only 180° domain rotations, whereas the other materials exhibit both 90° and 180° rotations. A strong driving force for 180° rotation depresses rotations in other angles and increases polarization changes. The results show that the material development, which has only 180° switching domains, has potential for use in the establishment of a high‐efficiency waste heat recovery system.",

The sensors are based on the interaction of the evanescent field of the guided light with the functionalized mesoporous silica films. Upon absorption of metal ions, the resonant wavelengths of the microresonators shift due to the increased refractive index of the film. The sensors are exposed to aqueous solutions of Pb(II) ions at different concentrations and time‐resolved absorption–desorption curves are obtained. The concentrations of Pb(II) ions are determined using the Lorentz–Lorenz model. It is found that two distinct binding sites with different affinities for Pb(II) are present in the S 4 ‐MPS silica films, corresponding to tetrasulfide groups and, likely, silanol groups. The number of available binding sites corresponds to 1/25 of the total number of S 4 ‐groups. Equilibrium constants for absorption of Pb(II) to both binding sites are obtained from the rate constants for the absorption and desorption processes. The initial absorption rates depend linearly on the concentration of Pb(II) and are used to determine the 3σ limit of detection as 58 ppb m in deionized water and 350 ppb m in tap water.",

The n ‐Ni#MgO efficiently catalyzes reforming of the two major greenhouse gases, methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), in a low‐temperature range (&lt;600 °C). Moreover, it exhibits higher coking tolerance than conventional nickel‐based catalysts and can rival commercial precious metal catalysts in terms of both the reaction activity and coking tolerance. The characterization results demonstrate that the excellent catalytic performance of n ‐Ni#MgO is attributed to the basic MgO support and intertwined nanoporous network structure, which significantly enhances the CO 2 utilization and topologically stabilize the interface of Ni and MgO. This work also offers a crucial design for topologically tailoring metal‐oxide catalysts, to achieve a highly active yet long‐term stable metal‐oxide interface.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Employing a large dipole interlayer has recently been one of the most captivating interfacial engineering approaches in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, the effect of using green‐solvent processable molecules with large dipole moments as electron extraction layers (DM‐EELs) on OSCs’ stability is investigated. The inverted OSCs are based on two donor–acceptor systems, with histidine and sarcosine as representative DM‐EELs and with ZnO as a control EEL. Stability results illustrate that while the dominant degradation mechanism depends on the donor–acceptor system (photoinduced degradation vs temporal degradation), using DM‐EELs substantially suppresses degradation and enhances stability in both cases. The voltage‐dependent ideality factor characteristics show that the DM‐EEL OSCs exhibit minimal recombination mechanism changes even after UV exposure. By contrast, ZnO cells are limited by significant shunt formation and UV‐induced surface recombination. Low‐temperature measurements verify that unlike the indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO contact, the ITO/DM‐EEL contact is not affected by trap states or work function variations. As a result, the ITO/DM‐EEL contact maintains its electron‐selectivity and resists UV‐induced surface recombination observed in the ZnO cells. The results show that using green‐solvent processable materials with large dipole moments as EELs can provide a universal route for enhancing the stability of inverted OSCs.",

Nevertheless, while achieving sustainable products, all related risks associated with sustainability should be considered. Previous studies are limited by the lack of the dynamic and multidimensional approaches. However, as the decision‐making environment is constantly changing in the real world, a dynamic decision‐making approach is required. The aim of this study is to develop a dynamic and risk‐driven approach to investigate the product sustainability risks. The proposed approach considers all the related risks and interactions with a holistic view covering environmental, economic, and social sustainability. To deal with the dynamic and multidimensional nature of product sustainability, system dynamics is proposed. The results show that increasing the production capacity of the company and maintaining the production emphasizing innovation have led to improvements on both product sustainability and the main dimensions of sustainability. The realization of Industry I4.0 applications can be an effective strategy for the business to increase product sustainability. This study is supported with a case study implemented in the manufacturing industry to confirm the applicability of the model. This paper is useful for industry and policy makers to observe the potentials impacts of products sustainability risks.",

After a 60 min mechanochemical pretreatment followed by enzyme hydrolysis at 50 °C, 62% of the available carbohydrate can be recovered as fermentable sugars, primarily in the form of glucose and xylose. Structural and chemical analysis finds that mechanochemical pretreatment increases accessible surface area and amorphizes the crystalline cellulose present in bamboo, both of which increase reactivity. The experimental results are then used for a systems‐level analysis of ethanol production in Nigeria. The energy required for mechanochemical pretreatment is estimated to be 0.5–5.6 MJ per kg of bamboo; this energy can be provided by solar power, while still satisfying existing needs for stationary power. Ethanol production on marginal land alone is projected to be sufficient to replace nearly 80% of Nigeria's current gasoline usage while reserving sufficient land area for solar power generation to meet current electricity needs, meaning that bamboo cultivation followed by mechanochemical pretreatment can play an important role for utilizing locally available resources without generation of new chemical wastes.",

It is useful due to the vast scales involved as a source of fuels, chemicals, and functional materials when suitable postprocessing is applied. It is deemed to be a renewable alternative to fossil sources. Because of the extreme complexity of kraft lignin, in‐depth composition analysis and chemical structural identification are crucial for the development of effective valorization strategies. This work embarks on the characterization and identification of lignin‐derived phenolic compounds in representative hardwood ( Eucalyptus ) kraft lignin after selective fractionation using a single solvent. Advanced 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 31 P NMR, and mass spectrometry in combination with synthetic authentic compounds are used for the structural identification of the low‐molecular‐weight fraction of kraft lignin. A total of 20 phenolic compounds, including several novel monomers (catechols), dimers (diarylethanes, diarylethenes, etc.), and trimers with triphenyl structures are systematically identified in the Eucalyptus kraft lignin. In addition, polysulfide is detected in the low‐molecular‐weight fraction, indicating that the oxidative polymerization of S 2− /HS − occurrs during the kraft pulping process. An improved understanding of kraft lignin, especially the low‐Mw fraction, is expected to provide essential information for the selective fractionation and valorization of lignin.",

However, carbonate is commonly regarded as a poor matrix to host photocatalytic active species, and current literature has few reports of carbonate‐based photocatalytic material. Herein, a hierarchically porous catalyst that features ≈5 nm deficient NiCO 3 nanoparticles embedded in sponge‐like high‐magnesium calcite is disclosed. In the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction, the as‐prepared catalyst of low Ni content attains a high CO production rate of 10 565 µmol g −1 h −1 and a high selectivity of 94% relative to H 2 evolution, a performance that surpasses many other state‐of‐the‐art nickel‐based catalysts. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the carbonate vacancy of NiCO 3 strengthens the adsorption and activation of CO 2 more significantly than the corresponding oxygen vacancy of NiO. The inert CO 2 molecule becomes highly deformed on the surface of NiCO 3 which can be readily activated to the key intermediate CO 2 ·− for the photoreduction reaction. The present findings add to the existing knowledge of advanced catalysis using defect materials and demonstrate an intriguing and rare case of highly performing carbonate‐based catalyst.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hierarchical nanostructures have attracted considerable research attention due to their applications in the catalysis field. Herein, we design a versatile hierarchical nanostructure composed of NiMoO 4 nanorods surrounded by active MoS 2 nanosheets on an interconnected nickel foam substrate. The as‐prepared nanostructure exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance, producing a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of 90 mV, in comparison with 220 mV necessary to reach a similar current density for NiMoO 4 . This behavior originates from the structural/morphological properties of the MoS 2 nanosheets, which present numerous surface‐active sites and allow good contact with the electrolyte. Besides, the structures can effectively store charges, due to their unique branched network providing accessible active surface area, which facilitates intermediates adsorptions. Particularly, NiMoO 4 /MoS 2 shows a charge capacity of 358 mAhg −1 at a current of 0.5 A g −1 (230 mAhg −1 for NiMoO 4 ), thus suggesting promising applications for charge‐storing devices.",

The waste carbon product as a form of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) is incorporated within a conjugate polymer, namely, polyaniline (PANI) to produce CNP‐PANI composites that have shown excitation‐wavelength‐independent triple‐band photoluminescence emission effect and highly sensitive Fe +3 ion detection ability. Herein the waste carbon material, while functionalized within the conjugated polymer, needs no further acid treatment or surface modification thus making the process cheaper, environmentally benign, and useful for green nanotechnology. The excitation‐wavelength‐independent unique triple‐band photoluminescence spectrum is the direct consequence of carbon–polyaniline synergy in π–π transition and the surface passivation of CNPs by the NH 2 group rich aniline during in‐situ polymerization. The current scenario has been studied for the samples prepared with different CNP concentrations for different reaction times and discussed in details with supportive physico‐chemical characterizations. Moreover, the present study has demonstrated that the current material can be used as a fluorescent sensing platform for Fe +3 ions with high sensitivity and selectivity criteria where the detection limit of the sensing probe has a value as low as 12 × 10 −9 nM.",

However, their incorporation and fabrication into prototypic devices remain challenging due to their limited ability to form hierarchical 3D structures through the use of large scale, low cost, and facile processes. Herein, this challenge is addressed and the growth of unique hierarchical structures is demonstrated by coating calcareous foraminiferal shells with metal oxide materials via simple and inexpensive processes conducted on a large scale. Foraminifera are highly diverse and abundant marine unicellular protists surrounded by large, ranging from 0.1 mm to more than 200 mm in size, identical porous, and complex hierarchical shells. In the present study, these hierarchal structures are investigated in electrochemical water oxidation reactions and tested in terms of their ability to purify water from inorganic (metal ions) contaminates. The remarkable performances of the prototype filters and catalysts developed here, among the best recorded values in both fields, are reported. These findings thus open new perspectives for catalytic and water purification applications.",

These systems are highly promising to produce H 2 without carbon emissions, however, their fabrication is still based on expensive fabrication procedures and nonabundant materials, which prevents their manufacturing and study by many laboratories. Here, an original concept for preparing monolithic water‐splitting PECs based on the integration of a low‐cost Si photovoltaic (PV) panel with two Si‐based photoelectrodes fabricated by simple procedures and earth‐abundant materials is demonstrated. In contrast with previous approaches, in the present system, the PV solid junction and the two solid/liquid junctions participate in the creation of the effective photovoltage applied for water splitting. This simple device that can split water from various electrolytes for several hours should promote new advances in the field of solar fuels.",

Recently, porous metal oxide/semiconductor junctions have shown that flat‐band potentials ( V fb ), representing interface energetics, could be dynamically changed with PEC reactions. However, it remains unclear as to what structural and physical specificities of the porous metal oxide induce the dynamic V fb . Herein, it is demonstrated that the electrolyte permeability and nanocrystal structure of porous NiO x are crucial for the dynamic V fb in porous NiO x integrated Si photocathodes. A comparison of the dense and porous NiO x with electrolyte impermeable and permeable features, respectively, shows that V fb changes only in the porous NiO x . The porous NiO x also exhibits a nanocrystal structure and increased V fb values with a decrease in nanocrystal size. As a result of the increased V fb , the porous NiO x achieves much higher PEC performance compared to that of the dense NiO x . However, electrolyte permeability causes electrochemical decomposition of the Si component. Thus, a cointegration of the porous and dense NiO x bilayers, which ensures stable PEC operation for 10 h while achieving high potentials of 0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a photocurrent of 10 mA cm −2 , is proposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For improving the performance of platinum electrocatalysts in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), it is important to enhance the Pt utilization level in the catalyst systems. A high performing electrocatalyst (Pt/3DNG) is developed for PEMFC applications by using nitrogen‐doped 3D graphene (3DNG) as the support material and an in situ grafted active “triple‐phase boundary” to more precisely control the formation of the proton conducting ionomer interface at the active sites. Considering the 3D morphology of the system, during the electrode fabrication for realistic single‐cell evaluation, the concept of in situ generation of the proton conducting‐ionomer based “active triple‐phase boundary” is introduced, which could potentially replace the conventional method of using Nafion ionomer for the electrode preparation. The monomers owing to their small‐size can access the pores and inner regions of the 3DNG support, which on UV‐curing, undergo polymerization and transform into an ionomer with an extended interfacial network into the nanoregimes of 3DNG. Single cell evaluation of the membrane electrode assembly in a high‐temperature PEMFC by using phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membrane demonstrates the utility of the present strategy.",

A solar vapor generator uses sunlight to transform a liquid stream into a vapor stream to operate a turbine for generating electricity. For efficient vapor generation, it should absorb the sunlight in broad spectrum with high absorption, and also have high photothermal conversion efficiency. In this work, Ni nanowires and Au/Ni core–shell nanowire absorbers which meet the relevant conditions are fabricated using a cost‐effective process for efficient solar vapor generation. The light is scattered and trapped in the nanowires and the electrical field is enhanced between the nanowires by the surface plasmonic gap resonance, resulting in high absorption. Also, the adiabatic nanofocusing structure generates heat at hot spots, resulting in efficient photothermal conversion. As a result, the Ni and Au/Ni core–shell nanowire absorbers respectively, absorb over 98% and 91% of the incident light in the solar spectrum. Further, the efficiency of photothermal conversion of the Au–Ni absorber under 1 Sun is found to be ≈33%. These absorbers have the potential to be applied to diverse fields, such as desalination, solar thermophotovoltaics, and metamaterials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Water disinfection is a crucial challenge for humanity. Approaches that are effective, cheap, environmentally friendly, and do not promote gene exchange between bacteria are urgently required. Strongly oxidizing radicals are highly promising to achieve this as they lead to bacterial activation at high efficiencies. However, sources to consistently generate these radicals are limited to high energy UV/H 2 O 2 treatments requiring a large energy input. Here the use of abundant, cheap, brownmillerite (Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5 ) is demonstrated as an efficient radical generation material under dark conditions, showing a seven order of magnitude decrease in bacterial concentration over 10 min. This decrease is attributed to the release of interlayer Ca 2+ from the layered structure of Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5 and hydroxyl radical generation. The efficacy of Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5 is demonstrated by disinfecting turbid sewage sludge. The identification of this cheap, abundant, and nontoxic antibacterial material will provide an opportunity for broad scale clean water generation globally, and address the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of clean water and sanitation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Back contacts, as an important part of solar cell devices, play a critical role in efficient separation of carriers and reduction of interfacial recombination. Here, by analyzing interfacial band alignment, thickness and defect properties of back contacts, a design principle for back contacts is proposed to properly accommodate the interrelated factors of short‐circuit current ( J sc ), open‐circuit voltage ( V oc ), series resistance ( R s ), and nonradiative recombination centers (NRCs) at the same time. A preferred back contact should have (i) a high valance band maximum (VBM) and (ii) a low Fermi level relative to absorber to drive hole extraction and block electron leakage, (iii) a thin design under the premise of p + ‐type characteristic to effectively reduce R s , which also ensures a wide depletion region on the absorber side to promote hole collection, and (iv) no additional deep‐level defects as interfacial NRCs. Taking molybdenum chalcogenide as example, p + ‐type MoSe 2 /MoS 2 realized by group VB element doping satisfies the design principles and is promising as an excellent back contact for kesterite/perovskite solar cells. This study gives theoretical guidance for designing an ideal back contact and shows how to improve the photovoltaic performance of solar cells by interfacial optimization.",

In this work, periodic density functional theory calculations are applied to investigate, for the first time, the possibility of activating the inert basal surfaces of 2H‐MoTe 2 monolayers by N‐ or P‐doping for overall electrocatalytic water splitting. The results show that both N‐ and P‐doping significantly change the surface charge distribution and electronic band structure of 2H‐MoTe 2 . In addition, the doping‐induced structural disorder generates more active sites, leading to improved electrochemical activities for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Especially, N‐doped 2H‐MoTe 2 (4 × 4 × 1) exhibits a better OER catalytic performance with a small overpotential of 1.82 eV (vs normal hydrogen electrode), while both N‐ and P‐doped MoTe 2 monolayers exhibit outstanding HER catalytic performance with a Gibbs free energy of the hydrogen adsorption ( for N‐doped MoTe 2 and for P‐doped MoTe 2 ) smaller than that of pristine 2H‐MoTe 2 (). The study provides an effective strategy for regulating the electroactivity of layered transition metal dichalcogenides for enhanced overall water splitting.",

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and short cycle life have critically hindered their commercialization. Herein, a stepped porous heterostructured membrane of carbon‐multilayer graphene (MG)@Fe 3 C/Fe 3 N is developed by a facile phase inversion method and applied as a current collector to replace Al foil. The special heterostructured membrane with MG can further boost the charge/Li + ion transfer speed while accommodating the volume expansion in the charge/discharge cycle. The shuttle effect of polysulfides is inhibited by the heterostructure phase of the Fe 3 C/Fe 3 N catalytic effect and chemisorption. This synergistic effect is confirmed by density function theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, the C‐MG@Fe 3 C/Fe 3 N membranes delivers distinguished discharge capacity and cycling stability of 508.92 mAh g −1 (693.47 mAh g −1 ) at a large discharge of current of 2 C (at 0.5 C) after 400 cycles (300 cycles) with only 0.36% capacity attenuation per cycle.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Structural defect‐endowed photocatalysts are being increasingly recognized due to the enhanced catalytic activity of multiple defect sites (e.g., vacancies or functional groups). However, because of the excessive destruction effect of conventional chemical oxidation methods toward carboxyl defects engineering, the mechanism is still unclear and practice is rare in developing high‐quality structural carboxyl defect‐involved g‐C 3 N 4 . Herein, an alternating hydrogen‐oxygen‐plasma treatment is proposed to endow the g‐C 3 N 4 with enriched vacancy defect sites for the subsequent immobilization of carboxyl groups, thus overcoming the problem of lacking of covalent binding sites in g‐C 3 N 4 in developing carboxyl defective g‐C 3 N 4 photocatalysts. The alternating hydrogen‐oxygen‐plasma treatment does not only influence the defect structure of g‐C 3 N 4 , but also changes its morphology, optimizes the electronic distribution, and increases the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby increasing photocatalytic H 2 evolution by 7.91 times. Density functional calculations and electrochemical characterization suggest that the carboxyl defects generated by the fast H 2 ‐O 2 plasma modification lead to a local asymmetric electron environment, which enhances carrier separation capability and significantly improves H 2 generation activity. This study provides a new insight into the rational design and fabrication of defect‐containing photocatalysts, carbon materials, and polymers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biofilm bioreactors are attracting growing interest in the wastewater industry, as they allow higher cell densities and thus higher reaction rates compared to conventional bioreactors. However, some commonly used nitrifying bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas europaea , are slow‐growing and need a prolonged period of time to develop a mature biofilm. Here, a biocoating or “living paint” is introduced, which is a synthetic biofilm made from a colloidal polymer (synthetic latex) binder encapsulating viable nitrifying bacteria at high density. Conventionally, the film formation of biocoatings is achieved by drying a bacteria/latex mixture. However, this fabrication is detrimental to the viability of the encapsulated bacteria because of the osmotic stress induced by desiccation. A nondesiccating film formation process is presented for biocoatings, which exploits two colloid science phenomena: coagulation and wet sintering. Desiccation‐sensitive, nitrifying bacteria are employed in the biocoatings to convert NH 4 + to NO 2 − and then NO 3 − . These biocoatings have a conversion rate (NO 2 − and NO 3 − production) of 3 mg N g −1 d −1 that is five times higher than in conventionally desiccated biocoatings. The reactivity continues over a period of 1 month. The processing method for these living paints is transformative for wastewater treatment and other applications using delicate, desiccation‐sensitive microorganisms.",

The model includes inter‐ and intramolecular transesterification and random chain scission, considering the single site activity of the studied catalyst class, based upon the “asme”‐ligand already established in lactide ROP. This allows for the description of reaction rate constants and the prediction of conversion as well as molar mass and dispersity of the obtained polymer. It is further shown that the model can be applied to describe the same characteristics for the faster, next generation catalysts based on the archetype “asme” catalyst. This lays the foundation for a faster catalyst design, targeting the needs of industry in developing fast and nontoxic alternatives for the industrially used toxic ROP catalyst Sn octanoate, bridging the gap between academia and industry.",

    "abstract": "With the fast development of the social economy and the improvement of people's living standards, energy and environmental issues are attracting more and more attention. In the future, the great challenge for mankind is to shift energy supply from fossil energy to renewable energy. Solar energy is the most important renewable energy on Earth. However, low energy density and intermittency limit its practical application. Photocatalysis has broad application prospects in solar energy utilization. Photocatalysis can utilize solar energy to decompose water to produce hydrogen, reduce carbon dioxide to synthesize solar fuel, and degrade pollutants to purify the environment. However, the low photocatalytic efficiency limits its practical application. Thus, from the viewpoint of practical utilization, the improvement in methods and new photocatalysts are highly required. A total of 16 papers have been published in this issue, covering H2 production, CO2 reduction, H2O2 synthesis, and pollutant degradation. Among them, there are 10 papers about hydrogen production and 6 papers related to S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts. We would like to express our sincere thanks to all the authors who submitted their interesting works to this special issue. A summary of all 18 accepted papers is provided as follows. Firstly, in article number 2200394, the authors present different functional ligands or metals incorporated into the parent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to enhance the photocatalytic performance of multivariate MOFs. The synthesis methods and unique advantages of multivariate MOFs-based photocatalysts are discussed. The recent advance in three multivariate MOFs for solar-to-chemical energy conversion are summarized according to mixed-metal MOFs, mixed-metal and mixed-ligand MOFs, and mixed-ligand MOFs. Finally, future perspectives and challenges in CO2 conversion and H2 evolution over Multivariate MOFs-based photocatalysts are discussed. In article number 2200364, Liu and colleagues reported enhanced CO2 photoreduction over Ni(OH)2-x/WO3 nanofibers, which were prepared by in situ growth of freestanding oxygen-vacancy Ni(OH)2-x nanosheets on WO3 nanofibers. The Ni(OH)2-x/WO3 nanofibers exhibit an enhanced CO production rate with respect to WO3 (54.4 vs 8.1 µmol g−1 h−1). The 13CO2 isotope tracing experiment confirmed that the CO product originated from the input CO2. The article with number 2200189 presents n-type CoP2 semiconductors as one of the main active components for efficient hydrogen evolution obtained from bulk P-CoV-LDH (layered double hydroxide). To achieve oriented control of carrier migration, the ZnxCd1−xS solid solution is effectively combined with P-CoV-LDH to synthesize a highly efficient and stable S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst. The best P-CoV-LDH/ZnxCd1−xS 30% composite has a hydrogen evolution rate of 1244.3 µmol without noble metal additives, which is 6.4 times more than ZnxCd1−xS. Li and co-workers, in article number 2200143, reported g-C3N4 with edge grafting of 4-(1H-imidazol-2-yl) benzoic acid and NiS cocatalysts fabricated via a one-pot chemical condensation of monomers with urea and subsequent photodeposition. The obtained composites exhibit greatly enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution, in comparison with the undoped g-C3N4. The synergistic effect of bimetallic sulfide is discussed in article number 2200139, which reports the composite bimetallic sulfide ZnCo2S4 and CdS with excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution capability. The synergistic effect of zinc ions and cobalt ions enriches the redox-active sites, which provides favorable conditions for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The synergistic effect of bimetallic ions as the main driving force for the accelerated hydrogen precipitation reaction is analyzed by fluorescence and electrochemical characterization. The results of hydrogen production experiments show that the hydrogen evolution amount of ZnCo2S4/CdS is about 10 times that of single CdS. Article number 2200134 describes carbon nanotubes in situ grown onto g-C3N4 nanosheets via a chemical vapor deposition process, catalyzed by Au nanoparticles pre-deposited on g-C3N4 surface via deposition-precipitation. Systematic characterizations, in particular femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, prove that carbon nanotubes can efficiently extract the localized electrons in the tri-s-triazine units of g-C3N4, thereby enhancing charge carrier diffusion and separation. In article number 2200130, a donor–acceptor modified g-C3N4 conjugated copolymer is fabricated via facile thermal copolymerization of 2-aminobenzimidazole (abIM) and urea. The experimental results demonstrate that the abIM units are successfully incorporated into the framework of g-C3N4 and the main chemical structure of g-C3N4 is still preserved. These abIM units can serve as electron acceptors, extending the π-conjugated system and inducing the intramolecular charge transfer via an internal electric field. As a result, the construction of D–A structure not only improves the optical utilization efficiency but also facilitates the intramolecular migration of electrons and holes, leading to enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (2566 µmol g−1 h−1) as compared to pristine g-C3N4. Article number 2200113 presents a novel S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst g-C3N4/PDA comprised of ultrathin g-C3N4 and polydopamine (PDA) constructed by in situ self-polymerization. The optimal photocatalyst presents an excellent H2O2 production rate of 3801.25 µmol g−1 h−1 under light irradiation, which is about 2 and 11 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 and PDA, respectively, and exceeds most of the reported C3N4-based photocatalysts. The improvement of photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the synergistic effect of improved light absorption and promoted charge separation and transfer induced by the S-scheme heterojunction. In article number 2200030, a novel quaternary CdIn2S4-xSex solid-solution nanocrystal photocatalyst was prepared by one-step hydrothermal synthesis. The bandgap structure of CdIn2S4-xSex nanocrystals can be adjusted from 2.42 to 1.87 eV by varying the molar ratio of Se/S. Compared with pure CdIn2S4, the CdIn2S4-xSex solid-solution photocatalyst clearly represents excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, while the CdIn2S4-xSex (x = 0.4) solid-solution nanocrystal exhibits the optimal hydrogen-production efficiency of 314.24 µmol h−1, which is 3.3 times superior to that of CdIn2S4 (94.83 µmol h−1). In article number 2200027, ZnS/TiO2 S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts were constructed by in situ depositing ZnS nanoparticles on TiO2 nanofibers via hydrothermal method. A highly improved photocatalytic H2 evolution rate is achieved for the ZnS/TiO2 heterojunction as compared to the mono-component ZnS and TiO2. Remarkably, the TiO2/ZnS-5 sample possesses the highest H2 evolution rate of 5503.8 µmol g–1 h–1, which is 4.8 times of ZnS and 38.8 times of TiO2, respectively. In article number 2200009, highly dispersed Ni sites are planted on C3N5, an N-rich carbon nitride, by a facial two-step annealing method to construct a Ni-C3N5 material. The incorporation of Ni sites can significantly enhance the e–/h+ separation efficiency of C3N5 under light irradiation and promote the activation of O2 to produce reactive oxygen species. Compared with pristine C3N5 (with NO removal ratio of ≈35%), the as-prepared 0.1- or 0.25-Ni-C3N5 material can remove ≈54% continuous-flowing NO (initial concentration: 600 ppb) quickly in less than 25 min under white LED light irradiation. A novel sandwich-like hierarchical heterostructure of Ti3C2 MXene/WO3 is created by in situ growth of ultrathin WO3 nanosheets onto the surface of few-layer Ti3C2 nanosheets via a one-pot solvothermal synthesis strategy (article number 2100507). The resultant Ti3C2/WO3 heterostructure holds a large interface contact area, an intimate electronic interaction, and a short carrier migration distance, which is beneficial for bulk-to-surface and interfacial charge transfer. As expected, the as-prepared Ti3C2/WO3 nanohybrids exhibit superior visible-light-driven photoactivity and stability toward tetracycline hydrochloride decomposition. Article number 2100498 presents an S-scheme of Mn0.2Cd0.8S-diethylenetriamine/porous g-C3N4 heterojunction designed, which accelerates the charge transfer at the interface of Mn0.2Cd0.8S-diethylenetriamine and porous g-C3N4, and provides electrons for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Under the same light conditions, the hydrogen production efficiency of the composite is 11.42 mmol h–1 g–1, which is 30 times higher than that of porous g-C3N4. The paper \"Porous Zn conformal coating on dendritic-like Ag with enhanced selectivity and stability for CO2 electroreduction to CO\" (article number 2200374) presents uniform porous Zn conformal coating on high-curvature dendritic Ag nanoneedles by vacuum thermal evaporation. As the surface sacrificial shell, the dissolution and reconstruction of Zn protect the inner Ag core, thus enhancing the CO2 reduction stability of the composited samples. In article number 2200402, a step-scheme heterojunction consisting of thin TiO2 nanosheets and few-layered MoO3 structures is reported. With a decoration of a low dose of MoO3 layer by ball milling method, TiO2 shows a 3-fold increase in the hydrogen evolution rate. The presence of MoO3 promotes the electron-hole pair separation via the Step-scheme mechanism. Finally, in article number 2200381, a novel MOFs-derived In2O3/ZnO tubular S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction is reported. Because of Fermi level difference and electron transfer, an internal electric field is produced at In2O3/ZnO heterojunction interfaces, which results in the formation of S-scheme heterojunctions. The CO2 photoreduction follows a *COOH-intermediate mechanism and the CO production rate (12.6 µmol g−1) with nearly 100% selectivity is obtained over In2O3/ZnO S-scheme photocatalyst.

    "abstract": "Abstract Depleting fossil fuels and greenhouse emissions render hydrogen (H) a promising alternative for powering automobiles. MgH 2 with its promising H‐weight capacity ≈7.6 wt% can be used for this purpose. However, it exhibits long incubation times with no significant H‐release during the early stages. The present Mg–B–reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites can reduce such incubation time drastically. Herein, Mg, rGO, and elemental B as a light weight catalyst at various proportions (viz. B / C (from rGO) weight ratios of 0, 0.09, 0.22, 0.36, and 0.90) are used to synthesize Mg–B–rGO nanocomposites by ball milling. They are eventually subjected to hydrogen uptake at ≈320 °C and P H2 ≈ 15 bar followed by H‐release in vacuum. The nanocomposite with B / C ≈ 0.22 exhibits remarkably negligible incubation time (≈43 s) vis‐à‐vis ≈11 min by B / C = 0. This B / C ≈ 0.22 nanocomposite experiences charge (electron) transfer from Mg and B to C, located external to MgH 2 unit cell. This causes Mg←H→B “Tug‐of‐war” within MgH 2 unit cell, containing B in its interstitials (due to ball milling) and shrinking it. This leads to “structural catalysis” of H‐release, understood by X‐ray photoelectron, valence band, Raman spectra, and novel electron density maps. These novel materials can alleviate the need for activation cycles for their application.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in systems for sustainable production of hydrogen and other fuels. Catalytic OER materials often undergo potential‐induced redox transitions localized at metal sites. For volume‐active catalyst‐materials, these are necessarily coupled to charge‐compensating relocation of ions entering or leaving the material, which is insufficiently understood. The binding mode and mechanistic role of redox‐inert ions for a cobalt‐based oxyhydroxide material (CoCat) when operated at neutral pH in potassium‐phosphate (KPi) electrolyte are investigated by i) determination of K:Co and P:Co stoichiometries for various KPi‐concentrations and electrode potentials, ii) operando X‐ray spectroscopy at the potassium and cobalt K‐edges, and iii) novel time‐resolved X‐ray experiments facilitating comparison of K‐release and Co‐oxidation kinetics. Potassium likely binds non‐specifically within water layers interfacing Co‐oxyhydoxide fragments involving potassium–phosphate ion pairs. The potassium‐release kinetics are potential‐independent with a fast‐phase time‐constant of about 5 s and thus clearly slower than the potential‐induced Co oxidation of about 300 ms. It is concluded that the charge‐compensating ion flow is realized neither by potassium nor by phosphate ions, but by protons. The results reported here are likely relevant also for a broader class of volume‐active OER catalyst materials and for the amorphized near‐surface regions of microcrystalline materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Energy harvesting from water flow or evaporation is recently reported exploiting carbon‐based materials. The water‐carbon dualism is at the base of this phenomenon thanks to a charge redistribution at the liquid/solid interface. Many kinds of approaches and nanomaterials are proposed for this purpose. The main properties under investigation are the surface functionalization and the porosity of carbon‐based materials. In this context, the exploitation of a stacked graphene oxide (GO) membrane as layered nanochannels for water flow energy harvesting is proposed. At the best of this study's knowledge, GO membranes are never reported for this application. The flow is spontaneously induced by both capillarity and evaporation when part of the membrane is incubated in water. In this study, zero‐energy is externally provided allowing sustainable energy production without sub‐products. Different GO membranes are tested for this purpose reaching a maximum open circuit voltage of ≈450 mV and maximum current of ≈100 nA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract CuBi 2 O 4 (CBO) has received considerable attention owing to its ideal optical bandgap and positive photocurrent onset potential. However, CBO photocathodes exhibit poor charge carrier separation and transfer across the conducting substrate interface. Herein, a systematic incorporation of Ag + ‐cations into nanosized porous CBO network (ACBO) using a simple pulsed‐electrodeposition method. In ACBO photocathode, the Ag + ‐ions replace the Bi 3+ ‐ions, thereby building an increased hole concentration, which further signifies the photogenerated electron‐hole separation. Additionally, introducing a low‐cost NiO hole‐selective layer between ACBO and the conducting substrate enables a back‐interface‐aided hole‐extraction and electron blocking, resulting in an improved charge transfer across the back interface. Compared with an unmodified CBO, the NiO/ACBO photocathode exhibits a three‐fold enhanced photocurrent performance. This enhances the photocurrent originating from the incorporation of a substantial amount of Ag + ‐ions into the CBO structure, leading to an increased acceptor density as well as the formation of an appropriate hole‐selective layer across the back‐contact. The absorption percentage, time‐resolved photoluminescence, and photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements unveil the potential light harvesting, charge separation, and transfer characteristics of the NACBO photoelectrode, respectively. Through this systematic study, an efficient and simple strategy is determined for developing ternary metal oxide‐based photocathode/photoanode systems for sustainable energy applications.",

Therefore, effective wastewater remediation approaches, which can be implemented on a large scale, are urgently required. This study aims at preparing a sustainable organic/inorganic composite material that can photo‐catalyze the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater by using visible light. Specifically, films and porous composites are composed of poly(3‐hydroxybutyrate‐ co ‐3‐hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) as supporting material, and copper sulfide (CuS) as active photocatalyst. It is noteworthy that the proposed composite can be fully produced from waste valorization, since PHBV is a polymer, which can be obtained by fermentation of vegetable wastes, and CuS is synthesized from industrial sulfur wastes. The produced composites show remarkable capabilities in the photodegradation of tetracycline and methylene blue, selected as model organic pollutants. Moreover, the PHBV/CuS composites can be reused multiple times with minimal loss in photocatalytic efficiency. The suggested approach is not only sustainable and cost‐effective, but also solves issues occurring in the application of the photodegradation techniques currently reported, such as the consumption of fossil‐based chemicals and photocatalyst removal from the purified water using with expensive procedures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aqueous rechargeable Zn‐metal batteries (AZMBs) are promising energy storage aids due to their inherent safety, low cost, and competent performance, with prospects in stationary and portable applications. In this regard, one of the critical requirements is developing electrodes that can adapt to mechanical deformation without compromising the charge storage performance. The current work demonstrates the development of a binder‐free and mechanically flexible composite cathode film (VP/fCNT‐F, where ‘F’ stands for the film) based on VOPO 4 (VP) and functionalized carbon nanotubes (fCNTs). The VP/fCNT‐F film processing involves simple vacuum filtration of the composite obtained from the in‐situ reaction of the fCNTs and the VP precursor in an aqueous medium. The functionalization of carbon nanotube (CNT) is important for the homogenous dispersion of VP and fCNT. The VP/fCNT‐F electrode is used as a monolithic electrode in AZMB cells in combination with both liquid and quasi‐solid‐state gel polymer electrolytes. Besides, the utility of the VP/fCNT‐F electrode in a flexible battery configuration is also demonstrated. Interestingly, in both the coin‐cell and flexible configurations, the VP/fCNT‐F electrode delivers a comparable discharge capacity of 90 and 78 mAh g −1 , respectively (at 0.1 A g −1 ), validating the advantage of the binder‐free VP/fCNT‐F electrode for AZMBs.",

The influence of the reaction conditions on the selectivity of methanol oxidation to formaldehyde is studied using a heated flat‐plate flow photoreactor illuminated by an LED array (λ max = 368 nm) and Pt‐modified SrTiO 3 . A combination of online analytical methods allowed to quantify all gaseous products during extended time‐on‐stream (&gt; 48 h TOS). The selectivity to formaldehyde is found to be primarily determined by the residence time and the process temperature. At a low methanol to water ratio, methanol conversion and evolution of CO 2 are favored, whereas the light intensity primarily influenced the apparent quantum yield from 5.1 to 1.8% at 9.36 to 52.93 mW cm −2 , respectively, and the methanol conversion thus determining the economic efficiency of the process. Operation temperatures higher than 110 °C resulted in a strong deactivation of the catalyst while simultaneously the formation of CO at the expense of formaldehyde selectivity is favored. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding the influence of relevant reaction conditions and the potential of selective photocatalytic gas‐phase oxidation of small molecules.",

Recently, the valorization of α‐pinene (readily/naturally available terpenic compounds) has been explored to prepare a wide range of processes to access perfumery products and remains fast‐growing research for industrial and societal applications.

Extensive research is employed using diverse catalytic approaches to utilize α‐pinene to prepare important perfumery intermediates.

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of sustainable valorization methods for lignin is a challenging task because the vast majority of the reported studies involve either harsh conditions or expensive transition metal catalysts. Inspired by the sunlight degradation of lignin compounds, known as lignin yellowing, the use of a commercially available cheap organic photoinitiator, namely, phenacyl bromide (PAB) is reported here, for the efficient cleavage of lignin model compound 2‐phenoxyacetophenone (2‐PAP) and for the depolymerization of soda pulped lignin (SL) under UV‐A irradiation and ambient conditions. Real‐time NMR investigations of the photoreaction between 2‐PAP and PAB shed light on the possible reaction mechanisms involving different radical species, HBr, and molecular oxygen. Interestingly, combined spectral, chromatographic, powder X‐ray diffraction, and thermal studies of the photoreaction between PAB and SL indicate the formation of guaiacyl alcohol as the main product. The unprecedented performance of PAB is attributed to the excess generation of phenacyl radicals, the generation of photolabile brominated species, and HBr playing key roles in the cleavage of β‐O‐4 linkages. This work represents a new edge for sustainable lignin valorization under mild reaction conditions and offers the opportunity for large‐scale production of valuable aromatics using technical lignins as feedstock.",

The results highlight two main circularity dimensions—sustainability and productivity—and three distinct circular economy profiles—optimizers, sustainables, and laggards. Findings suggest that while the European gap in terms of circularity is narrowing regarding productivity, it appears to be widening concerning sustainability. Furthermore, countries have yet to strike a balance between the sustainability and productivity dimensions, meaning additional efforts should be made to achieve more homogeneous progress.",

To resolve this issue, spent LiB anodes are customized into high‐performance supercapacitor (SC) electrodes via supercritical water exfoliation. The specific capacitance of spent LiB anodes (289 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 ) significantly improved after exfoliation (351 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 ). Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of the exfoliated LiB anode mushroomed upon the addition of dopamine (as a redox‐additive for the first time) with a conventional H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the exfoliated LiB anode is incredibly improved after the addition of dopamine with H 2 SO 4 , from 286 to 571 F g −1 at 4 A g −1 . A flexible SC is also fabricated using PVA/H 2 SO 4 and dopamine/PVA/H 2 SO 4 as the gel electrolyte.

The increased specific capacitance and energy density of the SC after the addition of dopamine with H 2 SO 4 and PVA/H 2 SO 4 may be due to the reversible reaction of dopamine to dopamine‐o‐quinone with H + ions.",

The main objective of developing dual‐responsive smart window materials lies in enhancing building applications and optimizing energy efficiency.

This study introduces a new methodology that uses a phase‐changing material as an electrolyte to design and customize smart windows based on individual preferences and requirements.

ETD exhibits dual‐chromism characteristics, transitioning from a colorless state to a purplehue at 25°C when 2V is applied. Furthermore, the purple color undergoes a transformation to blue coloration when the temperature exceeds 40°C.

A double‐fold carbon incorporation strategy of improving titania anode materials, namely coating titania nanoparticles with polypyrrole (PPY) and integrating them into a carbon nanotube (CNT) network, is introduced. This treatment not only ensures direct contact of individual titania nanoparticles with the conductive components in the composite but also builds a 3D interconnecting CNT framework to facilitate both mass and charge transfer. The TiO 2 /PPY/CNT composite delivers reversible capacity of 252 and 201 mAh g −1 at 0.1 and 1 C, respectively; achieves an ICE of 70%, which is the highest value so far, in an ether‐based electrolyte; and retains nearly 80% of its capacity in a 3000‐cycle test. Co‐compositing titania with PPY and CNT guarantees both efficient electrical connection of active materials and resilience against cycling, and this strategy is feasible for various electrode materials which usually need carbon incorporation to improve capacity and stabilize cycling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract F‐doped Li 2 MoO 3 (LMOF) nanosheets are successfully prepared by a facile method. The X‐Ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy results show that the thickness of the Li 2 MoO 3 sheets decreases gradually with increasing F doping amount, while the interlayer spacing along the z ‐axis increases. The X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results indicate that F doping is helpful for suppressing the irreversible phase transformation and the formation of Li 2 MoO 4 , and the relevant redox mechanism is discussed. Moreover, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that F‐doped samples exhibit a higher structural stability, which is important for the improvement of the electrochemical performance. The initial discharge capacities are 228.97, 229.74, 232.99, 238.07, and 250.07 mAh g −1 , respectively for the LMOF‐0, LMOF‐1, LMOF‐3, LMOF‐5, and LMOF‐7 samples. LMOF‐5 has the best performance, and it can deliver a specific capacity of 96.1 mAh g −1 at the 500th cycle at a charge/discharge current density of 1020 mA g −1 . The experiments identify the promising role of anion doping and offer some important information for the design and optimization of Li 2 MoO 3 ‐based cathode materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Here, a novel one‐step process is reported for the production of levulinic acid (LA) from furfural over hierarchical zeolites in a microwave reactor. The furfural conversion and product distribution are determined as a function of formalin concentration ( C F ) in water, catalyst properties, and heating mode. 20 wt% formalin is found to be the critical concentration, above and below which the 5‐hydroxymethylfurfrual and the LA are formed, respectively. The conversion and LA yield over H‐zeolite are higher by 2.3 and 17 times, respectively, as compared to those over Na‐zeolite. The Brønsted to Lewis acid sites ratio is found to be a crucial catalytic parameter to obtain the best activity and LA yield. Under optimal reaction conditions and with the best catalyst, 42% LA yield is obtained at 90% furfural conversion. The humins formed during the process are characterized using Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The humins yield, functionality, and decomposition temperatures are varied with both C F and catalyst properties. The reaction pathways and intermediates are also postulated. The integration of the developed process/route with the existing C6 routes allows the utilization of the entire carbohydrate content of the lignocellulosic biomass to produce LA, and consequently, the overall process becomes more economical.",

The effect of various undoped and doped carbon quantum dots is also investigated, synthesized from acetic acid and sucrose instead of graphite, on the electrochemical performance of sepia melanin.

The sepia/N,S GCQD symmetric supercapacitor in 0.5 m Na 2 SO 4(aq) exhibits promising capacitance retention ≈92% after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g −1 , 100% coulombic efficiency, 11 µW h cm −2 and 102 mW cm −2 maximum energy and power densities.

    "abstract": "Abstract While renewable power available worldwide costs increasingly less than the least expensive option based on fossil fuels, countries continue to increase their coal‐fired capacity, which should conversely fall by 80% within a decade to limit global warming effects. To address the challenges to the implementation of such an aim, here, a path is explored that leverages on a previously unrecognized aspect of coal, opening to a new solar‐driven carbon cycle that is environmentally friendly. By engineering the porosity matrix of coal into a suitably designed compressed volumetric structure, and by coupling it with a network of cotton fibers, it is possible to create a record performing device for freshwater production, with a desalination rate per raw material cost evaluated at 1.39 kg h $ at one sun intensity. This value is between two and three times higher than any other solar desalination device proposed to date. These results could envision a clean and socially sustainable cycle for carbon materials that, while enabling an enhanced water economy with global access to freshwater and sanitation, poses zero risks of reinjecting into the environment through competing economies in the fossil's market.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Producing thick films of conducting polymers by a low‐cost manufacturing technique would enable new applications. However, removing huge solvent volume from diluted suspension or dispersion (1–3 wt%) in which conducting polymers are typically obtained is a true manufacturing challenge. In this work, a procedure is proposed to quickly remove water from the conducting polymer poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(4‐styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) suspension. The PEDOT:PSS suspension is first flocculated with 1 m H 2 SO 4 transforming PEDOT nanoparticles (≈50–500 nm) into soft microparticles. A filtration process inspired by pulp dewatering in a paper machine on a wire mesh with apertures dimension between 60 µm and 0.5 mm leads to thick free‐standing films (≈0.5 mm). Wire mesh clogging that hinders dewatering (known as dead‐end filtration) is overcome by adding to the flocculated PEDOT:PSS dispersion carbon fibers that aggregate and form efficient water channels. Moreover, this enables fast formation of thick layers under simple atmospheric pressure filtration, thus making the process truly scalable. Thick freestanding PEDOT films thus obtained are used as electrocatalysts for efficient reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide, a promising green chemical and fuel. The inhomogeneity of the films does not affect their electrochemical function.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aluminum metal has been regarded as a promising anode material for aqueous metal‐air batteries. However, the stable cycling of Al anodes is challenging due to the severe parasitic corrosion of Al metal in alkaline electrolytes. Here, a novel additive, n ‐octylphosphonic acid (OPA), is introduced into the typical NaOH electrolyte system to improve the interfacial stability of Al anodes and thus promote high‐performance Al‐air batteries (AABs). Combining several experimental characterizations and theoretical calculation, it is proved that OPA molecules in an NaOH aqueous environment can modify the Al anode/electrolyte interface and alter the stacking of the discharge product. The electrolyte engineering is capable of anchoring dynamically to restrain side reactions through hydrogen bonds (H···O), homogenizing the dissolution of Al metal and avoiding precipitation agglomeration. As a proof of concept, AABs full cells with an electrolyte containing OPA achieve higher potential plateau and discharge capacity than those with a pure NaOH electrolyte. It paves a way to develop highly‐efficient and eco‐friendly electrolyte additive strategies for high‐performance AABs devices and advance the current understanding of organic additive mechanisms in AABs.",

In this study, a functional cost‐price model coupled with assessment index system and comprehensive evaluation method is developed for the description and assessment of water affordability degree (WAD) in China. The assessment index system integrates a cost‐price perspective of water affordability into a general model by incorporating 20 indicators belonging to six dimensions, including cost affordability of water pollution control, flood control and drought relief, soil and water conservation, and price affordability of irrigation water, residential water, and production water. This study obtains the spatiotemporal characteristics and the list of serious problems of water affordability in China, then discusses the regulatory focus of the water conservancy industry and the water pricing methods, so as to provide a reference for the national policy formulation of sustainable water management.",

Herein the authors describe a straightforward and easy‐to‐scale‐up strategy for the fabrication of lightweight and highly hydrophobic composites with superior mechanical strength, through the coating of commercial carbon felt (CF) with a thin mesoporous carbon phase (MC). Composites are prepared by a dip‐coating method starting from CF foams to be soaked in a water/ethanol solution of food‐grade components before undergoing two successive thermal treatments. They exhibit an extremely high efficiency and complete reusability in the recovery of oils and organic compounds from wastewaters both as classical absorbents under batch conditions or filters under continuum separation mode. Notably, the electrical conductivity/resistivity of composites has allowed their application to the recovery of water floating waxy organic residues. Indeed, absorbents can be heated up by the passage of an electrical current (DC) thus allowing semi‐solid organic pollutants to be melted and absorbed by the hydrophobic composite without sorbent fouling or deactivation. The outlined strategy towards cheap and scalable lightweight hydrophobic materials for wastewater cleaning and environmental remediation from oil spilling, is a highly attractive technology that offers concrete hints to the exploitation of these composites at industrial level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The industrial scale capture of CO 2 from flue gas streams is becoming an increasingly important environmental issue. However, many of the existing CO 2 capture systems either have regenerative energy demands that are too high or are cost prohibitive. A promising solution is the utilization of functionalized solid sorbents, such as porous polymer networks (PPNs). PPNs are attractive due to their inherent structural stability, flexibility, high surface areas, and ability to incorporate various functional groups within the chemical scaffold. Herein, a low cost, scalable alternative to common carbon capture systems using a series of robust mesoporous melamine‐formaldehyde resins (mPMFs) loaded with active alkylamine sorbents is presented, which is dubbed as the PPN‐150 family. The variants within this material class are differentiated based on the incorporation of functionalized dopants; small molecules added at low molar percent concentrations to impart additional functionality into the PPN in order to achieve low cost noncovalent tethering of alkylamines. The cyanuric acid doped PPN‐151‐DETA (DETA = diethylenetriamine) demonstrate unique features such as improved cycling capacity and heat of adsorption. To show its scalability, PPN‐151‐DETA is successfully synthesized at the 250 g scale without loss of the sorbent properties.",

This heat engine has been considered for use with conventional concentrating solar power (CSP) systems before. However, unlike previous single‐stage devices, the improved design uses two stages with an interstage reheat, allowing more economical and efficient conversion up to 29% at a hot side temperature of 850 °C. Herein, a cost‐performance analysis for this improved design assesses opportunities for distributed‐CSP in the context of micro‐combined heat and power systems. A high‐level techno‐economic analysis (TEA) is presented that explores four scenarios where a Na‐TEC is used as the heat engine for a distributed‐CSP system. Overnight capital cost and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) are estimated for a system lifetime of 30 years, revealing that overnight capital costs in a range from $3.57 to $17.71 per W e are feasible, which equate to LCOEs from 6.9 to 17.2 cents kWh e −1 . This analysis makes a significant contribution by concurrently quantifying the efficiency and unit costs for a range of multistage configurations, and demonstrating that a Na‐TEC may be a promising alternative to Stirling engines for distributed‐CSP systems at residential scale of 1–5 kW e .",

Quartz crystal microbalance, positron annihilation Doppler broadening and lifetime spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X‐ray diffraction are used to determine the deposition and structural properties of the films. As‐deposited films have low densities ρ ≈ 0.6 g cm −3 , contain small micropores and proteins, and exhibit corrugated surfaces. Annealing at temperatures of 300 °C or higher leads to the destruction and evaporation of most of the organic material, resulting in a thickness decrease of 50–60%, more pure titania films with increased density, an increase in micropore size and a decrease in the concentration and size of atomic‐scale vacancies. Up to 50 layers could be stacked, allowing easy control over the total layer thickness. Based on these titania films, first test devices consisting of natural dye‐sensitized solar cells are produced, that show photovoltaic activity and indicate possibilities for low‐cost, accessible, organic production of solar cells. Given the wide range of other applications for titania, this new method is a promising candidate for improving the fabrication of those products with respect to cost, sustainability, and production speed.",

For example, tested at 1 bar and 295 or 273 K, MDCs adsorb up to 22.0 and 29.4 wt% CO 2 , respectively. MDCs are also tailored to be hydrophobic, with CO 2 /H 2 O adsorption selectivity even after prolonged cycling. Maximum working capacities of 10.8 wt% for pure CO 2 and 3.5 wt% for a flue gas simulant (15% CO 2 , 85% N 2 ) are measured using temperature swing adsorption with dynamic purge gases, while being minimally affected by humid conditions. This work is directly aligned with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 13, take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monoclinic bismuth vanadate photoanodes promise high efficiency‐to‐cost ratios for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting owing to their suitable band structure and ease of synthesis. However, inadequate charge separation and sluggish oxidation kinetics remain a fundamental challenge. This study investigates bifacially interface engineered BiVO 4 photoanodes by considering a seed‐layer and NiOOH oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) over‐layer to regulate the charge carrier transport and improve the overall PEC water‐splitting performance. The modification of the BiVO 4 /FTO interface stimulates electron flow towards fluorine‐doped tin oxide (FTO) and a NiOOH over‐layer improves the facile hole transfer from BiVO 4 to the electrolyte. Compared to the moderate photocurrent density of a bare BiVO 4 photoanode (1.5 mA cm −2 ), the interface‐engineered Seed_BiVO 4 _NiOOH photoanode shows a remarkably high (≈3.4 times higher) photocurrent density of 5.10 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode with impressive long‐term stability over 9 h under illumination. The optimally interface engineered Seed_BiVO 4 _NiOOH photoanode shows an excellent photoconversion efficiency (1.83%), with significant improvement in bulk charge separation efficiency. This work presents a promising strategy for the development of a highly stable PEC water‐splitting device and eliminates the intrinsic material shortcomings of the bare BiVO 4 photoanode by modulating the carrier transport via bifacial interface engineering.",

The prGO‐MoS 2 exhibits thin sheets of prGO covered more or less uniformly with nano‐MoS 2 , and the open architecture gives enhanced accessibility to the S 2– and oxygen moieties present in prGO‐MoS 2 . A single treatment of contaminated water samples with prGO‐MoS 2 rapidly decreases the concentration of Pb(II) from 10 000 ppb to 0.8642 ppb within ≤3 min with an efficiency of ≥99.99% (4 log reduction value) at a V/m ratio of 2000 mL mg −1 . Among the reported materials for Pb(II) removal, prGO‐MoS 2 exhibits the fastest removal speed (≤3 min) and the second‐highest adsorption capacity (762 mg g −1 ), and the highest distribution coefficient ( K d = 6.0 × 10 8 mL g −1 ).

The results show that 1) China's GTFEE exhibits path‐dependent and agglomeration characteristics in terms of time and space, respectively. In both spatial and temporal dimensions, an increase in local GTFEE stimulates future local GTFEE and inhibits future GTFEE growth in neighboring areas. 2) R&amp;D capital market distortion has a continuous inhibiting effect on the local GTFEE in the short and long terms. R&amp;D labor market distortion has a continuous stimulating effect on the local GTFEE, and its effect gradually strengthens. 3) R&amp;D capital market distortion may indirectly weaken the GTFEE by inhibiting green innovation and industrial upgrading. R&amp;D labor market distortion may indirectly improve the regional GTFEE by suppressing the energy rebound effect and improving green innovation.

Two different wood layers are used to fabricate a wood scroll with diagonal natural water channels (d‐WS) and a wood scroll with parallel natural water channels (p‐WS). Because only diagonal channels allow water transport across the wood layer, d‐WS exhibits good lateral water transport, whereas p‐WS exhibits poor lateral water transport. The gap channels (i.e., spaces between the overlapping wood layers) facilitate vertical water transport in both d‐WS and p‐WS. The synergistic effect of the gap channels and diagonal channels in d‐WS allows for a uniform water flow and sufficient water transport to the top and side surfaces, thus simultaneously increasing evaporation performance and salt resistance. The total evaporation rate of water of d‐WS is 9.08 kg m −2 h −1 in the absence of wind, which increases to 37.95 kg m −2 h −1 in the presence of 2 m s −1 wind. These evaporation rates are among the highest values ever reported under similar conditions. The evaporation rate of d‐WS does not deteriorate even after 5 d, demonstrating the possibility of long‐term operation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Clean hydrogen production is crucial to the prospects of the energy transition. Electrochemical water splitting is one of the most promising tools for the sustainable and efficient production of hydrogen. One of the main open challenges is the replacement of precious Pt for electrodes with new materials combining cheapness, robustness to CO poisoning, and fast reaction kinetics. Group‐10 metal chalcogenides represent suitable candidates to address all main open challenges in the quest for alternative materials to pure Pt as electrocatalysts, with the further advantage of the ease of their synthesis as both bulk crystals and nanostructures. All compounds of this class of materials show surface stability, chemical inertness toward CO adsorption, and electrode durability in acidic and alkaline environments. Here, the physicochemical mechanisms ruling hydrogen production with group‐10 metal chalcogenides are focused on by combining surface‐science experiments and theory. Especially, the Tafel slope in Pt 3 Te 4 nanocrystals and NiTe 2 nanotubes is as low as 32 and 59 mV dec −1 , respectively, making them competitive with state‐of‐the‐art reference materials Pt and Pt/C already in the first implementation. Moreover, the presence of massless Dirac‐cone electrons in many group‐10 metal chalcogenides, with an intrinsically large electron mobility, is naturally beneficial for fast electron transfer, and correspondingly, for fast reaction kinetics. These results pave the way for the advent of this new class of materials in electrocatalysis, and for sustainable hydrogen production through water splitting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the increasing application of natural spherical graphite in lithium‐ion battery negative electrode materials widely used, the sustainable production process for spherical graphite (SG) has become one of the critical factors to achieve the double carbon goals. The purification process of SG employs hydrofluoric acid process, acid–alkali process, high‐temperature process, and chlorination roasting process in the latter process. Currently, the most widely used processes in China are the hydrofluoric acid process and the acid–alkali process, but the implementation of China's new environmental protection policy has claimed higher demands on SG production. Aimed at China's environmental policies and the production situation, this article introduces the purification principles and compares processing technology characteristics of the four processes, respectively. A model of the four SG purification processes under the same production capacity is simulated to analyze the main constraints of production including pollutant emissions, raw materials, and energy used. Based on the analysis of the sustainability of the four purification processes, it can be concluded that the high temperature roasting process is the best way to maintain sustainable projects under the condition of overcoming its high cost, according to China.",

Carbon allotropes are eco‐friendly materials, and improving their photocatalytic properties via doping‐induced modifications is one of the most attractive research areas. In this context, various first‐row transition‐metal‐ion‐doped reduced graphene oxide samples are synthesized and characterized using high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy along with X‐ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate their morphological and electronic structures at the molecular level. Transition metal‐ion doping produces several defect structures at the oxygen functionalities of reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (rGO). Such defect structures are well correlated with their photocatalytic activity; Cr@rGO and Fe@rGO exhibit decent activities among the four tested rGO samples in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and selective oxidation of 2,5‐hydroxymethylfurfural. To test the environmental factors, cytotoxicity tests are performed by incubating the modified rGO with human skin cells; Fe@rGO is found to be the least toxic. Therefore, Fe@rGO displayed both enhanced photocatalytic activity and environment‐friendly character as compared to the bare rGO, indicating that it is a plausible candidate for application in the petrochemical transformation of biomass without environmental concerns.",

In this work, a fast and facilely performance enhancement strategy is first proposed for various Fe─N─C catalysts by supplying different direct‐current voltages to achieve a rapid solid‐state activation at room temperature. The voltage‐activated state‐of‐the‐art Fe─N─C catalyst has demonstrated a peak power density of 1.1 W cm −2 for PEMFC and remarkably increased long‐term durability for ORR. The substantially improved performance can be attributed to the formation of highly active ketone‐decorated (edge‐hosted) FeN 4 sites and substantially boosts coupled proton−electron transfer (CPET) by improving the conductivity of the as‐synthesized Fe─N─C with an interpenetrating network structure. The interconnected micro‐nodes within the interpenetrating network are the main active regions for the ORR, evidenced by an optimized structural model based on the above typical morphology. Therefore, this finding provides an innovative and facile idea for solving the activity and stability deficiency for promising Fe─N─C for commercial PEMFC.",

In this work, it is demonstrated that engineering the surface aerophilicity of heterogeneous catalyst enables fast mass transfer of O 3 reactant, giving rise to much enhanced catalytic ozonation performance. Taking active 4A zeolite catalyst as an example, the aerophilicity of spherical 4A zeolite can be greatly enhanced by coating polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with low surface energy, and the optimized sample exhibits a 99.5% removal of atrazine (ATZ) within 20 min (corresponding to a k of 0.269 min −1 ), much better than 4A zeolite without surface aerophilicity engineering ( k ≈0.156 min −1 ). The PTFE coating does not change the ozone activation mechanism and degradation pathways for ATZ, further demonstrating that the enhanced ozonation activity is attributed to the enhanced mass transfer process. In addition, the general applicability of this surface aerophilicity and the potential ozonation application for industrial wastewater treatment are both demonstrated.",

This study synthesizes two nanomaterials, Ce‐doped Ni–Al mixed metal oxide (CNAO) and Mn‐doped Ni–Al mixed metal oxide (MNAO), from Mn‐ and Ce‐doped Ni–Al‐layered double hydroxides using a co‐precipitation method followed by a calcination process. The materials are characterized using various techniques, such as High‐resolution transmission electron microscopy‐energy dispersive x‐ray spectroscopy/selected area electron dispersion (HRTEM‐EDS/SAED), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), x‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer‐Emmett‐Teller (BET), and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT‐IR). The CO 2 adsorption performance of the materials is evaluated using packed‐bed column experiments at the testing conditions of 13 vol% ± 1 vol% CO 2 in N 2 simulated flue gas, flow rate of 20 mL min −1 , inlet pressure of 14.15 ± 0.1 psi, and temperature of 31 °C ± 2 °C. The results show that both CNAO and MNAO are promising nanomaterials for CO 2 capture applications due to their high CO 2 adsorption capacity and efficiency. CNAO has a higher saturation capacity of 11.4 mmol g −1 and a longer breakthrough time than MNAO, which has a saturation capacity of 10.0 mmol g −1 . The doping of Ce and Mn enhances the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the materials compared to the un‐doped Ni–Al mixed oxide. The mechanisms of CO 2 adsorption are mainly linearly adsorbed CO 2 , bidentate, and monodentate or bulk carbonate formation, as revealed by ATR FT‐IR analysis. The regeneration performance results suggest that CNAO is more stable than MNAO under multiple regeneration cycles and more promising material for large‐scale CO 2 capture applications.",

Liquid electrolytes have good ionic conductivity but tend to be flammable, prompting some of the safety concerns that are associated with these devices. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are presented as a potential solution to this problem. These materials have higher mechanical stability and can be formulated to be non‐flammable. However, ionic conductivity in solid polymer electrolytes tends to be several orders of magnitude lower than that of liquid electrolytes, significantly limiting device performance making electrolyte safety and performance difficult to optimize simultaneously. However, gel electrolytes which combine lower flammability, higher mechanical strength, and adequate ionic conductivity may present a solution to this challenge. To this end, the melt processing of hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR) with poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC) followed by the in situ formation of ethylene carbonate (EC) is reported. Conversion of PEC to EC is confirmed via NMR spectroscopy. Electrochemical testing reveals improved ionic conductivity following the conversion of the solid polymer electrolyte to the gel polymer electrolyte. Improvements in ionic conductivity, relative to the initial SPE, are attributed to decreased salt‐polymer interactions in favor of salt‐EC interactions as observed via differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil pollution, caused by potentially toxic elements (PTEs), is a significant problem worldwide. This study has investigated the key factors that control the mobility and fate of six PTEs (Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Ni) which are frequently detected in contaminated soils. The findings of this study demonstrate that smaller particles present in soil show stronger adsorption capacity compared to larger particles because of the higher specific surface area. Moreover, soil with higher organic matter content (e.g., humic acid) exhibits stronger adsorption capacity due to the presence of abundant functional groups namely hydroxyl (─OH) and carboxyl (─COOH). Notably, these functional groups possess high affinity for Pb adsorption, followed by Cd &gt; Cu &gt; Cr &gt; Zn &gt; Ni. The adsorption of most of the PTEs by soil with and without humic acid is better described by the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo‐second‐order kinetic model. Overall, the experimental results illustrate that soil with high contents of humic acid can restrict the mobility of PTEs. This mechanistic evaluation predicts how soils with different organic matter contents respond to PTEs pollution. This study outcome will be helpful in developing sustainable remediation strategies to tackle pollution caused by PTEs in the soil environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In heterojunction photocatalysts, the band edge alignment and internal electric field (IEF) direction significantly affect the charge carrier separation, thus the photoconversion efficiency. For example, because of an unfavorable band alignment and compared to BiVO 4 alone, BiVO 4 /TiO 2 results in ≈24% reduction in photocurrent density in this study. Herein, a tungsten‐doped VO 2 (W‐VO 2 ) thin film is inserted between BiVO 4 and TiO 2 to modify unfavorable spike‐like conduction band offset and IEF direction in ternary heterojunction. After reversing the IEF direction and engineering the band edges through W‐VO 2 insertion, the photocurrent density is enhanced by ≈145% and ≈91% compared to BiVO 4 /TiO 2 and BiVO 4 , respectively at 1.23 V versus RHE. Besides, under visible light irradiation, the kinetics rate constant for tetracycline removal by BiVO 4 /W‐VO 2 /TiO 2 photocatalyst is 225% higher than that of BiVO 4 /TiO 2 , due to utilizing charge carriers before being recombined, without doping the BiVO 4 and TiO 2 structures. Lastly, LC‐HR‐MS/MS analysis followed by the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.) reveals the high importance of the band alignment on the detoxification of the solution. The tunability of the VO 2 work function with a low bandgap, yet distinctive valence and conduction bands (which distinguished it from metals) opens new avenues for designing high‐performance heterojunction‐based devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermoelectric (TE) materials can effectively convert waste heat into electricity, which is a key technology for solving energy shortage problems. Poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), as a promising energy conversion material, has attracted much attention due to its easy doping, low toxicity, and high flexibility. However, the TE performance of PEDOT still needs further improvement. In this work, vapor phase polymerization (VPP) and ionic liquid (IL) post‐treatment are combined to obtain high‐performance PEDOT film. It is demonstrated that by varying the polymerization conditions, the optimal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of PEDOT‐Tos are 947 S cm −1 and 18.3 µV K −1 , respectively. Furthermore, after treatment with 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM BF 4 ), its power factor can be further enhanced to a maximum value of 154.58 µW m −1 K −2 , which is 4.9 times higher than that without treatment (31.67 µW m −1 K −2 ). The enhanced TE performance of PEDOT is largely due to changes in doping levels and morphology, which have been confirmed through different characterization methods. These results will contribute to the preparation of high‐performance PEDOT films by the VPP method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This research investigates the development of ultrathin polyamide (PA) desalination membranes via electrospray fabrication, balancing the trade‐offs between selectivity and permeability. The unique contribution to the improvement of desalination performance is the integration of protonated montmorillonite nanoclay (MMT‐H + ) and hyperbranched amino‐polyol cellulose nanocrystals (APCNC) as co‐nanofillers during the in situ interfacial polymerization process. Synergistic effect of the nanofillers is demonstrated in the resultant spherulitic PA thin‐film nanocomposite (TFN) membrane, achieving salt rejection of up to 99.7% against simulated brackish water. Moreover, the membrane's superior boron removal efficiency at neutral pH, observed at 76.7% in a single‐stage desalination process, is attributed to the reduced membrane pore size, disruption of water‐boron association by the spherulites, and complexation and electrostatic interaction with the abundant hydroxyl and amine groups along the APCNC polymeric chains. This process eliminates the need for pH adjustment, thereby enhancing the membrane's practicality and efficiency. The findings of this study provide significant insights into the interactions between boron and the membrane surface, laying the groundwork for the development of effective TFN desalination membranes for water purification and boron removal. The implication of these findings extends beyond academic interest, offering a promising strategy for addressing the global water scarcity crisis.",

When a smart window switches from a clear to a translucent state, energy flow through the window is partially attenuated, allowing a room to cool down passively, thereby reducing the energy and fossil fuel consumption for air conditioning. The smart window demonstrated here consists of a thermoresponsive liquid consisting of Tergitol 15‐S‐7, which can dynamically and passively switch the window's transmittance when a temperature of 39 °C is reached. It is also demonstrated how the transition temperature can be lowered by adding salts. Outdoor experiments in realistic environments show that the temperature of a model house built with a thermo‐responsive window can achieve an indoor temperature of 7 °C less than a control house with an ordinary window.

Raman spectroscopy and microscopy is used to analyse the interfacial properties, in particular the transition of cellulose fibers to carbonized graphene flakes through photothermal pyrolysis, leading to the formation of coral‐like structures. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, flexible resistive heaters have been manufactured and tests show rapid heating with a homogeneous distribution and a maximum temperature of 145.5 °C. Additionally, an electro‐thermal conversion efficiency (hr+c) of 17.05 mW (°C cm 2 )−1 is achieved. Finally, a comparative Life Cycle Assessment with FR‐4 based electronics has been undertaken and the environmental impacts are calculated. The impact assessment shows a two magnitude lower impact on the environment for most categories, which suggests the approach is beneficial for the environment at a global production level.

Therefore, the recycling process of spent LIBs should be simple and efficient and minimize the input of raw materials. This work uses residual Al impurities from current collectors combined with high‐temperature Li supplementation to directly repair spent Li 1‐x CoO 2 cathode into regenerated materials enhanced with Al doping and LiF coating without additional synthesis steps or cost. The regenerated materials demonstrate an enhanced electrochemical performance compared to commercial cathode material. The modified materials exhibit a notable initial discharge capacity of 181 mA h g −1 , with a commendable capacity retention of 80.4% after 400 cycles at a 4.5 V cut‐off voltage. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the enhanced crystalline and structural stability of the regenerated materials. Furthermore, the superiority of spent materials over commercial materials modification is clarified for the first time through characterizations and theoretical calculations due to their degraded crystalline structure and abundant Li vacancies. This up‐cycling strategy not only contributes to sustainable waste management of spent LIBs but also provides a potential “shortcut” for advancing next‐generation high‐performance batteries.",

However, the unsatisfactory intrinsic activity of these catalysts still poses a major challenge, limiting their overall effectiveness. One approach to addressing this challenge is the introduction of metal clusters, which can form a synergistic effect with the single atoms, ultimately improving their performance. In this study, core‐shell structured carbon polymer is constructed with Zn atoms and Sn nanoclusters by directly subjecting pyrolysis of the covalent organic polymer (COP) and metal organic framework (MOF) (COP@MOF). The thin COP shell serves a dual purpose: it prevents the collapse and aggregation of zeolitic imidazolate framework‐8 (ZIF‐8) and promotes the formation of mesopores, facilitating mass transport and enhancing the graphitization degree to improve conductivity. The resulting Sn‐COP@MOF 800 exhibits promising catalytic performance in the ORR, demonstrating a half‐wave potential of 0.81 V and current density of 5.56 mA cm −2 in 0.1 m KOH, which is comparable to that of Pt/C.

It is composed of g‐C 3 N 4 @TiO 2 heterojunction as the photocatalyst, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the photothermal materials, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) network as water transportation material. The high photocatalytic activity of heterojunction enables the g‐C 3 N 4 @TiO 2 /CNTs/PVA (CTCP) evaporator to photodegrade the accumulated dye molecules on its evaporation surface under light irradiation during purifying dye sewage. More remarkably, the integrated CTCP evaporator achieves a stable evaporation rate of 2.30 kg m −2 h −1 in 1 mg mL −1 RhB solution with continuous light irradiation for 100 h, exhibiting preeminent long‐term stability. With the capacities of long‐term stable and high‐rate purification of high‐concentration dye sewage, it is expected that this CTCP evaporator provides an effective alternative to treat high‐concentration dye sewage and has direct implications in engineering multifunctional solar evaporators for complex wastewater treatment.",

Water samples are collected for five years (2015–2019) at six different sampling points, to assess the presence and potential risk of CECs, including some widely used drugs: clofibric acid, paracetamol carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ofloxacin, ketoprofen, and sotalol; an alkaloid: caffeine; synthetic flavourings: galaxolide and tonalide; and a plasticiser: bisphenol A.

In this study, the disproportionation and transalkylation reactions of MLCT‐related model compound, i.e., 2,6‐DMP, in phenol over zeolite catalysts are investigated using a fixed‐bed reactor for sustainable new option to utilize MLCT‐derived phenolic mixtures. Reactivity is promoted at high temperatures and associated with zeolite acidity and pore structure. Since disproportionation and transalkylation reactions have certain spatial requirements, the micropores of MFI‐type zeolite may cause spatial barriers that make it difficult to carry out the reactions. MCM‐22, characterized by MWW‐type zeolite, maximized the conversion of 2,6‐DMP due to its strong Bronsted acidity and large mesopore volume. FAU‐type zeolite HY with a 3D large 12‐ring through‐channel shows relatively small spatial confinement and certain molecular sieving ability, which enables bimolecular reactions while allowing cresols to flow out of the pores efficiently to obtain the highest cresol selectivity. The addition of phenol significantly inhibits the spontaneous disproportionation of 2,6‐DMP to tricresol. Besides, o‐cresol dominate the cresol products, suggesting that the selectivity of o‐cresol is kinetically controlled.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing challenge of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic bottle waste underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions. This study introduces a pioneering approach to repurpose PET waste into valuable electrolytic material for electrochromic (EC) smart windows, presenting a novel strategy to address environmental concerns while advancing technology. Through alkaline depolymerization, disodium terephthalate (DST) electrolyte is derived from PET waste, offering an eco‐friendly and cost‐effective alternative. Integrated with chromogens such as 1‐hexyl‐[4,4′‐bipyridin]‐1‐ium iodide [MV(I)], or 1,1′‐dihexyl‐[4,4′‐bipyridine]‐1,1′‐diium iodide [DVH(I)], or 1,1′‐dihexyl‐[4,4′‐bipyridine]‐1,1′‐diium dihexafluorophosphate [DVH(PF 6 )], alongside hydroquinone [HQ] and poly(ethyene glycol) diacrylate [PEGDA]: water, novel EC gel‐based devices are fabricated. Notably, ED‐3 exhibits dual‐band absorption across the visible to near‐infrared spectrum, enabling seamless color transitions and exceptional optical contrast. With (ΔT) values of 88.03% at 550 nm and 73.7% at 900 nm, along with a coloration efficiency of 277 cm 2 C⁻¹ and cyclic stability exceeding 2000 cycles, this innovative approach marks a significant advancement in PET waste upcycling for EC applications. Furthermore, this research contributes to addressing the global challenges of plastic waste pollution and energy consumption, underscoring the transformative potential of sustainable material development.",

Conventional water‐based ice cubes present challenges from meltwater being breeding grounds for microorganisms and heightening the risk for cross‐contamination. Hereby, the presented cellulose‐based hydrogels crosslinked by epichlorohydrin are dip‐coated with alginate/calcium chloride to form a core–shell structure for achieving the critical benchmarks of an ideal food coolant with limited meltwater production, high‐water retention capacity, and high mechanical strength. The structures and properties of the hydrogels before and after freeze–thaw cycles are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, compressive test, water retention test, and differential scanning calorimetry. All formulated hydrogels demonstrate promising compressive strength, latent heat of fusion, and water retention properties. Notably, the C2A10Cl hydrogel exhibits a maximum compressive strength of 144.7 kPa and high latent heat of fusion of 272.5 J g –1 , which is better than previously reported sustainable hydrogel coolants. Furthermore, comparison studies reveal that the cellulose‐based hydrogels demonstrate a similar thawing pattern to conventional ice cubes but without the generation of any meltwater. The temperature of blueberries can be cooled down from 22 to 3.9 °C in 32 min by the hydrogels and in 26 min by ice cubes, respectively.",

To effectively reduce the nitrate content in wastewater, the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (e‐NO 3 RR) is widely recognized as an ideal treatment method due to its high reliability and efficiency. The selection of catalyst material plays a decisive role in e‐NO 3 RR performance. Copper‐based catalysts, with their ease of acquisition, high activity, and selectivity for NH 3 , have emerged as the most promising candidates for e‐NO 3 RR applications. In this paper, the mechanism of e‐NO 3 RR is first introduced. Then the relationship between structural properties and catalytic performance of copper‐based catalysts is analyzed in detail from four aspects: nanomaterials, oxides, monoatomic, and bimetallic materials. Strategies for constructing efficient catalysts are discussed, including surface modulation, defect engineering, heteroatom doping, and coordination effects. Finally, the challenges and prospects of copper‐based catalysts with high e‐NO 3 RR performance in practical applications are outlined.",

Research efforts have highlighted GAC alternatives, yet few reports of environmental and economic impacts associated with these technologies are available. Herein, a life cycle assessment (LCA) aids in assessment of environmental impacts associated with six munitions wastewater treatment configurations—specifically GAC, compared to five configurations that include combinations of ion exchange (IX), reverse osmosis (RO), aerobic granular reactors (AGR), UV/H 2 O 2 , and ozone technologies. The LCA compares environmental impacts generated by treating 1 m 3 of munitions wastewater, impacts by life cycle stage, and effects of IX, RO, and GAC replacement frequency. Results show that IX resin pairs with AGR (for flow‐through treatment) and ozone (for IX regenerant treatment) generated 22 ± 18% less impact than GAC in nine of ten environmental impact categories during production, transportation, and disposal. Treatment trains with ozone or AGR produce 35% less environmental impact than those with UV/H 2 O 2 . Production and use stages generate more environmental impacts than transportation and disposal stages for most treatment technologies. This LCA provides insights into the sustainability of six munition wastewater treatment technologies and identifies areas where treatment sustainability can be improved.",

The composites are fabricated by combining TiO 2 hollow spheres and CeO 2 nanoparticles with changing the ratio between Ce and Ti. High‐resolution microscopic and spectroscopic analysis demonstrates that three types of cerium‐bearing structures form on the surface of the titania. The first involves Ce atoms adsorbed onto the surface of TiO 2 particles. The second occurs with small CeO 2 particles, ≈2 nm in size, resulting from the aggregation of the adsorbed Ce atoms, thus forming a CeO 2 –TiO 2 heterojunction. The last type is obtained through the growth of the CeO 2 particles up to 10 nm in size. All the CeO 2 –TiO 2 composites exhibit enhanced photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation compared to mere CeO 2 or TiO 2 nanoparticles. The synergistic effect of these three structures leads to a competition between size effects and interface interactions, which affects the band alignment, the number of defects, and, consequently, the PC activity. The highest PC reaction rate constant under visible light reaches up to 0.017 min −1 and is achieved when the CeO 2 nanoparticle size is smaller than its Debye length.",

On the other hand, silicon that possesses high capacity but significant volume changes during cycling limits its practical use.

This work emphasizes the potential of recycled spent graphite (SG) composited with nSi anode in order to fulfill the demand for high capacity anodes. SG to nSi ratio is systematically designed of the composite for LIB applications. The structural, morphological, and surface chemical analysis are conducted and further correlated with the electrochemical performances of the composite anodes. The nanocomposite with equal ratio of SG:nSi (1:1) exhibited high reversible capacity of 1886 mAh g −1 while the SG dominant ratio of SG:nSi (3:1) delivered a least capacity loss of less than 2.2 mAh g −1 cycle −1 for 200 cycles. Nanocomposites exhibited satisfactory electrochemical performance; especially improving cycling stability. The enhanced performance is attributed to the stable solid‐electrolyte interface layer formation which is further characterized by ex situ X‐ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis with different state of charge and discharge conditions.",

On the other hand, the tests reveal the role of the gold in decreasing the polarization and increasing the cell life. Therefore, the results suggest the combination of carbons with various morphologies as a suitable architecture for hosting the Li‐O 2 reaction products and allowing their reversible reaction.

However, the advancement of seawater electrolysis is hindered by notable impediments caused by chloride corrosion at the anode and the simultaneous chlorine evolution process. Only a limited number of non‐noble electrocatalysts demonstrate noteworthy bifunctional catalytic efficacy and long‐term durability.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study proposes a novel, cost‐effective nano CoFe 2 O 4 ‐decorated halloysite nanotubes (CoFe 2 O 4 /HNT) catalyst, which effectively degrades the antibiotic ornidazole (ONZ) through peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. By using a simple and economical preparation method, ultra‐low amounts of CoFe 2 O 4 are uniformly loaded onto HNTs, significantly improving the activity and stability of the catalyst. The experimental results show that the CoFe 2 O 4 /HNT+PMS system can almost completely degrade ONZ within 1 h, with good pH adaptability and resistance to anion interference. The simple synthesis process and low cost of CoFe 2 O 4 /HNT make it highly practical for large‐scale applications. Mechanism studies have shown that the synergistic effect between Co and Fe greatly improves the activation efficiency of PMS, generating reactive oxygen species (such as 1 O 2 ) that play a key role in ONZ degradation. This work not only elucidates the activation mechanism, but also provides insightful information for advanced oxidation processes (AOP). The results indicate the practicality and importance of CoFe 2 O 4 /HNT catalyst in treating harmful pollutants in water, supporting effective and sustainable water purification technologies. In addition, the study emphasizes the elasticity and adaptability of this innovative catalyst system in managing various pollutants, indicating its broad potential for environmental applications.",

Showcasing the lack of clarity in funding structures at the German national and federal‐state levels highlights the linked obstruction of necessary actions, implementation options, and financial resources for peatland protection. This poses challenges to climate protection, adaptation efforts, and the achievement of related Sustainable Development Goals. In Germany, an update of peatland protection policies highlights the structural challenges in coordinating peatland protection efforts and helps identify gaps and opportunities. A mixed methods approach is used to analyze both strategic documents and the results of a survey on associated funding. The results indicate a multi‐level policy structure with several German federal states recognizing the potential and relevance of peatland protection but still facing obstacles regarding the distribution of responsibilities, data availability, and overall structures. Recognizing peatland protection as a wicked problem can highlight research gaps and help in developing individual solutions that can be transferred to an international level.",

It is previously revealed that Brønsted acid‐free Sn‐Beta zeolites selectively produced light olefins from polyolefin cracking. Brønsted acid sites ionize olefins by protonation and the generated carbenium ions are converted into other hydrocarbons via various reactions, thereby the elimination of their effects led to the improvement of light olefin production ability. However, the deactivation of zeolites by coke deposition is a critical problem for industrialization. Inhibition of coking deactivation is previously achieved by doping Cr 6+ species connected to silanol groups in zeolites. This work aimed to inhibit coke deposition and realize selective and continuous production of light olefins through repetitive polyolefin catalytic cracking. Sn‐Beta zeolites are prepared with various crystallinity by changing the feed fluoride ions content in their synthesis and found that their activity on low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) cracking strongly depended on the feed F/Si ratios, implying the active sites for polyolefin cracking are Lewis acidic open‐Sn sites. Moreover, Cr 6+ ‐doped Sn‐Beta zeolites showed over 45% light olefin yields even in the third LDPE cracking test, although excess Cr adding led to reduce the catalytic activity of Sn‐Beta zeolites.",

A high hydrogen production rate of 21.43 mmol·g −1 ·h −1 is obtained using glycolic acid as substrate.

To date, HC is produced exclusively by charring organic precursors in inert atmospheres. One would not expect to find HC in rice hull ash (RHA), the byproduct of rice hull combustion processes. However, in developing approaches to depolymerize RHA SiO 2 (90:10 wt% SiO 2 :C) to produce silica‐depleted RHA or SDRHA 40‐60 (40–60 wt% SiO 2 ) to tailor C:SiO 2 ratios for carbothermal reduction reactions, the SDRHA carbon component is recently revisited. In more detailed efforts to characterize the form of carbon present in SDRHA, a series of analyses reveal graphitized carbon domains in amorphous matrices, i.e., HC, despite RHA being produced via combustion in an oxidizing atmosphere. Comprehensive electrochemical analyses on SDRHA 40‐60 find unexpected capacities far in excess (&gt;700 mAh g −1 ) of reported values for HC and graphite. Electrochemical and STEM characterization suggest that the unexpected capacity may come from the nanoscale morphology of the amorphous carbon component. Given that RHA is a biowaste generated in kilotons/year worldwide, there seems to be an opportunity to develop sustainable high‐capacity anode materials for alkali‐ion storage systems.",

All synthesized Ru@COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ systems demonstrate efficiency in the photocatalytic OER, with the highest turnover number (TON) of 9.1 observed for the system where the Ru‐based WOC is incorporated every fourth COF‐TFPT‐IsoQ unit cell.

However, combining reversible exchange reactions together with phase separation phenomena appears as a promising approach. Herein, a simple and up‐scalable extrusion process is proposed, involving commercial maleated ethylene propylene rubber (EPRgMA), maleated polypropylene (PPgMA), and a suitable crosslinker. It is shown that a crosslinker enabling disulfide exchange reactions can provide local and long‐range rearrangements required for extrusion, yielding a robust crosslinked blend (BlendSS) with strength of 15 MPa and an impressive elongation of 1000%. Moreover, the presence of the disulfide crosslinker provided the required fast exchanges for three repetitive recycling cycles by extrusion with close to 80% retention of initial properties. In comparison, the use of a crosslinker without the capability to establish reversible reactions (BlendCC), yielded crosslinked blends of marginal compatibility, strength of 4 MPa and only 40% elongation. The absence of reversible reactions restricted chain rearrangements and consecutive recycling is only possible by compression molding. The recycled blends presented even lower compatibility, elasticity and thermomechanical performance, demonstrating that the proper design of interfacial interactions between PPgMA and EPRgMA can build a bridge between processability, performance, and high‐throughput recyclability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hybrid semiconductor‐metal nanostructures are promising candidates for converting light into chemical energy by photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, many photocatalysts are prone to photocorrosion which limits their long‐term stability and thus their long‐term functionality needed for commercial applications. This study provides an in‐depth insight into the photocorrosion‐induced changes altering the chemical and photophysical properties of platinized CdSe‐seeded CdS nanorods (CdSe/CdS/Pt) during the photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous ethanol solutions at very high pH values. Using a combination of mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, with in situ absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, it is shown that the ligand shell consisting of 11‐MUA does not directly contribute to the generated hydrogen, although it is gradually degraded by present OH • radicals. Instead, the degradation of the ligand shell first leads to higher reactivity over time and finally to aggregation of the photocatalyst once a sweet spot is crossed. The inorganic CdSe/CdS/Pt particles are then reacting with OH • radicals to break apart into different pieces to transform into polymeric sulphur and Cd 2+ . This shows that the presence of OH • radicals can be very beneficial as an effective hole scavenger but can also lead to degradation of the whole colloidal nanostructure at longer reaction times.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Phthalates have become a widespread environmental pollutant that has severe implications for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They are found in various sources, including industrial processes, consumer products, and food packaging, resulting in significant environmental contamination. Their persistence and ability to bioaccumulate present significant risks, especially impacting reproductive, developmental, and endocrine systems in humans. This review explores how phthalates function as mixed micropollutants, adding complexity to their evaluation and control in environmental systems. It also focuses on remediation strategies using novel biotechnological approaches, such as enzymatic degradation, genetic engineering, microbial remediation, and nanotechnology‐based approaches. Enzymatic degradation utilizes specific enzymes for the breakdown of phthalates, thereby, transforming them into less toxic metabolites. Novel genetic engineering techniques have opened possibilities for improving the breakdown of phthalates by microorganisms, offering potential solutions for more efficient remediation. Nanotechnology‐based approaches showcase the effectiveness of nanomaterials in absorbing and breaking down phthalates on a molecular scale. This review also highlights the importance of microbial consortia and biochar‐microbial composites for environmental restoration. The unique contribution of this review lies in its comprehensive analysis of advanced biotechnological strategies for phthalate remediation, emphasizing the synergistic potential of novel techniques to protect and safeguard the environment for future generations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To boost the energy storage performance of supercapacitor devices, it is essential to design electrode material through rational manipulation of electrode material with their structural and morphological properties. Therefore, the present study highlights the binder‐free, and scalable synthesis of the nickel vanadate (NV) thin films using a chemical bath deposition approach with the variation of the hydrolyzing agent (urea). The present investigation inclusively demonstrates that variations in urea concentration in the synthesis of NV electrode material substantially influence both physicochemical and electrochemical performance. The optimal concentration (0.075 m ) of urea in the synthesis of the C‐NV3 sample provides the nanoparticles of NV with a maximum specific surface area of ∼42.1 m 2 g −1 , delivering a maximum specific capacitance ( C sp ) of 692 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 current density. Furthermore, both hybrid aqueous supercapacitor device and hybrid solid‐state supercapacitor device (HSSD) are fabricated. The HSSD exhibits a C sp of 84 F g −1 alongside a SE of 29.8 Wh kg −1 at an SP of 1120 W kg −1 . Thus, the present work opens a pathway to the binder‐free preparation of NV thin films, which are efficient cathodes in practical applications for hybrid energy storage devices.",

Functional porous materials have provided significant progress in the removal of dyes from wastewater using adsorption methods. Yet, the correlation and deeper understanding of the physicochemical properties of the porous materials and the dye remains a great challenge. Although ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) have unique beneficial features for dye separation, such as high surface area, uniform pore size, good mechanical and thermal stability, so far no report explores OMCs for selective dye adsorption from mixtures. Herein, OMCs of different morphologies and structures are synthesized via nanocasting and modification with methionine amino acid as new adsorbents for rhodamine B and sunset yellow FCF dyes. The results confirm that the obtained carbon materials have a significantly better affinity to rhodamine B than to sunset yellow FCF, which is related to the presence of a high number of acidic functional groups on their surface. In addition, the morphology of materials plays also an important role in the adsorption process. Carbon spheres with wrinkled walls are more efficient in the removal of both dyes than carbon particles with worm‐like shapes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates the carbonization of cotton gin trash (CGT) into carbon structures shaped under the influence of different operating conditions including the impact of endogenous fatty acids impurities present in CGT. As expected, both KOH activation and high carbonization temperature increase the material surface area and porosity. Furan and arene groups are formed from 400 °C to 800 °C but the proportion of the furan groups are highest at 600 °C. This is due to the conversion of the fatty acids in CGT to furan units. XRD data reveals the presence of three aromatic layers at 400 °C, followed by structural rearrangement to the formation of five stacks aromatic layers at 800 °C consisting mainly of protonated and non‐protonated condensed arene groups. Interestingly, a reduction in the number of aromatic structures is observed if no acid pretreatment of CGT to remove inorganic impurities is conducted prior to pyrolysis to 600 °C. Two potential applications of the synthesised carbons are shown; one for the formation of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (80%) from fructose, which compares favorably to other porous carbon materials produced under harsher conditions, and another derived CGT carbon material which shows a good uptake of hydrogen for storage.",

Conventional approach to developing such cathode relies on the lithium‐excess materials to operate the cathode at high voltage and extract more lithium‐ion. Yet, they fail to satiate the needs because of their unresolved issues upon cycling such as, for lithium manganese‐rich layered oxides—their voltage fading, and for as nickel‐based layered oxides—the structural transition. Here, in contrast, lithium‐deficient ratio is demonstrated as a new approach to attain high capacity at high voltage for layered oxide cathodes. Rapid and cost effective lithiation of a porous hydroxide precursor with lithium deficient ratio is acted as a driving force to partially convert the layered material to spinel phase yielding in a multiphase structure (MPS) cathode material. Upon cycling, MPS reveals structural stability at high voltage and high temperature and results in fast lithium‐ion diffusion by providing a distinctive solid electrolyte interface (SEI) chemistry—MPS displays minimum lithium loss in SEI and forms a thinner SEI. MPS thus offers high energy and high power applications and provides a new perspective compared to the conventional layered cathode materials denying the focus for lithium excess material.",

A methodology combining the exhaustive microstructural characterization and the careful study of each component of the electrochemical process is established to discuss the limiting factors of power performances. Intuitions based on the exhaustive microstructural characterization are first confronted with the study, by cyclic voltammetry, of the rate‐limiting step of the electrochemical process. Depending on the microstructure, diffusion controlled electrochemical behavior is observed, which is expected in Li‐ion battery, and also charge‐transfer limitation even at extremely high scan rates. This second behavior surprisingly occurs for high surface area materials. Possible electronic limitations in these materials are explored using broadband dielectric spectroscopy. This unique technique shows that flake‐shaped, highly anisotropic, crystallites facilitate electronic motion at all scale levels compared to cuboidal crystallites. Charge‐transfer limitations are not electronic, but come from the material interface contribution to the electrochemical process. Numerical simulations allow quantifying the actual electroactive surface area. Between 15% and 30% of the BET surface area, corresponding to the thickness of the crystallites, are actually active.",

The denotative growth of MoS 2 from the internal pore of 2D MOF on the surface effectively prevents its stacking and exposes much more active edge sites. Experimental results show that parts of Co are incorporated into MoS 2 , producing strong electronic interaction between Co and Mo atoms and accounting for the excellent HER activity of MoS 2 .

In this work, PW from these two sources is successfully converted into a microporous sorbent that is highly selective to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) adsorption. The synthesis of the sorbent is achieved by the pyrolysis of PW in the presence of a potassium salt activator. The properties of the sorbent can be tuned by changing the parent plastic type to get varying degrees of microporosity, surface area, and nitrogen content. The best performer, a sorbent derived from nylon 6,12, had a CO 2 uptake of 19 wt% (4.32 mmol g −1 ) and 5 wt% (1.1 mmol g −1 ) at 1 and 0.1 bar, respectively. The initial estimated cost of synthesizing the sorbent is ≈$531 tonne −1 of PW making this process economically attractive compared to competitive technologies. The sorbent effectiveness in CO 2 separation is demonstrated from various feeds including simulated flue gas and direct air capture. Thus, this upcycling approach can help to address two environmental challenges: PW pollution and increased atmospheric CO 2 levels.",

Global efforts to secure the genetics of threatened populations using cryopreservation and biobanking are underway but are limited to coral sperm and larvae, available only during brief annual spawning events. Methods to cryopreserve adult coral tissues to enable biobanking activities year‐round are urgently needed, but are challenging due to the presence of a calcium carbonate skeleton and algal symbionts within the tissues, and chill sensitivity. In this study, vitrification and laser nanowarming permitted successful recovery of adult coral tissues in a novel sample type, the single‐polyp microfragment. Fluorescence and confocal microscopy shows clearly defined green fluorescent protein auto‐fluorescence around the polyp mouth post‐warming, with an overall survival rate of 39.7 ± 7.4% at 24 h post‐warming and 23.3 ± 9.7% at 1 month, but relatively few algal symbionts are present in the tissues, indicating poor survival of these cells.

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar‐driven water evaporation is considered one of the most promising technologies to simultaneously address the energy crisis and freshwater scarcity. Developing efficient evaporators is highly sought after. Here, a strategy to realize the rapid polymerization of pyrrole and the uniform deposition of carbon dots‐polypyrrole (CDs‐PPy) on Balsa substrate is reported by using CDs solution obtained from the exfoliation of coal pitch with HCOOH/H 2 O 2 as the trigger. This unreacted HCOOH/H 2 O 2 in CDs solution, which gets well reused, can act as the oxidant to oxidize pyrrole, and also play a certain role in removing unstable hemicellulose from Balsa that produces more pores on cell walls. This method also avoids the formation of large PPy aggregates and enables CDs to be incorporated into the polymeric PPy. The obtained Balsa supported CDs‐PPy (CDs‐PPy/Balsa) with high uniformity well preserves the interconnected microporous structure of Balsa. Compared to Balsa supported PPy (PPy/Balsa) synthesized via the conventional polymerization method of pyrrole using ammonium persulfate as an oxidant in HCl aqueous medium, the obtained CDs‐PPy/Balsa evaporator with high physicochemical stability and salt resistance ability shows superior solar‐driven water evaporation performance. These favorable features can lead CDs‐PPy/Balsa to a greater use in practical solar‐driven water evaporation applications.",

High ionic flux sub‐micro channels membrane can offer a high current density for salinity gradient power generation with a significant power output. Herein, based on numerical simulation model with Poisson‐Nernst‐Planck‐Navier‐Stokes (PNP‐NS) equations, a high ionic flux sub‐micro channel model with assumption is introduced that measured current is contributed by Cl − ionic flux across the membrane. An ion channel system is built for experiment, in which a glass membrane with regular symmetric sub‐micro cylindrical channels and high effective channel area is applied, ion conductance and salinity gradient energy conversion property are tested. This PNP‐NS equations model simulation fits experiment well, its mechanism is also studied by the model. In addition, by mixing artificial sea water (0.5 m NaCl) and river water (0.01 m m NaCl), the output power density of this 50‐fold salinity gradient system can achieve 4.16 W m −2 , and the highest output power density will be up to 7.91 W m −2 under a 0.5 m /0.001 m 500‐fold salinity gradient.

In terms of Li + storage, not only the typical intercalation reaction of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 can be fully carried out, but also the Li + storage in the form of pseudocapacitance can be introduced due to its porous structure, thus the enhanced Li + storage mechanism can be realized and the reversible capacity in the work (197 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 ) break the bottleneck of 175 mAh g −1 for Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . In terms of electrochemical reaction kinetics, its plate‐like shape effectively avoids agglomeration of particles reducing the charge transfer resistance, and the micropores increase the diffusion rate of Li + (3.3 times faster than the commercial Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 nanoparticles). During the practical test, it can maintain the reversible capacity of 134 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles at the huge current density of 1.0 A g −1 and show good compatibility with commercial LiFePO 4 cathode, which proves its great practical potential for LIBs.",

Compared with normal bulk sulfur, the electrochemistry behaviors of sulfur chains inside single‐wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have rarely been investigated. Herein, one type of 1D sulfur chain encapsulated in SWCNTs (S@SWCNTs) is designed as the cathode for Li–S batteries. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the suppressed shuttle effect and the accelerated sulfur reduction kinetics in S@SWCNTs cathodes, benefiting from the spatial confinement effect of SWCNTs. The S@SWCNTs electrode possesses an excellent rate performance and highly reversible discharge capacity of 1123 mAh g −1 at 1 C with 0.07% capacity fade rate per cycle over 500 cycles. Moreover, the S@SWCNTs as the self‐supporting cathodes can still exhibit capacity retention of 94% after 100 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 5.84 mg cm −2 and low E/S (electrolyte/sulfur) ratio of 4.3 µL mg −1 , promising for high energy‐density full batteries. This work helps the understanding of sulfur chain redox reaction and electrochemistry behaviors inside SWCNTs and provides a path‐breaking vision to develop the cathodes of Li–S batteries.",

The catalyst exhibits benchmark‐close bifunctional activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions.

Introducing a uniform interfacial layer that conducts Li + ions while insulating electrons, through atomic layer deposition (ALD) of lithium compounds, has shown promise in facilitating lithium ion transport and enhancing interface stability. However, synthesizing lithium compounds with both robust chemical stability and a broad electrochemical window using ALD poses challenges due to the difficulty of obtaining desired products under specific ALD reaction conditions. In this study, this challenge by investigating Li 3 PO 4 is addressed, a compound grown by ALD that exhibits a noteworthy property: the in situ formation of a more stable LiPO 3 phase under high applied voltage. The LiPO 3 phase possesses an extended theoretical stability window (LiPO 3 : 2.48‐5.00 V versus Li 3 PO 4 : 0.69‐4.21 V), and its emergence substantially enhances the electrochemical performance of all‐solid‐state lithium batteries based on polyethylene oxide (PEO). This work not only presents experimental evidence of the in situ transformation of the interfacial layer but also offers a pragmatic approach to realizing all‐solid‐state lithium batteries with elevated energy density, emphasizing safety and stability considerations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract High‐energy sodium (Na)‐metal batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high theoretical capacity and abundant Na resources. However, the development of room‐temperature Na metal anodes faces several significant challenges. First, the fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and highly reactive nature of Na metal cause continuous consumption of electrolytes. Furthermore, Na dendrite growth is more vigorous than the Li counterpart due to the unstable SEI, leading to rapid decay in Coulombic efficiency and short‐circuit issues. Additionally, volume expansion and the generation of flammable gases during Na plating and stripping are significant issues in practical Na metal batteries. This review provides a comprehensive summary of proposed solutions aimed at addressing these problems, including electrolyte modification design, protective layer implementation, and structured Na‐metal anode development with the goal of achieving a stable interface, reversible Na plating/stripping processes, and a prolonged cycling lifespan. Furthermore, this review discusses the underlying principles behind these strategies while offering insights into future research directions.",

The method evaluates films that mimic coatings before and after 500 h of accelerated weathering, equivalent to roughly 1 year of outdoor exposure. No noticeable transformation in film appearance is evident with a spectrophotometer following the accelerated weathering. Chemiluminescence analysis indicates oxidative degradation predominantly in the acrylic resin, an impact that the CNFs seem to mitigate. Whereas attenuated total reflectance (ATR)‐Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy commonly identifies chemical changes in visibly degraded coatings, it does not clearly discern prior, inapparent deterioration. In this context, machine learning algorithms (such as k ‐nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)) categorize these nuanced changes by using the absorbance from 400 to 4000 cm −1 as explanatory variables. The SVM model exhibits the highest predictive accuracy, and the RF recognizes crucial variables in some wavenumber zones. This approach has the potential for enhancing recoating schedules, cutting costs, and encouraging sustainable use of wood.",

To address this issue, an action research project, “Off‐lines”, is launched to investigate people's knowledge and awareness of USB cable e‐waste and take initiatives to raise public awareness of its proper disposal. From February to May 2022, the study conducted a questionnaire survey and received 457 valid responses. The results revealed that each respondent has an average of nine unused USB cables and, based on this finding, it is estimated that there are 57.7 million excessive USB cables in Hong Kong. Such excessive ownership can be driven by the fact that ≈70% of respondents are unaware of the recyclability of USB cables, and the knowledge of USB cable recyclability varies depending on age, income level, and awareness of recycling locations. To resolve the problem, 150 collection points are established throughout Hong Kong and successfully collected over 7 700 unwanted USB cables from the public. Additionally, workshops are conducted that raised public awareness by upcycling this emergent e‐waste. This project highlights the urgent need to expand waste collection, promotion, and educational networks, with a particular focus on the elderly population.",

However, some fabrication techniques are complicated, and it is necessary to develop a simplified and precise control method. Herein, a facile fabrication method is reported for core–shell nanoparticles hierarchically coated with polymeric ionic liquids (PIL) and hydrophobic polymers as a material for polymer electrolytes. A hierarchical polymer layer on the surface of the SiO 2 nanoparticles is easily constructed by repeating the facile polymer‐coating technique based on precipitation polymerization several times. The highest proton conductivity of the core–shell nanoparticles is 1.3 × 10 −2 S cm −1 at 80 °C and 95% relative humidity. Although the hydrophobic polymers coated as a protective layer reduce the proton conductivity, the formation of the PIL enhances the proton conductivity in various temperature and humidity environments. Therefore, the proposed method enables the facile fabrication of polymer layers with multiple functions, such as a proton‐conductive PIL layer and hydrophobic polymer layers as protective layers on the surface of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, they are expected to be applied to energy supply and gas separation, including polyelectrolytes, for the realization of a sustainable society.",

A widely researched approach for synthesizing CN films with controlled optical and photoelectrochemical properties relies on using supramolecular assemblies as the precursors for thermal polymerization over a transparent conductive substrate. However, the formation of supramolecular assemblies is highly dependent on the temperature and solubility in a given solvent, limiting the full potential of this method. Moreover, the intercalation of metal ions is challenging due to the use of polar solvents. Here, this study shows a new way of synthesizing supramolecular assemblies with metal ions using a solvothermal approach.

However, manufactured nanoparticles found in sewage pose a potential risk in MFCs although the extent of this is still unclear. In this study, MFCs using sludge containing two types of nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) as substrates are investigated. It is found that in the MFC start‐up process, the maximum output voltage of the green synthesized nZVI (g‐nZVI) group and chemically synthesized nZVI group (c‐nZVI) decreases to 202.5 mV and 94.7 mV, respectively. Meanwhile the maximum output voltage of the control group is higher than 500 mV. These outcomes are attributed to a high concentration of nZVI being inhibited during the start‐up phase, and nZVI makes no essentially significant change in generating electricity despite MFCs being started successfully. Concerning the results on the rate of removing chemical oxygen demand, scanning electron microscope, and electrochemical characterization indicate that green synthesized nZVI, compared to chemically synthesized nZVI, reveals less antibacterial activity to microbial community in anode. The electronic properties of MFCs are lightly affected due to the mature biofilm adhering to the anode's electrode surface. Finally, nZVI can effectively extend and stabilize the output voltage of the produced electricity by releasing Fe 3+ ions.",

The float‐sink test is conducted to understand the gravity separation performance, and the results show that a 47% yield at 86% organic content with 70% combustible recovery can be obtained using dense media separation. The washability behavior of NMF is assessed using different washability indices standard in the coal industry; and the material is classified as difficult‐to‐clean. The float‐sink products show the concentration of organic stream in −1.8 g cm −3 range, fiberglass in +2.0–2.5 g cm −3 range, and metals in +2.5 g cm −3 range. The recovery of these components will facilitate the concept of the circular economy and promote sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Two of the main problems of society in the near future are the access to clean water and energy. In particular, organic pollutants can be a major health threat. Within available methods, a trade‐off can be established between the pollutant treatment price and the final pollutant concentration that can be achieved. In this paper, a water treatment device is proposed in order to decouple these two variables. It consists of a BiVO 4 photoanode combined with a thin film silicon solar cell. BiVO 4 is an earth‐abundant material with a bandgap energy of 2.4 eV. Here, its good catalytic properties are shown for the degradation of phenol and chloroform when combined with an external bias voltage of 1 V versus Ag/AgCl. In addition, to cover the voltage needs, an a‐Si:H/nc‐Si:H solar cell has been coupled with the BiVO 4 photoanode. This solar cell has been specifically designed to work under the transmitted spectrum of BiVO 4 , with thicknesses of 300 and 2000 nm for the top and bottom cell, respectively. This device has successfully been fabricated, and tested for removal of organic contaminants from an aqueous solution, performing even better than the BiVO 4 photoanode alone with a similar external bias voltage applied.",

For example, the absence of metals in the catalytic site, and the easy design for optimization. The incorporation of multiple functionalities in pseudopeptidic macrocycles with a pendant arm allows catalytic systems to be obtained where halide anions (nucleophilic activating agents for epoxides), hydrogen bond acceptor sites (activating agents for epoxides and stabilizing sites for anionic intermediates), and amine groups (Lewis basic sites for activating CO 2 ) are in proximity. This allows a high activity in the cycloaddition of CO 2 to styrene oxide under mild conditions (turnover number (TON) = 900, CO 2 balloon, 100 °C, 5 h). The primary amino groups in the arm facilitate the immobilization of these macrocyclic structures in cross‐linked polymeric matrices containing ammonium halide fragments. Such multifunctional insoluble polymers afford excellent catalytic results with high TON and turnover frequency values and remarkable productivities (&gt;10 g prod g resin −1 h −1 ). This activity is maintained for a variety of epoxides and is retained after several catalytic runs. Their performance is significantly higher than those reported for most heterogenous supramolecular catalytic systems for CO 2 transformation into carbonates.",

The performance of CuCeAlO x is correlated with its high reducibility and acidity. Cu sintering and biogenic impurity poisoning are identified as possible deactivation mechanisms over 60 h of continuous testing. The gasoline‐range SCM‐DHDO products are comprised of primarily aliphatic alcohols that result in improved energy density and favorably reduced vapor pressure, relative to ethanol, with the tradeoff of nonsynergistic octane blending with conventional gasoline and lower oxidation stability. Overall, this work highlights the potential to produce suitable light oxygenates by SCM‐DHDO processing for gasoline bioblendstock applications.",

Herein, a facile method of devising the shrinkage of three‐dimension (3D) hot spots droplets on a hydrophobic array substrate is demonstrated for the quantitative and multiplex detection of pesticide residues by using a portable Raman spectrometer. The shrunk droplet which is consisted of the analyte solution and AgNPs sol can induce simultaneously increasing density of plasmonic hot spots and immobilizing target molecules in hot spots. Besides, the closely packed Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) are anchored in the gaps of the MoS 2 nanosheet array, generating uniform hotspots distribution with relative standard deviation (RSD) of about 8 %. In addition, the synergetic effects between MoS 2 and AgNPs further enhance the SERS sensitivity, and thereby target molecules of 10 −9 m are readily detected. Besides, the proposed strategy exhibits excellent SERS sensitivity for the analysis of pesticides down to 10 −8 m . Importantly, quantitative analysis and multi‐components detection of pesticide residues on honeysuckle surface are achieved. Therefore, it is expected to be used for quantitative analysis of complex pesticide systems on real samples.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Carbon is an established electrode material in electrochemical reactors, e.g., for the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Common structures are graphite felts or carbon fibers. These materials usually lack adequate electrochemical activity, hence more selectively active moieties need to be introduced. Furthermore, the commonly porous materials require immobilization concepts which normally include polymeric binders that partly block the porous surface and may entail secondary pollution. This work introduces carbon nanofibers (CNFs), synthesized on nickel foams via catalytic carbon decomposition, as a novel, binder‐free electrode with two‐level porosity. The fibers are in the range of few nanometers and comprise embedded nickel nanoparticles (30–250 nm). The CNFs are deposited as a thin layer on a nickel foam, not affecting its intrinsically open‐porous nature. The as‐synthesized CNF/Ni foams show H 2 O 2 production rates as high as 1.1 mg h −1 cm −2 at pH 3 and a cathodic potential of 0.11 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) through multiple reaction pathways catalyzed by CNF and embedded nickel nanoparticles. In an electro‐Fenton process, the removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), a frequently detected micropollutant in water bodies is assessed, demonstrating an almost complete depletion after 10 min (c CBZ,0 = 4 mg L −1 ). These results unveil the potential of the integrated production of CNF/Ni foam electrodes with scale‐up perspectives for oxygen reduction reactions.",

There is today a necessity of strategies for urban resilience. These move away from the idea that space must be used in the most efficient way possible: instead, tolerances will be built in, buffers formed, which should lead at the same time to added spatially quantitative value. It is as right as it is necessary to develop a vision of climate‐friendly and CO 2 ‐neutral cities and regions. On the one hand, one must ask how all of the uncertainties can be handled in the planning. On the other hand, one must engage oneself to anchor—more precisely, to better anchor—integrated climate protection and adaptation strategies to everyday activities: not only for regional planning or urban development, but also among private builders and property owners.",

It is found that a total of ≈800% OER activity tunability can be achieved by only ≈0.4% in situ strain modulation. Then the variation of in‐plane interaction strength of the e g orbital is found to correspond to the sensitive OER tunability and 3dx 2 − y 2 orbital occupancy is favored in an OER enhancement of LSMO.",

This is the first demonstration of large‐area SD coated organic photochromic films and UV filters. Impressively, highly uniform photochromic films comprised of small molecules are formed in air, from green solvents (i.e., alcohols) and show rapid color changes upon external stimuli (i.e., light and heat). The UV filters processed under the same conditions and comprised of only small molecules show highly transparent films in the visible and near‐IR range with T % &gt; 97%@550 nm and excellent UV blocking ability. The work highlights the utility of roll‐to‐roll compatible SD‐coating methods to make prototype organic devices in an academic laboratory setting and opens the door for additive manufacturing of simple and low‐cost UV active films for healthcare and electronic applications.",

    "abstract": "Global warming and climate change are major challenges facing our society in the 21st century. Both are mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels to supply energy. The adoption of renewable energies will play a pivotal role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy technologies are crucial for realizing sustainable development. This special issue, published in collaboration with Advanced Materials Technologies, presents comprehensive reviews and discussions on the topics related to renewable energy technologies for advanced sustainable systems: i) Lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries, lithium(sodium)-carbon dioxide batteries and sodium-ion capacitors, ii) methanol fuel cells and microbial fuel cells for electricity generation, iii) Perovskite solar cells and solar-redox flow batteries, iv) layered materials for thermoelectric energy, and v) global artificial photosynthesis and renewable energy storage for the sustainocene. Rechargeable batteries are widely considered as the key technology for the renewable energy industry because sources of renewable energy are intermittent and depend on weather conditions to generate electricity. Therefore, this renewable power must be stored and delivered when the electricity network is in demand. On the other hand, rechargeable batteries are also crucial for the electric vehicle industry, in particular for autonomous vehicles. This issue summarizes cathode materials for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, in-situ techniques to characterize failure mechanisms of lithium-ion batteries, electrolytes for lithium-oxygen batteries, perspectives of Li(Na)CO2 batteries, and cell configuration and electrode materials for non-aqueous sodium-ion supercapacitors. Solar redox flow batteries combine photoelectrochemical cells and redox flow batteries as one integrated system, which are capable for large-scale real-time electricity storage and conversion. A review in this issue discusses all aspects of the working mechanism, device engineering and performance evaluation of novel solar redox flow battery systems. Fuel-cells (FCs) are electrochemical devices that can directly convert chemical energy of fuels such as hydrogen and methanol to electricity. A critical review in this special issue covers high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. In a similar way microbial fuel cells (MFC) can be used to generate electrical power from municipal waste sludge, which is shown in a research article. It was found that the maximum output voltage was affected by the nanoscale zerovalent iron during the start-up process. Perovskite solar-cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive interests owing to their high energy conversion efficiency and facile solution processability for fabrication. As part of this special issue, recent progress of PSCs is reviewed with an emphasis on low-cost manufacturing and extending long-term service life. Artificial photosynthesis (AP) for renewable energy conversion and storage can achieve ultimate long-term sustainability. An Essay looks at the developments of integrating AP with an analysis on the advantages and disadvantages of this technology. It has been an absolute joy and pleasure to edit this special issue. I would like to thank the editor of Advanced Sustainable System, Dr. Till von Graberg, for coordinating the special issue and handling all papers. I would like to sincerely thank all authors for their high quality contributions to this special issues.

    "abstract": "Abstract A switch for controlling hydrogen bonds is incorporated into a polymer‐based system of polyamine polycation and polyacrylamide, with an ultrahigh molecular weight of 18 million; a surprising process results whereby the apparent viscosity of the whole system suddenly plunges from 321 cps to below 6.5 cps, forming a new water‐like phase state (WLPS) of an H‐bonded polymer‐based system. When WLPS products are used as decolorant materials to purify dyeing wastewater, they can flow similar to water during mass transfer and be quickly dissolved, immediately interacting with the anionic dyes in water. This observation is the first of a sudden change in apparent viscosity and the formation of a water‐like state in a polymer‐based system. Moreover, due to the switch effect to control hydrogen bonds, WLPS decolorants can change from water‐like states to strong hydrogen bonding states after interacting with anionic dyes, thus increasing the attractive forces of formed flocs to realize the instantaneous and highly adaptable decolorization of dyeing wastewater. It only took 10 s for the WLPS decolorants to remove more than 95% of various dyes in dyeing wastewater. Subsequently, a series of new cohesive floc structure–forms are first discovered by a computer imaging optical microscope.",

In the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of alkylphenols, hydroxyl groups must be removed while avoiding the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring. Here, the HDO of propylphenols is studied using a Pt/Nb 2 O 5 catalyst and n ‐tetradecane solvent. HDO experiments are performed using different reaction conditions of batch residence time (0–161 min g cat g reactant −1 ), pressure (20–30 bar H 2 ), and temperature (300–375 °C). HDO is studied with ortho‐ , meta‐ , and para ‐propylphenol. The influence of vapor–liquid equilibrium and chemical equilibrium are assessed using thermodynamic calculations. Almost full deoxygenation is attained in the experiments; the main products are propylbenzene and propylcyclohexane. The study finds that, of the isomers, 4‐propylphenol is the most favorable for forming propylbenzene (77% maximum selectivity), whereas 2‐propylphenol is the least favorable (55% maximum selectivity). Additionally, the reactivity of propylbenzene in the test conditions is detrimental to its selectivity after 5 min g cat g reactant −1 . Finally, the temperature at which the process favors propylbenzene is found to shift as a function of pressure; at 20 bar, propylbenzene is favored at 350 °C and at 30 bar, it is favored at 375 °C.",

These three catalysts, characterized by relatively small mean particle size (i.e., 4.44 ± 2.18 nm for AuPt, 6.42 ± 3.31 nm for AuPd, and 6.91 ± 3.97 nm for AgPt), enable complete glycerol (GLY) conversion after 4 h of reaction at room temperature, under atmospheric pressure (200 mL of a 0.3 m GLY solution, 0.5 g of catalyst, NaOH/GLY = 4 mol mol −1 , 1500 rpm, 650 mL O 2 min −1 ). Moreover, it is possible to achieve more than 80% GLY conversion after 4 h of reaction at room temperature under atmospheric pressure with air bubbling (650 mL air min −1 ) as an oxidation atmosphere.

    "abstract": "Abstract Immobilization and reuse of CO 2 are urgent tasks for sustaining the global environment. Here it is demonstrated that CO 2 can be immobilized by reaction with H 2 O at room temperature (RT) in the specific sub‐nm space of 1D uneven‐structured C 60 polymer (1D polymer) film, even though the reaction does not occur at RT in the gas phase (activation energy: 2 eV). First‐principles calculations reveal that the CO 2 molecule is stacked as a bridge between the concave portions of adjacent 1D polymer frameworks via locally induced Coulomb interactions. Such induced charge polarization activates CO 2 both by weakening its double‐bonds and by lowering its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy due to the bending motion. In addition, the flexible π orbitals of the 1D polymer provide the optimal Coulomb field to stabilize the transition state of the CO 2 + H 2 O reaction remarkably. These factors work together to make the reaction possible at RT.",

Intriguingly, hemoglobin enhances the exothermically oxidative process of the laccase reaction. Product characterizations suggest that hemoglobin may preferentially reduce the ratio of guaiacyl/syringyl subunits and promote phenylcoumaran formation simultaneously. The complicated interactions among hemoglobin, laccase, and lignin make a multiple‐component reaction, suggesting that Fe‐containing macromolecules have the capacity to mediate laccase based chemical modifications of lignin.",

    "abstract": "This special issue of the journal Advanced Sustainable Systems focuses on green electronics. The field of green electronics includes scientists, engineers and technologists from academia, national labs and industry as well as manufacturers, consultants, non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations, industry-government-academia consortia, policy makers and community networks working to limit the impact of electronics and their powering elements (e.g. batteries) on the environment and human health. The special issue includes a perspective, article number 2100046, of extreme interest to explain why the circular economy will drive green and sustainable chemistry in electronics. Considering the depletion of a number of chemical endangered elements and the accumulation of e-waste, it is pertinent and timely to study materials that are electrochemically and electronically active, based on abundant chemical elements, such as carbon, can be synthesized through green processes (e.g. by employing green solvents and synthesis waste disposal recipes) and can go through efficient techniques for recycling. This special issue includes a valuable set of reviews that establish the state-of-the-art in environmental and human friendly materials for electronics, bioelectronics and photonics (silk- and paper-based materials for green photonics and electronics, in article number 2000216, ion-conducting hydrogels for bioelectronics, in article number 2100173, and biocompatible and biodegradable conductive polymer composites, in article number 2100075) as well as novel device end-of-life scenarios where transient electronics (totally disintegrable) are discussed in terms of sustainability (article number 2100057). Natural (biosourced) and naturally derived organic materials are discussed for a broad range of applications. Electrochemical energy storage based on the biopigment sepia melanin and graphitic carbon quantum dots is reported in article number 2100152. Naturally derived organic dyes for light emitting diodes are reported in article number 2000300. Article number 2100048 combines knowledge in plant physiology and nanotechnology by reporting on a prototypical conjugated polymer regulating signalling in plants. The use of green solvents is discussed in article number 2100055, in the context of slot-die coated organic UV indicators and filters, as well as in article number 2100078, for the processing of electron extraction layers of inverted organic solar cells featuring increased stability. Exciting reports deal with materials for organic light-emitting diode substrates based on bacterial cellulose modified with recycled polystyrene, in article number 2000258, high-performance bionylons from itaconic and amino acids with pepsin degradability, in article number 2100052, and electronic platforms based on poly(glycerol sebacic) acrylate combining elastomeric stretchability and biodegradability, in article number 2100035. Sustainable end-of-life scenarios are also discussed in the special issue. Studies on the thermal degradation of waste printed circuit boards in view of their recycling are reported in article number 2100054 whereas article number 2000231 assesses the applicability of gravity separation to recycle the non-metal fraction of waste printed circuit boards. Biodegradable poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/clay composites as multifunctional electronic materials are discussed in article number 2100056. Self-healing extends the useful lifetime of materials and as such favors their sustainability. Self-healable and stretchable soft microfluidics are reported in article number 2100074. The thoughtful contributions of this special issue are meant to promote a circular vision in electronics. Hopefully the case studies and technological solutions reported in this special issue will help to identify key challenges to be overcome by the electronics industry to implement such circular vision.

    "abstract": "Abstract 1,2‐diketone‐based naphthalimide has emerged as an important electron‐withdrawing building block in the synthesis of organic semiconductor assemblies for a wide range of applications. The reaction with different diamine derivatives enables the formation of pyrazine linkers which promotes planarity and rigidity of the naphthalimide‐based semiconductors, therefore tunning their electronic structure and processability. Despite the significant use of this versatile building block to generate flat and rigid assemblies, the correlation between rigidity and dimensionality in these systems and their photocatalytic activity remains unexplored so far. Herein, with the aim to modulate the photocatalytic activity of these materials, a new family of assemblies with different dimensionality end‐capped with naphthalimide moieties are developed in which one ( NIPB ), three ( 3NIPT ), and four ( 4NIPTM ) units have been selectively introduced. The good processability of these novel semiconductors combined with their suitable energy levels allows their application as photo‐electrocatalysts for the degradation of organic dyes and for water splitting. The derivative with the highest dimensionality, 4NIPTM , shows higher photo‐electrocatalytic activity and lower charge transfer resistance than that of conventional semiconductors (such as TiO 2 and C 3 N 4 ), reaching photocurrents up to 20 µA cm −2 .",

The liquid fraction hydrolysate (LFH) obtained after filtration of the steam-exploded slurry (previously subjected to detoxification) and the enzymatic hydrolysate resulting from the water insoluble solid fraction (WIS-derived hydrolysate, WDH) are studied as substrate for lactic acid fermentation using an integrated strategy. The fermentation process of WDH using Bacillus coagulans and Lactobacillus rhamnosus shows similar sugar conversion yields of about 0.9 g g−1 (based on consumed glucose). In contrast, the use of detoxified LFH (d-LFH) completely inhibits B. coagulans, making necessary a previous dilution with the WDH to trigger fermentation when using this microorganism. The best integrated strategy using both d-LFH and WDH streams and B. coagulans as fermentative strain has a 1:3 d-LFH:WDH ratio, yielding 0.93 g lactic acid g−1 of consumed sugars and a lactic acid concentration of about 50 g L−1.",

Kirigami envelopes with reflective surfaces offer a promising option to reduce indoor heat gain. So far none has performed outdoor testing of kirigami envelopes nor numerical simulation to understand how they interact with the environment. To understand the impact of the geometric design of the kirigami shading system on both daylighting and temperature variation in the indoor environment, a series of prototypes and simulations is devised to investigate the real‐time shading behavior in an outdoor environment. Large‐scaled and silver‐coated kirigami‐based envelopes of different cut patterns and stretching ratios are fabricated and placed in front of custom‐designed chambers equipped with six thermo‐sensors. Simulation is performed to investigate the effect of light modulation and hence temperature inside the chamber, which corroborates with the experiments. The indoor daylighting pattern and temperature are significantly influenced by the geometry of the stretched kirigami envelope, and overall, both the indoor temperature and the spatial distribution of illuminance are more uniform compared with that without the kirigami envelope. These results indicate that the installation of kirigami envelopes can improve building energy saving and occupants’ comfort.",

In an attempt to recover water from highly contaminated industrial wastewater, researchers have relied on developing various materials that can treat polluted water efficiently and sustainably. 3D printed materials have proved to be an emerging technology in water treatment. 2D materials have recently enhanced filter technology due to their morphological properties. This study focuses on removing salinity and organic dyes utilizing 2D Gadolinium telluride (Gd 2 Te 3 ) coated 3D printed (2D@3DP) complex architecture. The 2D@3DP structure can potentially increase the contact time of adsorbed saline water due to its complex architecture and can remove ≈52% salinity from brackish water. Furthermore, methylene blue (MB) and Methyl Orange (MO) removal efficiencies are ≈69% and 45%, respectively. Spectroscopic and microscopic results confirm the adsorption of negatively charged chlorine ions on a positively charged 2D surface. The removal of bleaching powder is also tested for real‐life applications, and ≈20% of the bleaching powder is adsorbed. Moreover, the 2D@3DP device exhibits an electrical signal due to impinging sodium chloride droplets from different heights, making it a sustainable solution to address water pollution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study introduces a novel approach by developing cellulose nanopapers derived from pineapple pomace and impregnated with cinnamon essential oil (CEO) in the range of 1–5 wt.%. This innovative material aims to enhance the shelf life of coriander leaves through antibacterial packaging. Comparative analyses encompassed structural, crystalline, morphological, physico‐mechanical, water barrier, permeability, and antibacterial properties against control samples. Incorporating CEO yielded a reduction in crystallinity index and tensile strength, attributed to a plasticizing effect. The addition of 5 wt.% CEO led to a remarkable 46% increase in elongation at break. Enhanced thermal stability, with a T max rise of 26 °C, is attributed to hydrogen bonding between CEO and cellulose molecules. The nanopapers exhibited notable reductions in oxygen and water vapor transmission rates (24% and 32% respectively) compared to control nanopapers. Impressive antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli is observed. These developed nanopapers are applied as active packaging for coriander leaves, extending their shelf life by up to 3 and 15 days without and with refrigeration. Moreover, chlorophyll, carotenoid, and moisture content in coriander leaves stored with CEO‐loaded nanopapers remained akin to fresh leaves. Thus, this study presents an environmentally friendly antibacterial packaging solution with potential for sustainable application.",

This study explores heat‐related physiological and psychological impacts, symptoms, and demographic determinants based on 4210 questionnaires across nine large Chinese cities, including Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Nanjing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Xi'an in August 2020. The results indicate that heat‐related psychological impacts are equally severe as physiological impacts. Chongqing is under the most severe heat‐related health impact on both the physiological and psychological aspects. Skin heat damage (SKI), digestive system illnesses (DIG), respiratory illnesses (RES), and cardiovascular illnesses (CAR) are prominent physiological illnesses in all cities, while emotional irritability (EMO), easy to lose control temper (EAS), low mood (LOW), and insomnia (INS) are prominent psychological symptoms. Chongqing and Guangzhou are the most vulnerable cities in terms of physiological and psychological symptoms. Chengdu, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Shanghai are more resilient in terms of physiological symptoms, whereas Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Shanghai are more resistant to psychological symptoms. Heat‐related health impacts, symptoms, and demographic determinants are spatially heterogeneous. The elderly and patients are more vulnerable, while such a conclusion is not always true. The spatial heterogeneity of heat‐related physiological and psychological impacts, symptoms, and drivers highlights the significance of developing city‐specific heat health action plans.",

    "abstract": "It has taken quite some time to raise collective awareness of the fact that all actions have an environmental impact and that there is a pressing need to find ways to mitigate these impacts in order to create a sustainable future. The 17 global challenges for humanity, as identified by the Millennium Project and the UN Climate Change Conferences, only further emphasize the urgency with which these issues should be addressed. As a result of this, new fields of study are being established at universities: building sustainability programs including green campuses, offices, and labs, and more and more research grants with significantly increased funding have been initiated in recent years, which also include environmental and sustainability aspects, such as Horizon 2020 (80 bn € by 2020) by the EU and EC, or UN. The implication of this is that in the future much more original research will be carried out in cross-disciplinary areas, but with a common aim: To enable a sustainable future. In this regard, we realize that a key publication platform bringing together isolated research disciplines under one roof is urgently needed and with Advanced Sustainable Systems we are now planting a seed with unique characteristics in the scholarly publishing landscape. This new journal provides an unparalleled, global forum for exchange of opinion and original research results, putting us in a position to tackle sustainable development from multiple angles. A dire need for more sustainable development has also been recognized in industry, where broad sustainability and corporate social responsibility strategies have been enacted by many companies operating on a global scale. How to allocate limited resources to generate revenue, but also to conserve the environment in order to secure future revenue, at the same time, is a very important question in many industry sectors. The general problem in this regard is the lack of data. Engineers, for example, often have sound experience and a proven track record of well-established data on how to build an artificial dam. However, the influence of man-made buildings on the surrounding environment, fauna, and flora, is often less understood due to a lack of reliable data. In this regard Advanced Sustainable Systems will act as an enabler to provide the critical missing data on complex interdisciplinary subjects related to topics such as sustainable building, resource efficient production, and advanced research on more efficient and less consumptive technologies for energy, healthcare, electronics, water, food sustainability, and environmental aspects, as well as its implications for the policymaking domain and for human wellbeing in general. Advanced Sustainable Systems will be backed by an Executive Advisory Board consisting of internationally established thought leaders from diverse backgrounds: The current, first issue of the journal already shows its full potential by publishing topics such as clean water through solar steam generation, food packaging, sustainable electrochemical energy storage, and photo-electrochemical production of hydrogen and valuable oxidation products. These topics rank highly among the greatest challenges of our time, and will continue to influence the global community. These are just the first steps of the journal to enable humanity (and those working on planning projects around the world) to take the next steps toward greater sustainability with confidence. Submit your exciting research to Advanced Sustainable Systems now, and enjoy reading! The Editorial Team of Advanced Sustainable Systems",

These materials are effective electrodes consisting of high surface-area CN containing CNT fiber fabrics acting as a scaffold and a highly conducting built-in current collector. The results confirm that CNTs act as nucleation centers for the formation of CN films, forming close contact at the CN/CNT interphase, and resulting in efficient charge transfer upon illumination and enhanced electrochemical surface area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lithium‐metal batteries (LMBs) have long been considered the “holy grail” of next‐generation energy storage systems due to the unique advantages of Li metal, such as having a high specific capacity and the lowest potential. Unfortunately, the practical application of LMBs is seriously hindered by the uncontrollable growth of dendritic Li. To address this issue, a positively charged layer (PCL) with freely moving multication sidechains is successfully polymerized on a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator. The cationic groups on the sidechains of the polymer realize dendrite‐free Li deposition based on the “dynamic tip‐occupying electrostatic shield” effect. LMBs with improved cycling stability and rate performance can be achieved by using a PP‐ N,N,N,N”,N ”‐pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PP‐PMDT) separator. All the results demonstrate that this strategy for constructing a flexible “electrostatic shield layer” can successfully eliminate the formation of Li dendrites while retaining the desired performance.",

    "abstract": "The troubling reports of the increasing CO2 emissions in 2017 are in and taken together with the recent political developments across the globe, further highlight the need for intensified research into climate change mitigation as one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Advanced Sustainable Systems embarked on a mission to publish the best and the most important research results and concepts, addressing one or more of the SDGs in: Climate action (SDG 13), Renewable energy (SDG 7), Sustainable food and agriculture (SDGs 2, 3), Urban development and sustainable living (SDGs 9, 11), Ecology (SDGs 6, 14, 15), Cradle-to-cradle processing (SDG 12), Social and economic challenges (SDGs 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16) and Policy and governance (SDGs 16,17). For details, please go to “Aims & Scope” of our journal. While the majority of the contributions published in Advanced Sustainable Systems so far address recent developments in the fields of renewable and sustainable energy, we are gradually publishing a broader topical spectrum, thus, covering more of the mentioned SDGs. This is reflected in the upcoming special issues in 2018 covering diverse topics such as renewable energy technologies, natural hazards and biodiversity. So far, researchers from China and the United States have made the largest contribution to the journal, followed by authors from Australia, Japan, Canada, Germany, India, Italy, and the Netherlands (see Figure). We would like to highlight a few papers of high interest from the areas of energy, environment, and cradle-to-cradle with applications in energy. Dendrite growth is a challenging problem for batteries with lithium metal electrodes. Researchers from the Manthiram group at the University of Texas showed that by simply wrapping Li electrodes in a Kimwipe paper dendrite growth can be suppressed, leading to significantly improved stability and cyclability.1 Solving the problem of the ever increasing frequency of flood and drought periods is vital since more than 40% of the world's population is affected by clean water scarcity (addressed in SDG #6). Fratalocchi and co-workers from KAUST2 have come up with a really innovative idea. They loaded super-dark nanoparticles on a spongy substrate which can float on water and by converting solar radiation into heat, seawater could be transformed into clean water steam. In addition, the whole system is recyclable and can be produced on a large scale. Another major environmental concern is the overwhelming accumulation of plastic waste. 269 million tons of plastic were produced worldwide in 2015, with 50 million tons of that within the EU. 40% of this amount was for product packaging. Although the recycling rate of packaging is the highest of all plastic products, in the EU it measures to less than 40%. Gao, Richards and co-workers from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology reviewed the recent advances in the efficient and complete sorting of plastic waste.3 In addition to publishing the very best of scientific research, one of the first milestones in the history of a young journal is its inclusion in the major indexing services. We are happy to announce that Advanced Sustainable Systems has been included in the Web of Science (the Emerging Sources Citation Index), which is an important step for increased discoverability and accessibility. Equipped with many great ideas and a fantastic feedback from our board members, authors and reviewers, we look forward to further developing Advanced Sustainable Systems, after a very promising start. We would like to thank all who made this journal a success and to offer you the chance to get complimentary access to the next volume of Advanced Sustainable Systems!",

The fabricated photocathodes exhibit excellent performances in photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction due to the advantages of 3D MoS2, which reduces the overpotential of Si photocathode by abundant edge sites exposed to the ambient and increases the absorption of sun light by antireflection effect.

In this landscape, expandable polystyrene (EPS) is the dominant choice; however, the waste management of EPS is hampered by recycling challenges and lack of economic incentives. Concurrently, the order delivery and pharmaceutical distribution have experienced significant growth due to lifestyle shifts after the pandemic. For instance, the utilization of drones for transportation is illustrated (see abstract figure) as a prospective alternative transportation protocol. In this work, a synthetic method is developed to prepare bio‐degradable thermal insulator material from recycled wood and silica aerogel. The silica aerogel wood composite (SAWc) has the following properties: 1) low carbon emission (4.932 kg CO 2 e kg −1 ); 2) low thermal conductivity (0.032 W mK −1 ) with an anisotropy of 1.5; 3) high compressive strength (yield stress = 8.60 Mpa); 4) excellent resistance to organic solvents; 5) high biodegradability (49.4% weight loss after 28 days); 6) excellent flame retardancy, both of which are above EPS. The scalable, super‐insulating, and robust thermal insulator, as demonstrated in this work, holds high potential as an alternative packaging material poised to shape the next era in thermal insulation solutions.",

This explains the interest toward developing systems able to remove from wastewater different contaminants, with different susceptibility to removal methods. Consequently, herein hybrid ionic liquid gels, based on 1,3:2,4‐dibenzylidene‐D‐sorbitol (DBS), doped with graphite, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphene oxide, are described. First, the gel–sol transition temperatures ( T gel ), rheological and self‐healing properties are determined. These gels are then used as sorbent materials and, for the first time, for removing mixtures of pollutants of different classes, namely the dyes rhodamine B and methyl orange, the drugs diclofenac and carbamazepine, or the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A, to simulate real wastewaters. Interestingly, hybrid gels prove efficient in removing single and mixed pollutants. The best performing gel is reusable for at least 12 consecutive cycles, without any intermediate washing. It can also be embedded in adsorption columns or dialysis membranes, to treat larger volumes of wastewater. Here, this gel achieves an adsorption capacity of 117 and 66 mg g −1 for rhodamine B and bisphenol A in mixture, with a distinct preference toward cationic contaminants, exhibiting competitive performance with most systems previously reported.",

Increasing the number of V o s in nanostructures provides a foundation for efficient multi‐use catalyst designs that facilitate biomass oxidation reactions and improve electrocatalytic activity. Herein, the trends in the properties of MO‐based catalysts are investigated with varying amounts of V o s achieved by Li‐ion deposition. The controlled introduction of V o s into MO NPs tunes the band structures and surface chemistry, leading to enhanced activities of the NPs as photocatalysts for the selective oxidation of 2,5‐hydroxymethylfurfural and as electrocatalysts for acidic hydrogen evolution. It is believed that Li‐ion deposition in the MO matrix provides a novel approach for optimizing oxide‐based catalyst defect engineering, thereby enabling more efficient biomass conversion and water splitting. These findings contribute significantly to the field of multi‐purpose catalysis and are expected to inspire new catalyst designs for a more sustainable future. The results provide a pathway for the facile and efficient engineering of surface defect structures on catalytic metal oxide NPs toward designing high‐performance photocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Layered lithium oxides (LNCM), with over 60% Ni, are promising cathode materials for electric vehicles due to their high capacity. however, reliable cycling retention cannot easily achieved owing to the instability of the interface. Here, recycled oyster shell (OS) is employed as an efficient precursor for the surface modification of LNCM cathodes; subsequently, Ca‐based artificial cathode–electrolyte interphases (CEI) are obtained at the LNCM interfaces through a simple calcination process. When the pulverized OS is calcined with LNCM cathode materials at elevated temperatures, CaCO 3 is converted to CaO via thermal decomposition at the LNCM interface, which effectively protects the unstable interface. Microscopic analyses indicate the nanodomain island‐type CEI layers embedded after OS calcination. The OS‐coated LNCM cathode materials increase the cycling retention after 100 cycles (93.8% vs. 62.7%) and decrease the internal cell pressure by preventing electrolyte decomposition. Incorporating Ca into the LNCM cathode materials also inhibits microcrack formation because of the improvement in particle hardness and the remarkable decrease in the irreversible dissolution of transition metals from LNCM cathodes, considering that Ca plays a crucial role in scavenging fluoride species. Consequently, recycling OS as a functional LNCM precursor is an innovative approach for enhanced cycling retention.",

In this work, it is reported that robust palladium mesoporous nanospheres (Pd MSs) with electron‐rich active sites perform perfectly as cathode electrocatalyst for electrochemical semi‐hydrogenation of alkynes in water. In comparison to its counterparts, Pd MSs hold remarkable conversion (97%), superior selectivity (98%), good operation stability in selective semi‐hydrogenation of p‐aminophenylene. High performance is assigned to electron‐rich Pd sites within mesopores that not only favor the formation of active H* but also accelerate the desorption of p‐aminostyrene. Meanwhile, Pd MSs are also highly efficient in selective semi‐hydrogenation of various terminal alkynes with different substituents. It is thus expected that robust Pd MSs can be demonstrated as an alternative catalyst design paradigm for other electrochemical hydrogenation reactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This research explores the potential of use of waste scaling deposition from electric geysers (EGWS) to synthesize calcium oxide and address fluoride and nitrate contamination in water. The study adopts a circular economy framework by utilizing the synthesized calcium oxide to modify corn cob biochar through ball‐milling, creating a cost‐effective and environmentally sustainable adsorbent. The adsorbent is characterized and pHpzc analysis of CaO@CBC indicates sustained high adsorption capacities for nitrate and fluoride across a broad pH range (2–11). The adsorption kinetics follow a pseudo‐second‐order model, indicating chemisorption mechanisms. The Langmuir isotherm model fits well, showing high maximum adsorption capacities of 18.36 mg g −1 for fluoride and 19.27 mg g −1 for nitrate, surpassing those reported for other materials. Thermodynamic studies indicate that the uptake reactions of fluoride and nitrate are spontaneous and exothermic. Results from pH studies, XPS analysis, and FTIR offer insights into the adsorption mechanism by suggesting electrostatic attraction, inner‐sphere complexation, and ion exchange. The research establishes the efficacy of CaO‐impregnated biochar derived from electric geyser waste in removing fluoride and nitrate, offering a sustainable solution for water pollution. This work breakthroughs the development of efficient and eco‐friendly adsorbents for water treatment, aligning with the principles of a circular economy.",

This paper proposes a novel hybrid powder‐based additive manufacturing method to fabricate 3D biomass‐derived laser‐induced graphene (3D B‐LIG) structures with customizable geometries and microporous features. This method utilizes two waste sources as feedstock precursors for sustainable graphene production: “black liquor” (sodium lignosulfonate, NaLS) and “white pollution” (polypropylene, PP). Employing a computer‐aided design process, this method allows for the synchronous creation of various freeform macrostructures, with either identical or variable sections. To optimize the formability and processing efficiency of 3D B‐LIG, systematic studies have been conducted. These studies establish the relationship between processing parameters and the resulting structures by controlling the laser parameters and the mixing ratio of NaLS and PP. By leveraging tunable microporous structures with a maximized specific surface area of 485.3 m 2 g −1 , 3D B‐LIG demonstrates exceptional performance in pollutant adsorption (with a maximum adsorption capacity of 283.3 mg g −1 for methylene blue) and energy storage (with a gravimetric specific capacitance value of 194.9 F g −1 ).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fuel cells represent a promising technology for the future decarbonization of the mobility sector. However, the efficient use of H 2 and O 2 to produce electricity still requires noble metal catalysts such as platinum and ruthenium. In particular, the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) is complex and limiting due to its mechanism, which involves the transfer of four electrons and four protons to produce water. The search for alternative catalysts exhibiting high selectivity is progressing at a rapid pace. In this context, this group previously unveiled a homogeneous catalyst based on titanium‐centered tetrapyrazinoporphyrazines (TPyzPz) for the ORR, noting a certain modularity in the selectivity toward either a two‐ or four‐electron reduction reaction. In this study, the influence of different metal centers (magnesium (Mg), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn)) and various substituents is investigated on the tetrapyrazinoporphyrazine ring. The findings indicate a strong dependence of activity and selectivity on these modifications. Notably, cobalt and copper catalysts exhibit a selectivity greater than 90% toward H 2 O production in the ORR. However, alterations to the macrocycle structure significantly affected the reactivity of these catalysts. These new insights highlighted the importance of careful structural design in the development of the next generation of ORR catalysts.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes the combination of solid‐state doping and a two‐step calcination process to successfully prepare the Li 2 Mn 1−x Ni x SiO 4 series of cathode materials, where Ni substitutes Mn at different doping amounts (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08). The use of chemically equivalent Ni 2+ ions to replace Mn 2+ ions is an effective method. Since the ionic radius of Ni 2+ is smaller than that of Mn 2+ , this substitution can create more voids in the lattice structure. These increased voids provide smoother channels for the transport of electrons and lithium ions, thereby improving the material's electrical conductivity. At a Ni doping amount of 0.06, the material exhibits optimal electrochemical performance, achieving a discharge capacity of 155 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C, significantly superior to undoped lithium manganese silicate. The doping of Mn sites with Ni significantly improves the conductivity and lithium‐ion diffusion capabilities of Li 2 MnSiO 4 , revealing the tremendous potential of doping strategies in optimizing the performance of LIBs cathode materials.",

However, the environmental impact of SiNC on marine biota, particularly when they enter the marine environment through wastewater effluents or direct release from maritime coatings, remains poorly understood. Studying their effects is thus crucial for environmental and human health protection, the development of safe‐by‐design ENMs, and informed policy‐making. This study aims to assess the ecotoxicological effects and internalization of industrially‐relevant SiNC in marine phytoplankton, namely on the microalgae Tetraselmis chuii , Nannochloropsis gaditana , and Isochrysis galbana , and diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum , and Chaetoceros calcitrans . For this purpose, a fluorescent nanocarrier (SiNC‐UMB) is developed by labeling the SiNC with the fluorescent natural dye umbelliferone (UMB). UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopic analyses confirmed the successful loading of UMB into SiNC. Phytoplankton can internalize these ENMs, even at low concentrations, although adsorption to the cell wall can also occur. This confirms the internal exposure and growth inhibition observed in the microalgae. These findings highlight the potential of using SiNC‐UMB as a valuable tool for tracking their uptake and assessing their effects on marine biota and beyond.",

Herein, a (FFV) 2 PdCl 2 complex is developed with dynamic coordination engineering between the Pd II site and Fluoflavin (FFV) ligands, and couple it with graphite carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) ultrathin nanosheets to construct a novel Z‐scheme heterojunction ((FFV) 2 PdCl 2 /C 3 N 4 ). The resultant heterojunction delivers a HER activity of 648 µmol h −1 under visible light ( λ ≥ 400 nm) illumination and an apparent quantum yield up to 40.1% at 400 nm, far superior to those g‐C 3 N 4 ‐based catalysts reported previously. Mechanistic and theoretical studies reveal that the dynamic coordination between the Pd II site and FFV ligands not only significantly accelerates the electron transfer from g‐C 3 N 4 to (FFV) 2 PdCl 2 and then to the Pd II sites via a Z‐scheme mechanism, but also effectively maintain the efficacy and stability of the Pd II active sties, and thus the (FFV) 2 PdCl 2 /C 3 N 4 with a ultralow Pd‐loading amount (ca. 0.1 wt.%) exhibits the impressive activity and durability.

Although some investigations have reported activity and durability comparable to Pt/C using biomass‐derived catalysts based on Fe─N─C sites, it remains a challenge to decrease the environmental impact of the production of these materials. A straightforward procedure is developed to obtain excellentORR electrocatalysts from biomass residues which requires a single high‐temperature treatment. The final washing step is avoided by optimizing the initial amount of Fe precursor (FeC 2 O 4 ). Besides the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles, a highly dispersed Fe phase is detected by High Angle Annular Dark Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X‐Ray Spectroscopy (HAADF‐STEM‐XEDS) analysis as well as graphitic carbon structures. The best performance for almond shell‐based electrocatalysts is achieved for the sample containing 4.6 wt. % of Fe. The procedure developed is also applied to oceanic posidonia and eucalyptus residues, also showing excellent ORR behavior. The best sample is studied in a primary Zn‐air battery (ZAB) obtaining a maximum power density of 59 mW cm −2 and 755 mAh gZn −1 capacity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermoelectric materials are potential energy harvesting technologies that enable direct, clean conversion between thermal and electrical energy. The efficacy of thermoelectric energy conversion is influenced by the electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient. Flexibility, manufacturability, and cost‐effectiveness are also important factors. Polymeric nanocomposites offer advantages in these respects. However, the development of conductive‐polymer thermoelectric materials is limited to an in‐plane architecture, which does not resemble common real‐world scenarios. Moreover, existing works have low thermoelectric properties or rely on additives for performance improvement. In this work, a free‐standing thermoelectric nanocomposite foam is fabricated via the integration of thermally activated microspheres. Due to the microstructure, a thermal conductivity as low as 0.03 W m−1 K−1 is achieved, which is lower than reported for aerogels fabricated via freeze‐drying methods. Additionally, the nanocomposite foam can reach a maximum electrical conductivity of 1.13 S cm−1, power factor of 0.12 µW m−1 K−2, and thermoelectric figure of merit of 3.0 × 10−4. The study also evaluated the compressive stiffness and demonstrated the potential for sound absorption. With the unique combination of the thermoelectric, sound absorption, and mechanical behavior, these nanocomposite foams would offer versatile solutions to address the next generation energy harvesting and acoustic absorption applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ferrate (Fe(VI)) is of great interest in energy storage solutions, organic synthesis, and wastewater treatment due to its decent oxidation potential and non‐toxic end‐product formation, making it a green oxidizer. The electrochemical generation of ferrate in NaOH at current densities of j ≥ 100 mA cm −2 is presented using low‐cost sacrificial iron anodes, mild steel, and spheroidal graphite cast iron (ductile iron). Under optimized reaction parameters with 40 wt.% (14 m ) NaOH and a ZrO 2 ‐based diaphragm, spheroidal graphite cast iron shows no signs of passivation in 5 h experiments even at j = 150 mA cm −2 . The results are used in a novel electrolysis cell with a combined geometric anode surface area of 230 cm 2 , incorporated in a mini‐plant suitable for continuous synthesis. This setup produces a peak ferrate concentration of 10.1 g L −1 (84 m m ) after 5 h in 1.6 L anolyte volume, resulting in a total ferrate mass of 16.2 g. Optimal electrolysis temperatures are between 35 and 50 °C. The highest current efficiency is 63.0%, and the lowest specific energy consumption is 9.2 kWh kg −1 ferrate. The presented work is an essential step toward the continuous electrochemical synthesis of ferrate using sacrificial anodes under basic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2 ) is widely used as cathode material for lithium‐ion batteries due to its high operation voltage and high specific capacity. However, conventional LiCoO 2 (LCO) undergoes severe structural phase transitions and compositional changes at high voltage (&gt;4.4 V) leading to failure. Herein, a multifunctional crosslinked polymer interface is insitu formed on LCO particles, which can build a nanoscale conformal coating layer on the interface of LCO, preventing the side reaction with the electrolyte. Moreover, thanks to its high‐voltage talerances and high Li + conductivity, the in‐situ polymerized interface has excellent high‐voltage stability and Li + transport kinetics, which significantly improves the electrochemical performances of LCO at 4.55 or 4.6 V. This study confirms the feasibility of in situ polymer modification of LCO, providing new ideas and methods for the structural stabilization and performance enhancement of high‐voltage lithium cobalt oxides.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In converting CO 2 into useful chemical starting materials, the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) promises to be a major carbon‐utilization strategy, contributing to a carbon‐neutral society. These are proposed using hydrothermal conditions—characterized by high temperature and high pressure—to address the challenges of CO2RR. Technology assessment revealed that the additional energy to create hydrothermal conditions doesnot increase the overall energy demand for chemical production, and the CO 2 emissions from methanol production through hydrothermal electrochemical CO2RR can be negative with the photovoltaic electricity and waste heat supply. Moreover, These experimentally demonstrated promising improvements in the CO2RR process using hydrothermal conditions and elucidated the specific roles of temperature and pressure in promoting CO2RR. An increase in the process temperature to 150 °C, improves the CO 2 diffusion coefficient in water, resulting in the enhancement of current density and the reduction of activation overpotential for CO2RR. On the other hand, the pressurization by CO 2 can prevent the decrease in CO 2 solubility under high‐temperature conditions, keeping a high selectivity of CO2RR. These findings indicate a plausible avenue for the efficient recycling of CO 2 and its integration into the carbon cycle, marking a significant stride toward a sustainable, zero‐emission society.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent developments in iontronic materials and devices highlight the importance of efficient ion conduction in optimizing their performance. In particular, improving ion transport in polymer electrolytes is key to the progress of advanced energy conversion systems. This study presents a novel approach to enhance the ion conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)–NaOH electrolytes within porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites. By coating PDMS with a thin layer of polydopamine (PDA) and filling it with PEO–NaOH, numerous hopping sites are generated at the PEO‐PDA interface for efficient Na + transport, thereby improving ion conductivity. Additionally, by combining the broadband absorption of PDA with the scattering properties of porous PDMS, the ability of the PDA–PDMS composite to efficiently absorb and convert solar radiation into heat is demonstrated. The generated heat is confined to the light‐exposed region due to the thermal insulation provided by the porous PDMS. This confinement creates a temperature gradient across the composite, preferentially enhancing the thermal diffusion of Na + cations over OH − anions to generate thermoelectric voltage. This unique property allows for the direct conversion of solar energy into electrical energy, offering new possibilities for sustainable and efficient energy technologies.",

A sustainable, fast, and selective extraction technique for rare earth metals hardly exists despite that. This work shows a selective rare earth metal recovery from a mobile phone display using a carboxylate functionalized cellulose (CFC). The nanoengineered CFC is water‐dispersible and prepared from affordable, readily available cellulose precursor. It is shown that the REEs present in the mobile phone display instantaneously form a precipitate with CFC, which is easily separated by centrifugation. As low as 150 ppm, the total concentration of REEs in the leachate is required to form a precipitate. The total removal capacity of the REEs in the leachate is 252 ± 4 mg per gram of CFC. In addition, the precipitate formation occurs within 10 s, which to our knowledge, is the best‐reported removal time so far. It is observed that when the total concentration of the REEs in the leachate is 150 ppm or above, the removal capacity of CFC is quite efficacious and unperturbed by the presence of other metal ions. Solar electrodeposition method is utilized to recover rare earth metal and their oxide from the precipitate.",

Development of materials that can catalytically convert CO 2 and water vapor into hydrocarbons under sunlight has been one of the most formidable challenges in the 21st century. This study have recently demonstrates that by introducing hydrophilic and hydrophobic sites on nanostructured TiO 2 ‐reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite surfaces, yield of methane from photoreduction of CO 2 can be enhanced by ≈30%. Here this study reports the study of reaction kinetics for TiO 2 ‐rGO photocatalysts through pressure and temperature dependent measurements of the product yield. By applying the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model on the pressure dependent CO 2 conversion data, the reaction rates are calculated for selective adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O on the photocatalyst surface. These data are correlated with charge transport studies done through current‐voltage ( I – V ) characteristics of the photocatalyst measured in presence of CO 2 and H 2 O. On the other hand, a unique solar‐concentrator based reactor design is developed. Such a prototype allows about a 20 °C rise in the temperature that enhances the rates of photocatalytic reactions. A comparative study of the CO 2 photoreduction experiments in absence and in presence of the concentrated sunlight are presented.",

To solve this, an effective electrolyte combination consisting of 1,1‐diethoxyethane (DEE) and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) is used in this work, which can provide an organic/inorganic‐hybridized solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the Li anode. The DEE solvent affords flexible carbon‐abundant components, whereas LiFSI offers mechanically rigid lithium fluoride‐type components; these undergo electrochemical reduction to form SEI layers that are balanced in terms of organic and inorganic components. Systematic analysis results exhibit that when the SEI layer integrated with DEE and LiFSI is embedded in the lithium anode, electrolyte decomposition, and dendritic lithium growth are suppressed in Li/Li cells, thereby improving surface stability. Similarly, it provides stable cycle life characteristics even at 150 cycles in Li/S cells (72.0% vs 52.6%).",

A reversible capacity of 230 mAh g −1 combined with an excellent capacity retention of ≈85% after 1000 cycles versus Na/Na + is demonstrated in a NaPF 6 ‐DME electrolyte. Such a promising electrochemical performance is achieved by the synergy of the NCO particle nanosizing, and the formation of a thin, but stable and Na + ‐permeable solid electrolyte interface layer that builds‐up readily in the NaPF 6 ‐1,2‐dimethoxyethane electrolyte. The feasibility of the nanosized NCO anode for SIBs is also confirmed in a full sodium‐ion cell versus Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 cathode, and the discharge potential is as high as 2.0 V suggesting a promising energy density.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ongoing problems in western countries connected to the global energy supply urgently force the research community to strive in finding new methodologies for boosting the functional properties of earth‐abundant raw materials, for example, the largely available cupreous oxide. In this work, the authors focus on the surface sensitization of this metal oxide semiconductor with an argon plasma treatment, that promotes, during photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution, the formation of metallic copper nanostructures. Interestingly, these copper‐based hierarchical nano‐branches, having inherent plasmonic properties, are at the origin of the improved shelf‐life of the modified Cu 2 O photocathode, as is demonstrated by advanced structural and photophysical analyses. This proposed photophysical mechanism for an operando electrode stabilization suggests that a self‐healing process can occur within the Cu 2 O/plasmonic Cu heterostructure. These findings pave the way to the implementation of new, easy‐to‐make strategies to improve the properties of low‐cost, low‐toxicity energy materials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A crucial factor in advancing the broad utilization of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the development of efficient catalysts with sufficient active sites. Herein, a hydrothermal approach is utilized to fabricate helical chain stacked two‐dimensional (2D) tellurium (Te) nanoflakes, whose HER performance hasn't been systematically studied yet. It is found that Te nanoflakes transferred on carbon fiber paper (CFP) exhibit impressive HER properties and show a load dependence. The overpotential required for HER is significantly reduced to 279 mV under a load condition of 0.86 mg cm −2 at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further systematically carried out on Te catalytic sites along the helical chain at [0001] direction with a threefold screw symmetry. It is found that the Gibbs free energy of adsorbed hydrogen atom (ΔG H* ) on Te sites is significantly lower than that of molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ). Besides, the active sites based on surface atom density calculation reveal that Te provides more adsorption sites than layered MoS 2 . The decreased adsorption energy and efficient adsorption sites in Te may highlight the promising application of elemental crystal Te in electrocatalytic hydrogen production and pave the way for developing new types of electrocatalysts.",

Current reports adopting a layered stack structure often suffer from inadequate interlayer adhesion, leading to problems such as out‐of‐plane bending and delamination, as well as insufficient power density and energy density. In this context, a novel and straightforward methodology is introduced, employing in situ oxidation of molybdenum foil, a customized kirigami‐island‐bridge (KIB) structure, and an overall cast molding technique. This approach facilitates the integration of degradable primary batteries with enhanced power density (3.41 mW cm −2 ) and energy density (3.54 mWh cm −2 ). Furthermore, the battery sustains an output of 50 µA cm −2 under cyclic 20% strain stretching for ≈3 h, showcasing its specific stretchability performance, and is successfully implemented in sensors for real‐time monitoring of body movements. This study presents a novel approach to the development of wearable, biodegradable, and medical electronics, offering potential pathways for sustainable technological advancement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sulfone liquids can be used as solvents for high‐voltage electrolytes and have been extensively studied for their strong oxidation resistance. However, the problem of high viscosity and susceptibility to side reactions with metallic lithium has been the subject of criticism. To solve the issue of incompatibility with lithium, researchers adopted a high‐concentration electrolyte, namely solvent‐in‐salt, which allows the anions in the lithium salt to preferentially contact the surface of the lithium metal and react to form an SEI film to block the reaction between sulfone solvents and lithium. However, the issue of high viscosity is particularly severe. This work proposes a new solvent model called “solvent‐in‐diluent” electrolyte to address both of these issues simultaneously, different from previous models of salt‐in‐solvent, the model not only effectively prevents sulfone contact with lithium metal surfaces, but also maintains a capacity retention rate of 82% after 500 cycles in the voltage range of 2.8–4.6 V, additionally, the temperature range in which the battery can operate using this electrolyte model has been extended (−20–60°C). This work proposes a new solvent model and challenges the minimum concentration of high‐voltage electrolytes (0.04 m ), providing a new approach and possibility for studying high‐voltage electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Poly ethylene oxide (PEO) composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are one of the most promising candidates for all‐solid‐state batteries with high energy density, flexibility and safety. However, the applications of PEO with practicability have been refrained from its poor tensile strength, limited Li‐ion migration and ionic conductivity. In this work, the compact and stable flexible CPEs are prepared by PEO matrix with dual‐fillers of LiBH4 and Al2O3, where Al2O3 with Lewis acid sites can weaken the complexation of Li+ and PEO as well as enhance the dissociation of Li salts. Meanwhile LiBH4 acts as fast ion conductor to provide free Li+ at the interfaces between fillers and PEO. Benefiting from their synergistic effects, both ionic conductivity and interface stability between electrolyte and anode of CPEs are improved greatly while the lithium dendrites is also inhibited. As a result, the PEO/Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide(LiTFSI)/(4%LiBH4/4%γ‐Al2O3) CPEs exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 0.3 mS cm−1 and the Li‐Li symmetrical battery can cycle for 800 h at 60 °C.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Indoor carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels are often significantly higher than those outdoors, which is a growing health concern, particularly in urban areas where people spend over 80% of their time indoors. Traditional CO 2 mitigation methods, such as ventilation and filtration, are becoming less effective as outdoor CO 2 levels increase due to global warming. This study introduces a novel solution: cyanobacterial artificial plants that enhance indoor carbon capture while converting CO 2 into oxygen (O 2 ) and bioelectricity. These artificial plants use indoor light to drive photosynthesis, achieving a 90% reduction in indoor CO 2 levels, from 5000 to 500 ppm—far surpassing the 10% reduction seen with natural plants. In addition to improving air quality, the system produces O 2 and enough bioelectricity to power portable electronics. Each artificial leaf contains five biological solar cells that generate electricity during photosynthesis, with water and nutrients supplied through transpiration and capillary action, mimicking natural plant systems. The system generates an open circuit voltage of 2.7 V and a maximum power output of 140 µW. This decentralized approach offers a sustainable, energy‐efficient solution to indoor environmental challenges, providing improved air quality and renewable electricity amid rising global CO 2 levels.",

Herewith, a one‐pot strategy utilizing polyacryloyl hydrazide (PAHz) as the composition directing agent and metallic Ni surface as the shape directing agent is employed to grow Co 3 O 4 doped NiCu alloy nanocuboids on Ni foam (NF) under hydrothermal conditions for electrocatalytic H 2 production. The resulting bi‐functional electrodes are suitable for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) coupled green H 2 production with effective energy efficiency. The low overall potential (MOR+HER) of 1.78 V to realize the current density ( j ) value of 100 mA cm −2 and extended durability (100 h@10 mA cm −2 ) along with the selective conversion of methanol to formate support the viability of the NF‐PAHz‐Co 3 O 4 @NiCu for the said operation. The electrode also displays efficacy toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and j OER value of 100 mA cm −2 is realized at a potential value of 1.65 V RHE with adequate durability. Overall, the synthetic strategy is general, scalable and may be extended to grow other metal oxide doped alloy nanostructures in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cerium‐containing titania nano‐octahedra (CeTNOh) are obtained by ultrasonication‐hydrothermal synthesis of Ce‐containing titanate nanowires (0.35, 0.46, and 0.70 Ce mol %) from commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25). CeTNOh are tested as photocatalysts to degrade a target pollutant (ciprofloxacin) under simulated solar light and at mild conditions. CeTNOh are anatase polymorphs with increasing crystallite size as Ce content increases. Hydrothermal treatments enhance the specific surface area (SSA) compared to P25, although Ce addition slightly reduces SSA while increasing crystallite size. Electron Microscopy confirms the morphology, although higher Ce levels hinder a full transformation. X‐ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) shows the presence of Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ redox pair, promoting electron mobility and Ti‐Ce interactions. Optical and electronic spectroscopy reveals that Ce loading reduces the bandgap from 3.20 to 2.74 eV, extending light absorption into the visible range, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. The best sample, CeTNOh0.35, achieved 83% degradation of ciprofloxacin after 360 minutes under solar irradiation, with poor adsorption in the dark period. Higher Ce loadings negatively affect photoactivity by partially covering titania active sites. Reusability tests confirm the stability and efficiency of CeTNOh0.35 over three cycles, highlighting the importance of octahedral morphology in Ce‐containing systems to boost the final photoactivity for water remediation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable attention in catalysis due to their exceptional structural and chemical tunability. However, high electrical conductivity is rare in MOFs, hindering their practical applications toward catalytic reactions. Recently, 2D topological MOFs stand out for the unique topologically nontrivial electronic structures. Particularly, their high electrical conductivity and chemical tunability make them promising candidates as high‐performance catalysts. In this study, theoretical investigations are conducted into the intrinsic electronic properties and chemical activity of a 2D topological Cu‐1,3,5‐tris(pyridyl)benzene (Cu‐TPyB) framework. It is found that the coordination environment of Cu with pyridyl groups plays a crucial role in modulating the electron density around the Fermi level, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of Cu‐TPyB toward electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, substituting the single embedded Cu atom with Cu 3 and Cu 4 Bi 3 clusters further increases the electron density around the Fermi level. Specifically, the Cu 4 Bi 3 ‐TPyB framework exhibits superior HER activity, which is attributed to its high electron density contributed by the p orbitals of Bi and the d orbitals of Cu. This work introduces a novel approach for optimizing the catalytic activity of 2D MOFs and developing high‐performance catalysts.",

Here, a straightforward hydrothermal procedure is used to synthesize MoSe 2 nanosheets (NSs) and focus on their adsorption capabilities and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The MoSe 2 NSs which are synthesized by 12 h of hydrothermal treatment found to exhibit the highest adsorption capacity of 91.67 mg g −1 . The kinetics of the adsorption process have been found to follow the pseudo‐second‐order model, signifying chemisorption and multilayer adsorption as described by the Freundlich isotherm. The thermodynamic analysis further suggests that the adsorption proceeds by endothermic and spontaneous mechanisms. The self‐cleaning property of the adsorbent is demonstrated by degrading the dye on the adsorbent‐coated cotton fabric. The sample created using a 12 h hydrothermal method has been shown to have a minimal Tafel slope of 58 mV dec −1 . It also shows excellent HER activity at low over‐potential and possesses long‐term durability. The dual functionality of MoSe 2 NSs in both adsorption and electrocatalytic activity highlights their potential for application in environmental remediation and renewable energy production.",

This study introduces Fresnel lenses to focus sunlight for the sintering of mesoporous titanium dioxide (m‐TiO 2 ) layers as an innovative method for fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs), effectively circumventing the energy‐intensive and carbon‐emitting high‐temperature furnace sintering traditionally required. Through this concentrated solar annealing technique, an efficient and eco‐friendly sintering of the m‐TiO 2 layer is successfully achieved by removing organic residues from the precursor film and enhancing the film's transmittance, electrical conductivity, and grain size. Consequently, this has led to improved coverage of the perovskite layer and enhanced overall photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. Experimental results indicate that the m‐TiO 2 film subjected to 60 min of concentrated sunlight sintering (CSS) demonstrates optimal photovoltaic performance, with the fabricated compact‐layer‐free PSCs achieving an impressive photoelectric conversion efficiency of up to 17.69%. This research not only offers a novel, cost‐effective approach for the sustainable production of PSCs but also contributes tangible solutions for the green transformation of the photovoltaic industry and the achievement of carbon neutrality.

    "abstract": "Dear Readers, 2020 has been a year that none of us will forget. From the early reports of an outbreak of a mysterious and deadly lung disease at the twilight of 2019 to a full-blown, once-in-a-generation global pandemic that has cost over one million lives worldwide, 2020 has been a confusing, challenging and confronting year for all. As the economies of countries all over the world went into lockdown to help slow the spread of the disease now known as COVID-19, and the world-economy slumped into deep recession, we at Wiley and Advanced Sustainable Systems drew together in the new normal determined to serve our research community. With the Wiley editorial staff having successfully transitioned to working from home, it quickly became obvious that work in the research community and the desire to disseminate high-impact research was as high as ever, if not higher. Submissions to Advanced Sustainable Systems doubled in 2020 compared to the previous year. The continued strong growth of published articles demonstrates that Advanced Sustainable Systems has become a well-established high-quality journal for researchers with a focus on sustainability. Early research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus causing COVID-19) had its likely origin in wild animals. Such animals are increasingly coming into contact with humans as their natural habitats are being destroyed by humans. As with climate change, zoonotic pathogens (e.g. viruses or bacteria that infect animals and that have mutated and jumped to human hosts) are a direct consequence of humankind's excesses. Our unsustainable way of living, of doing business, of making and distributing goods, comes with severe consequences. This natural catastrophe represents an opportunity to radically shift and reset our focus. The technology to tackle most sustainability issues, as spelled out in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), already exists, but we require a mighty political, societal and financial effort to employ it to full effect. We must take responsibility and double down on our sustainability efforts. At its inception in 2017, Advanced Sustainable Systems aimed to advance the common goal of sustainable living. The journal is a reflection on, and the product of, the need of the scientific community for a high-impact journal specializing in sustainability and sustainable technologies research. As we enter our fifth year of publication, 2020 has truly propelled this journal from infancy straight to adulthood. Over the last four years, this journal and our community of authors has grown, reflected by the number of published articles, a near tripling year on year over the last year alone, and we anticipate Volume 5 becoming our biggest volume yet. Our efforts to establish Advanced Sustainable Systems as a premium journal for outstanding research on sustainable technologies is demonstrated by our first ever impact factor, a 2019 Impact Factor of 4.869 (Journal Citation Reports (Clarivate Analytics, 2020)). Without the outstanding contributions from our authors, this would not have been possible, and we would like to express our most sincere gratitude to our authors for choosing to publish in Advanced Sustainable Systems. It is also not too surprising that our most accessed articles in 2020 are those covering sustainable development goals (SDGs) on sustainable food and agriculture, ecology and urban development, and sustainable living (SDGs 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 14 and 15). Specific topics include, for instance: water purification membranes (article number 1900114), circular waste management (article number 2000023) and lithium battery recycling (article number 1900088). Biomass and biofuels have received increased attention globally as a sustainable alternative of fossil fuels. We have organized a special issue on “Catalytic Technologies for Renewable Biomass Conversion” guest-edited by Prof. Longlong Ma (Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion, China) and Prof. Bert F. Sels (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium). Various aspects of biomass conversion and utilization are featured with an emphasis on the catalytic hydrogenolysis for transformation of biomass feedstock to fuel additives, chemicals, and polymer building blocks. One important part of sustainable development is the transition to renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. One of our upcoming 2021 special issues will focus on this topic and showcase sustainable materials for solar energy conversion and storage. Recognizing the recent advances in the area of green electronics, Clara Santato (University of Montreal, Canada), Lan Yin (Tsinghua University, China), Maria Holuszko (University of British Columbia, Canada) and Mihai Irimia-Vladu (JKU, Austria) are guest-editing two special issues that will be published in Advanced Materials Technologies and Advanced Sustainable Systems this year. The two parallel special issues will cover all aspects of green electronics, such as materials and technologies for more sustainable electronic devices, their environmental impact, and life cycle analyses. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated structural change, is set to upend entire industries, and has already shifted paradigms the world over. However, we need to move forward sustainably, as we cannot go back to our old ways. Sustainability goals can be met through technology-driven advancement, and Advanced Sustainable Systems plays a major part in this by publishing high-quality research results furthering the advancement of sustainable living. Towards the end of last year, we simplified the submission and transfer process for authors. All Advanced and Small journals and most of their sister journals now have a single concise set of article types. The most notable change is the discontinuation of the article types “Communication” and “Full Paper”, which are replaced by “Research Article” and can contain original research studies of any length. More information on the article types can be found here, specifically under “Article Types”. We believe this is a significant step towards making life easier for our authors, readers and reviewers as it greatly reduces the need for formatting in general and reformatting after transfer to a sister journal. It also brings us one step closer to free-format submissions. This initiative is part of a global project across Wiley and you will see similar changes to Wiley's complete portfolio of journals. It underlines the efforts Wiley is undertaking to make life easier for researchers when preparing, submitting and reading manuscripts. We would like to thank all our colleagues and board members at Advanced Sustainable Systems. And to all our readers, we wish you a healthy and successful 2021. Yours sincerely, Aron Urbatsch on behalf of the editorial team Editor Advanced Sustainable Systems",

Herein, a novel heterogenization approach is presented for a homogeneous photocatalyst assembled into a biomass‐based aerogel for photocatalytic performance that can be easily recycled and reused. The efficiency of light harvesting and H 2 O absorption is considerably higher because of the presence of multihydroxy groups in the aerogel and its high porosity, which further promotes the photocatalytic H 2 evolution activity up to 30 mmol g −1 h −1 , and 20 mmol g −1 h −1 in the actual sunlight reaction. The industrial application prospect of this approach for solar‐to‐chemical energy conversion is evident based on the facile and simple synthesis strategy, excellent photocatalytic performance, and easy recyclability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lithium metal batteries, in particular lithium–sulfur chemistries, hold great promise in energy storage from potentially increased gravimetric storage density and diminished reliance on transition metals, lowering resource demand and hence overall unit cost. However, these cells can have their feasibility improved to a greater extent by lowering the demand for lithium within their construction and reducing the polysulfide shuttling effect. Rising lithium costs and a lack of recycling options indicate the use of excess lithium to mitigate cycling stability issues is sub‐optimal. Herein, the direct casting of a lithophilic, superglassy, nanoporous PTMSP polymer separator directly onto the lithium anode is described. PTMSP's bi‐modal, sub‐angstrom pore size distribution results in selective rejection of polysulfide species, while its high fractional free volume acts as a stabilizing matrix for deposited lithium as well as possessing a high ionic conductivity of 8.8 × 10 ‐4 S cm −1 . The coated anodes exhibit 5.7 times more dense lithium over controls, translating to improved cycling performance due to increased capacity retention and improved lithium utilization at low (&lt; 3) N/P ratios for extended cycle life (&gt; 250 cycles), at practical sulfur loadings (4 mg cm −2 ). These developments are promising steps for more widespread adoption of lithium sulfur batteries and other metallic lithium systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work focuses on the development of a new method to utilize deposited coke on zeolite catalysts, formed during the plastic waste cracking. Nitrogen‐doped carbon catalysts are prepared using nylon‐66 and Zn 2+ ion‐exchanged ZSM‐5 zeolites. After the cracking reaction, nitrogen‐doped carbon materials are obtained by removing zeolites from zeolite/coke composites using base and acid treatment. The synthesized N‐doped carbon using Zn 2+ type ZSM‐5 zeolites exhibits higher catalytic performance on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with an onset potential of 0.95 V (vs RHE) and a half‐wave potential of 0.80 V (vs RHE) than that using H + type ZSM‐5 zeolites. The characterization revealed that the evaporation of Zn 2+ in zeolites significantly enhanced the porosity of N‐doped carbon. Moreover, the aromatization and poly‐cyclization reactions promoted the generation of highly active edge Valley‐N sites, leading to their outstanding activity on ORR. This work provides new directions for the utilization of deposited coke on zeolites.",

Calcium doped magnesium oxide reveals notably increased water dissociation rates, compared to pure MgO, enhancing both rate and reaction completeness of the hydration. For a series of mixed magnesium-calcium oxides (MgxCa1−xO) with varying Ca-contents between 0 and 40% the material of a composition Mg0.9Ca0.1O shows the fastest rehydration, transforming completely within 80 minutes to the mixed hydroxide. In consecutive dehydration/rehydration cycles reasonable cycle stability is found. A “regeneration” of the aged material (reactivity reduced by excessive cycling) in liquid water re-establishes the initial rehydration reactivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the experimental findings, confirming that calcium doping can reduce the energy of the rate limiting water dissociation reaction exploiting both electronic and steric (size) effects.",

    "abstract": "Sustainability. A keyword that we encounter (almost) everywhere. In recent years, if not decades, the desire for more sustainability has grown worldwide. Logically, this desire has led to major changes, whether in economic, operational or political terms. In scientific terms, the main focus is on making life and the economy itself climate-friendly and resource-saving. The journal Advanced Sustainable Systems offers a platform for scientists across all scientific disciplines to publish research results on climate compatibility and resource efficiency. After its launch in 2017 the still very young journal has now completed its second year of publishing high-quality science in the field of sustainability. It is thus time to go on a fact-finding mission and take a look at a few numbers describing how Advanced Sustainable Systems has developed. As announced in our previous editorial, the journal is now included in Web of Science (the Emerging Sources Citation Index) having logged 196 citations (all numbers are as of Nov 30th, 2018 – the time of writing this Editorial). The 140 published primary and review articles have been downloaded a total of ∼ 65 000 times. Both numbers are encouraging and reflect high interest from our growing community. With increasing numbers of submissions in 2018, we are also able to be more and more selective with the published content (the reject rate has increased by 35%) in order to ensure high quality for our readers. An international, inter-disciplinary journal can only flourish if its authorship is as diverse as possible. we strive therefore, to have a globally balanced distribution of authors. Figure 1 shows a geographic visualization of where the corresponding authors of all published articles originate from. Top countries are China, the US, Australia and Korea, followed by Germany and Italy. The articles of particular interest shown in Figure 2 (selected due to high download numbers and a wide distribution via social media such as blogs, posts and news platforms) nicely reflect both the bandwidth of the published topics in the journal as well as the diverse backgrounds of our authors. Who does not long for comfortable room temperatures without the associated costs for heating or cooling? Smart Windows must certainly be a good answer (adsu.201700140). An important step towards green electronics: This unexpected paper-based material for ‘papertronics’ combines flexibility with biodegradability, low cost, sustainability and bacteria-derived energy (adsu.201800041). Waste as a valuable resource. Oil pollution, be it from tanker accidents at sea or from drilling, is an environmentally unfriendly side effect. Effective materials for the removal of such pollution are in demand (adsu.201800024). Underwater property: the key issue for future solar distillation. Find out how Pitaya-like structured photothermal materials survive 6 atm in the black (adsu.201700145). Sustainability trends such as life after coal, extreme weather conditions in urban development, bio-based materials, solar energy in the historic cityscape, microplastics in the environment, and many more, are published in the form of expert opinions and essays in our journal. Two recent essays of particular note discuss topics of key concern to the 21st century community. Mario Pagliaro and co-authors give an exciting and critical overview of Decentralized solar energy systems in cities. Claudia Kemfert examines the energy system transformation and is especially dedicated to the necessity of coal phase-out. In the near future, Expert Opinions will be published on consequences in urban development with regard to extreme weather conditions and on biobased materials in the circular economy. We are convinced that this format will be of great interest to our readers. Expertise guarantees quality. We thank all the countless reviewers who keep the standards and quality of our journal high. Special thanks to our most diligent reviewers: Dr. Ali Coskun, Professor Franceso Meinardi, Dr. Marin Sawa, Dr. Li Yu, and Professor Jia Zhu. We would also like to express our gratitude for your interest in Advanced Sustainable Systems to all of you, our editorial board members, authors, and last but not least, our readers. Wishing you a peaceful, joyful, successful, and sustainable Year 2019.",

The fabricated photocathodes exhibit excellent performances in photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction due to the advantages of 3D MoS2, which reduces the overpotential of Si photocathode by abundant edge sites exposed to the ambient and increases the absorption of sun light by antireflection effect. This strategy paves the way for the development of efficient catalysts for solar water splitting, the so called artificial photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Dear reader, Recently, in our editorial office, the paper towels for hand drying in the bathroom were exchanged for re-usable cotton towel rolls. A message from the facilities team praised this as significant move towards a more sustainable office environment. A statement that seems rather bold given that these cotton towel rolls must be washed quite frequently and would therefore generate wastewater. On the other “hand”, they create less solid waste obviously. As editors of scientific journals, we were keen to look at the underlying data behind this sustainability claim and found there was none. Such claims are often made nowadays. One prominent (but certainly not exclusive) example for this is the car industry were politicians and manufacturers claim sustainable transport because electric vehicles do not emit toxic components from the exhaust pipe. Looking at this fact only, this statement might seem to be true. However, looking at the whole lifecycle of the vehicle including the manufacturing process and the end-of-life solution, the image gets blurred. Many aspects play into this: resource availability, fair wages, transportation of product parts, user behavior, recycling potential, just to name a few, which are by no means unique to the car manufacturing industry. Data on these aspects are not easily collected and analyzed (yet). And then the answer to questions of sustainability is never yes or no. Advanced Sustainable Systems set out with the aim of publishing research addressing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. In the last three years we have come a long way, but we know that we still have a long way to go to achieve our goal. Given that the roots of our brand are in the area of materials science, we are in a strong position to publish important contributions on sustainability challenges in key areas of materials science such as catalysis, plastic recycling and renewable energies. However, we have also started publishing more and more articles in adjacent fields and aim to further broaden the scope and are sure that you will appreciate and support this move. You will be pleased to know that at the very end of 2019 Advanced Sustainable Systems has been selected for coverage in Clarivate Analytics products, including the Journal Citation Reports. This means that the journal will receive its first Impact Factor in 2020. We thank all our authors who supported us throughout the first three years, our board members and reviewers for their critical guidance in developing the journal. Finally, we would like to thank our readers for reading and sharing the articles we publish. An overview of a few of the great articles published in Advanced Sustainable Systems can be found in the Tables 1 and 2. Reviewers may be pleased to know that from now on our journal provides the option to have your activity recorded in your ORCID record; you will need to have and provide an ORCID iD for this. To receive credit for your review, please opt in to this feature when you submit your reviewer report to the editorial office. You may need to log in to ORCID to confirm your authorization. Your identity as a reviewer will be protected; no manuscript or author details would be shown in your ORCID profile and your information will not be shared with the author. Open Access publication is becoming ever more important. A landmark agreement was signed in January 2019 between Wiley and Projekt DEAL which provides Open Access publication in and read access to most of Wiley's journals to a vast majority of German academic institutions. Advanced Sustainable Systems, together with its sister journals in the Advanced family, is covered by this agreement. It allows corresponding authors based at these German institutes to publish their articles in our journal under an Open Access license, while costs are covered by their institutions under this agreement. Learn more about the agreement with Projekt DEAL here and find out if your institution is a participant in this program here. Coming back to the cotton towel rolls: it seems proven at least that they produce significantly less solid waste and have a lower global warming, acidification, and overfertilization potential compared to paper towels. Also, concerning the whole lifecycle, they consume less energy and produce less air pollution. On the negative side is the significantly higher water consumption (not only for cleaning but also for wool cultivation). Considering also that developing countries, where working conditions may not yet be in alignment with highest ethical standards, are the biggest cotton wool producers, the question remains if this can be called a sustainable application. The question of sustainability is a question of detailed differentiation. We believe that scientific collaboration, thorough data collection and analysis, as well as substantiated discussion will be pivotal for creating a sustainable future. Advanced Sustainable Systems is the forum for sharing research results on these topics and we welcome your next paper! We wish you all the best for 2020. Sincerely, Till von Graberg, on behalf of the editorial team of Advanced Sustainable Systems",

In this work, such approaches are integrated, converting CO 2 into ethanol by using polluted air as feeding gas. More specifically, recycled permanently polarized hydroxyapatite catalysts are prepared by applying a thermally stimulated polarization process to pork, beef, and chicken scrapped bones. The recycled bone catalysts are used to perform a series of reactions fed with polluted air and only powered with solar energy using a solar furnace. Reactions are conducted for 5 days and 1 month. Results demonstrate significant decarbonization, converting CO 2 into valuable chemical products with high selectivity toward ethanol (up to 99.6%).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The process of transferring high‐quality graphene‐based films onto the surface of the electrode is very complicated and is one of the main bottlenecks in using graphene or graphene‐based protecting layers with semiconductors that are electrochemically vulnerable in harsh pH conditions. To address this, an approach is implemented for direct deposition of carbon nanodots on the surface of GaN electrodes, instead of graphene films. Instead of isolating the GaN surface from the electrolyte, the carbon nanodots function as a catalyst, expediting charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. This fast charge‐transfer process prevents accumulation of photoholes on the GaN surface, thereby improving stability. These photoholes, formed in the presence of basic electrolytes, are considered to be the main reason for photocorrosion. The effect of the surface dispersion of the carbon nanodots on the overall performance of the electrode is also studied. A significant improvement in the photocurrent density (0.44 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V vs RHE) is obtained for the optimized sample as compared to that of the bare GaN sample (0.34 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V vs RHE). Moreover, the stability performance is also improved, with almost 87% retention of the initial current value after 3 h of chronoamperometric measurements.",

Preparing binder‐free electrodes is an attractive strategy to make battery electrode production and its end‐of‐use waste greener and safer. Herein, electrospinning is employed to prepare binder‐free and self‐standing electrodes. Such electrodes often suffer from low flexibility, and the correlation between performance and flexibility is usually overlooked. Processing parameters affect the mechanical properties of the electrodes, and for the first time it is reported that mechanical flexibility directly influences the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The importance is highlighted when processing parameters advantageous to powder materials, such as a higher heat treatment temperature, harm self‐standing electrodes due to deterioration of fiber flexibility. Other strategies, such as conductive carbon addition, can be employed to improve the cell performance, but their effect on the mechanical properties of the electrodes must be considered. Rapid heat treatment achieves self‐standing V 2 O 3 with a capacity of 250 mAh g −1 at 250 mA g −1 and 390 mAh g −1 at 10 mA g −1",

However, an evaluation method for the service life of scrapped copper wires is lacking to date. In this work, a data‐based, multicategorized solution is built to rationally assess evolution law of economic value with time flow for recycled copper‐cored wires, covering their one‐way full cycle including reproduction, storage and sale, and final utilization. Here, the results of reproduced cycles, product life, and service life are logically integrated to establish an inherent relation between engineering and sociology by computer science. Such work provides a multiangle perspective for the value evolution emerging in reproduction/application of waste resources. The basic method originating from the current research is expected to throw light on assessing similar scenes.",
